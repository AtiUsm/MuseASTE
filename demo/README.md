# Demo
This demo gives you a sneak-peek in to one of our cars of our dataset. We created topic and ASTE labels for one car (example_demp.csv), and implemented this demo using streamlit

Requirements:
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install streamlit
pip install networkx
pip install streamit-extras
pip install st-annotated-text
```
Or:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the code:

```
streamlit run demo.py

```
