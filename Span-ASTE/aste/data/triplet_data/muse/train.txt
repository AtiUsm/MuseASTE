But it doesn't light up the tires , either . That's really nice . I think we should expect to see this sort of system on other MGs in the future because it works really , really well . The original AMG GT s from a couple of years ago had to be completely honest . Bizarre steering spoke early light , ultra quick . No real sense of connection at all . I just meant that you felt nervous in the car for the 1st 2030 miles . It took a long time to actually get used to it . With this GT-R , they proved it massively . They just calmed it down , taken some of the hyperactivity out a little bit . And so now it's just so much more intuitive . You can start to pour the car into a corner in dry conditions . You feel like you've got a good sense of connection to the front axle . And even though those front wheels are a 1,000,000 miles away , you really felt like you could get right on top of it on the way into a corner . This car's also got rear wheel steering . That's kind of standard across the board for ultra high performance cars these days , and you can feed it working at low speeds at very low speeds . I mean , when you're maneuvering around , you can just feel the rear axle helping the Carter negotiated higher speed , you're not aware of it . I think one of the important things about this car dynamically is that it's kind of got a narrow operating window . So get it on track . We'll get it on a smooth road on a dry road , and it is spectacularly good fun . It feels exciting . It feels raw . It's focused . It's really , really good to drive involving communicative . But when you get it on a bumpy road , and when it starts raining , it's just out of its depth that it stops working and then actually becomes a proper handful .#### #### ####[([24], [33, 11, 11, 37], 'POS'), ([103], [133, 134], 'POS'), ([69, 19, 162, 163], [156], 'POS'), ([82], [62, 213, 214], 'POS'), ([280, 281], [279], 'NEG'), ([309], [310], 'POS'), ([309], [314], 'POS'), ([309], [317], 'POS'), ([325], [11, 11, 156], 'POS'), ([336, 295], [353, 224], 'NEG')]

But the seventh hi adjustment in the sea that you can then transform it to quite a high driving position like you'd expect from an SCV . And because there's plenty of head room , you're able to do that even if you're quite so . If there's so much adjustment in this seat , any problem we have with it is this is the optional electric seats that depending on how you tilt the button , it kind of all moves in different ways in spending ages , trying to , like , get the exact angle and how you want it . That's my only complaint because of seats are quite nice , as is the driving position itself . Loads of interest .

For now , One of the things that makes it much more nimble than it should be is the fact that it has dynamic rear wheel steering . So not only do the front wheel steer , but the back wheel steer is well , and that has to benefits first and foremost . When you're on a curvy road , it allows the car thio more accurately carve a corner because the rear wheels are also steering . And , of course , perhaps that the biggest and most noticeable difference between a regular front wheel steer car , all wheel steer cars that gives you much tighter turning radius . In fact , Audi says that this has the exact same turning radius oven Audi A4 , which is saying a lot because Audi A4 is but smaller than this .

The first thing is the engine . So the X1 comes with the same two litre turbo charged four cylinder That's in a lot of BMW thes days , produces somewhere around 230 horsepower somewhere around 260 foot pounds of torque . And for city driving , it was actually an excellent engine . The thing about turbocharged engines is you get so much Lohan torque that getting off the line like away from a stoplight or stop sign . It's just so effortless and so easy from that experience , it was actually really positive driving around town because it felt like it had plenty of grunt to get up to speed quickly . Um , there were a couple things that were a little bit more disappointing . The biggest one is that the while it had a lot of low in grunting and grunts at low speeds . I felt like once you were at speed , the engine was a little bit underpowered . Now , again , my car has twice the power , so I know it's not a fair comparison . But if you're on the highway , say going 60 or 65 you want to overtake somebody and go up to 75 or 80 and I felt like the engine actually struggled just a little bit , really .#### #### ####[([44, 45], [51, 5], 'POS'), ([40], [61, 7, 63], 'POS'), ([5], [83], 'POS'), ([5], [7, 86], 'POS'), ([45, 21, 98], [94, 95], 'POS'), ([5], [105, 24, 107], 'POS'), ([147, 112], [5, 219, 22, 126], 'NEG'), ([142, 112], [23, 24, 146], 'POS')]
That's away from the 25 . But on these trips , we do drive these cars pretty quick , so that makes a lot of sense . We're not exactly babying him around . We want to see how dynamically they handled .#### #### ####[([13], [16, 17], 'POS'), ([13], [21, 22, 23, 24, 25], 'POS')]
Look up here . There's a carbon reef , and that helps keep the center of gravity as low as possible once again for improved road holding at the back . Look , we got the wooden wheel arches makes it look squat and purposeful . Another ren is a tiddly little boot spoiler . I don't know how much down force that is going to provide the anyway . Then we've got the M5 bunch there court tailpipes on dhe , a rear diffuser . So what you think about this car's design ? Click it there to vote .

One thing I did want to note that's actually a little bit ergonomically unpleasant about this car is the cup holder situation . You can even see . So this is more or less my eyesight . You can see how far away in the cup holders are this me extending my arm all the way ? I'm not a giant , but I'm also not a short person . The cup holders , for whatever reason , are super deep . This is me sitting full back and you can see that my hand rests , you know , on the gear lever , the way you would expect it to .

And if it could do with dropping by an extra inch , nothing that's slightly annoying . Is this like the controller for the electric door mirrors ? It's very fiddly to get up that you need small hands like Donald Trump . Another thing that's been used when you got the gear lever there , it's hard to reach the volley control for the stereo's weren't after do bit of a reach around the North . I believe I said that Well , actually , want to use that . She didn't want to tell it the volume . If you've got the upgraded Bang and Olufsen sound system , it sounds really good . Where thing is that it comes as part of a comfort pack which also includes heated seats , parking sensors , and I wouldn't put those three together rated stereo .#### #### ####[([145, 98, 62], [57, 31, 59], 'NEG'), ([104, 108, 109], [112, 113, 114], 'POS'), ([132], [131], 'POS')]

the BMW M3 . I mean , it's an absolute legend . The E 30 from the eighties really set the precedent to which this car has to live up to Canada .

And as fantastic as this is , I think the exterior is a little bit Larry the Rs three , slightly more understated .

But bizarrely , it's actually the most fun .

It's all very nice on you can get four different types of suspension , so there's normal suspension . The sport suspension there is adaptive suspension . And then there's the top of the range air suspension , which is what this car has , and for the most part it's really nice . It floats along over undulations , gives the course sophisticate feel to it . There is one thing , though , when you hit on it like an expansion gap in a motorway , a pothole or small bump . It just sent a jolt through the cards . It's really order to shock , so it's like bang . And sometimes over rough roads , you can feel it just fidgeting around . It just kind of it just breaks the ambience .

I'm not really a fun of thumb Audi say it's the first production car tow havethe Um , when I said that in the intro , I thought , I've seen another car with it . This is the first mass produced car with a camera available . The first car I remember being in production is actually a VW group car . It's the Volkswagen Excel Want . You remember that car one or something ? It waas a technological tour de force making our way to the back . You've got these lovely , smooth Audi . You're good at this Really smooth roof bars at a quite a row on the whole aargh theme continues throughout because you've got this cut in in dent down at the bottom of the doors and again with these kind of strikes , this plastic cladding . And then , while the suspension's up on its high setting , you can see all the soundproofing in here . Can you see it all ? And there's soundproofing throughout the car , all underneath the back all And if it's a flat floor cars you'd imagine on this covers up the battery pack and everything because they've tried to make it is quiet and composed and luxurious as possible , Which is why you've got the double glazed . Decide glass on the front and the back glass is optional . Double glazed . Let's go around the back , the back off the truck . Now I like the back of this . It reminds me of the Q eight , which is a really new SUV . That's the piston engine . It's got this full with led realize , and I absolutely love it at night . It's just a solid bar . It looks absolutely gorgeous again . It's no a standout car . It's actually quite subtle . If you didn't see the E Tron badge , you just think it was a fairly handsome , well put together SUV in the boot that is 660 litres of Boots place , which is really impressive . The JAG , for example , the AARP A6 650I A6 on Like the JAG . It also has a front boom fruit bigger than a lot of cars . They don't mention any of the literature Audi that this is actually a storage areas . Well , this is purely for the cables look . So will your cabling and all your clutter , which is normally under the boot floor in the Audi . And there is an under boot floor area . This is so much more useful because if you've got a boat full of stuff , if you're on a journey , you can't get your cable down . Where's here ? They're all easily accessible . You also have on the each on this false floor . Lift up the false floor in this space here for a space saver wheel , which I think will be optional when the car goes on . So there's another little bit down there . It's not quite a flat floor entry point , but it's near his damn it flat floor you can't order is a seven seater or a 62 light . You can .

Let's be honest . No , copays aren't about practicality . They drive is important . Like I said , it's beginning this video . The A5 is essentially an A4 in a different outfit on , and it has slightly stiffer suspension , and it makes it feel more sporty and also makes it feel a little bit more uncomfortable over bums . Now you can get this car with three different settings . Normal suspension or sport suspension , which is low in Stepford . Still on make the car more bouncy , or the best bear is the optional adaptive dampers , which have a comfort mo for cruising about Onda sports mode , which stiffens things up when you want to throw the car down a twisty road , and it's leading so much in the corners . This car is front wheel drive , whereas something like a bearded Z4 series or Mercedes C class on normally really drive . Now , put this into perspective for you .

He did that accessibility is the Quattro all wheel drive system , which dynamically deviates from a standard 40 60 front rear split as traction demands , sending as much as 85% of the engine power to the rear wheels . Adding to the RS5 all wheel drive excellence is a torque vectoring differential that improved agility by over driving the outside rear wheel driver's seat . That constant redirection of torque manifests itself as utterly predictable , drama free acceleration out of the corners and add to that abundant lateral grip and slightly numb but precise steering . And you have a compelling , dynamic package that welcomes drivers rather than intimidating them , which is a nice trade on unfamiliar back roads , where the high speed Benz and blind crest that defined Sears point further reassuring the driver are powerful front brakes consisting of 14.4 inch disks squeezed by A8 piston Brembo calipers .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [7, 8], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], [13, 14, 23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([56], [55], 'POS'), ([51, 69], [68], 'NEU'), ([51, 69], [75, 76], 'POS'), ([90, 91], [89], 'POS'), ([97], [93, 94], 'NEG'), ([97], [96], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [103], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [108, 109], 'POS'), ([121, 122, 123], [118, 119], 'POS'), ([20, 144], [142], 'POS'), ([20, 144, 149], [150], 'POS')]

I'm talking . Rapid charges on motorways will have battery packs attached to them , which will be constantly charging from the mains , which will give them the charges . The ability to deliver a great deal , more power in a short period . I've got this car for a few hours today . What was annoying was it wasn't full when we got it , so I've got no idea . You know , I'm not doing a kind of realistic test , but it's very obvious that , you know , when it's half full less than half full , it's saying 60 miles . So it's giving an estimate of about 122 125 miles on a charge , as a lot of regular viewers will know and people who've got these cars . Now you can get this car with a range extended option of 250 cc effectively motorbike engine that is in the back of the car that runs our generator , which can maintain your charge level as you drive along or can extend the overall range . So the overall range of this car would be with them with the range extent , it would be a realistic 160 170 miles of normal driving any time of the year . But you gotta put petrol in very small petrol tanks about four and 1/2 liters , so it's not gonna take you that far , but you can maintain the charge on just keep keep it going .

It's really shocked to drive , actually , for something .

The display is easily switched from infotainment focused driver focus with the push of a button located on the steering wheel . Nearly every action produces an almost instantaneous response from the system , while the interplay between navigation , media metadata and pertinent driving information blended together in such a harmonious way that it actually reduced her inclination towards distracted driving . Bolstering that fact is a revamped MM I interface and jester controlled touch pad , whose natural ergonomics allow for ice for use .

hello . Welcome to another episode of fully charged . This episode is all about the Mercedes to 50 e , which is the car I'm driving now , and I've driven for almost half a kilometer in it . So I'm doing that thing I often do when I get in the car and start driving it and then start talking about it . And I know nothing about it , but one of the things that is fascinating about this car that's got nothing to do with the technology or the build quality or the fact that it's purely electric car , which this one is 100% electric car . No petrol engine is not a plug in hybrid , but one of the mysterious things is that it's sort of secret . It's like Mercedes of built this electric car we don't want anyone to know on . They're not that keen . Thio Advertise it . Here's a first impression off what it's like to drive . Obviously , I'm a sucker for this stuff . Regular viewers will know . I'm easily impressed . I would kill . Call this a high end electric car . It is very nicely put together . It is very solid feeling a very easy car to get control of the visibility is fantastic .#### #### ####[([24], [100, 101], 'POS'), ([24], [196, 197, 101], 'POS'), ([205, 206], [203, 204], 'POS'), ([222], [224], 'POS'), ([205, 206], [203, 204], 'POS'), ([24], [211], 'POS')]

Despite its track ready appearance , most RS5 will spend their lives on the streets for domestic duty . Right is firm but not harsh .

Completely unnecessary in a car like this on economy falls as result of 56 mpg though the trip Computer says it's fallen even further for May at 39 miles per gallon .

there is a big difference between road testing a car and actually living with it day to day now . I think it's one of the greatest privileges that we have in this job , that we can use these cars on a daily basis and actually find out what they like to own on behind . May I think you'll agree The Mercedes SL s is one of the finest looking ownership propositions anywhere . Lester later on , athlete . But we've lived with it for five months and it goes back soon .

So let's talk about the height of the vehicle and how much that effects the maneuverability of this vehicle . So I pulled in a park and I'm down here in the park . It's a beautiful setting here . I'm down here in this park , and as I pull in , I rake the top of my van on trees . Okay , It's not a normal thing for a normal vehicle to be up that high Now . That being said , you're sitting up high . You have a huge cockpit here , you have a gigantic windshield that just gives you an awesome , awesome view of everything around you . So the visibility in this thing is super duper killer . I had an awesome drive when I drove across the country . We drove from North Carolina all the way to Utah , Wyoming , Colorado . My butt didn't hurt . My back didn't hurt . I could see really good enough . We're traveling west and the sun was going down . My face was being baked because this thing is a giant magnifying glass in the sun .#### #### ####[([5], [54, 4, 56, 6, 59, 60, 61], 'NEG'), ([94], [93], 'POS'), ([101], [100], 'POS'), ([110], [107, 107], 'POS'), ([118], [123, 124, 125], 'POS'), ([131], [107], 'POS'), ([166], [167, 168], 'POS'), ([192, 193], [100], 'POS')]

Thio drive like this , We're coming into a nice little quiet road . So I think this is probably a nice place to summarize and what it's actually like to drive the Audi R8 and sort of finish off my first ever reviewed . So this car is off as much as I've seen it and read about that . The fact that it's built for speed it's built for driving perfection is very hard to read those words or tow , watch it on a video and no actually experience . It's the only thing that I could probably say is definitely try and go out and drive a car like this .

Of course , Audi is known for its Cuatro all wheel drive system , and this A7 , along with the A6 have Audi is newest cuatro ultra , and that's an interesting system because what it does is it basically allows the car to become more fuel efficient by allowing the front wheels to do the driving now in the old front wheel drive biased all wheel drive systems . What would happen is the front wheels would lose traction . Let's say you're going around the corner and then the system would sense it and would send power to the rear wheels . And then the rear wheels would get power and immediately lose traction because they just got up and you go around the court in the back and would come flying out . That was not a great system , but Audi has thought of that . This is actually a predictive cuatro all wheel drive system . So while the front wheels do most of the driving , this car can actually predict when you're gonna need all wheel drive . So when you're going around that corner and the front will start to slip the rear wheels already engaged . But you don't get that sudden snap oversteer on snow , and instead you get the confidence of having all we'll drive even before you know you need it . At least that's what Audi claims .#### #### ####[([47, 48], [46], 'POS'), ([11], [9, 10], 'NEU'), ([11], [52, 10], 'NEU'), ([215], [222, 0, 224, 9, 10, 11], 'POS'), ([215], [139, 211, 212, 213], 'POS')]

And I like the way you can control things . Just with these touchpads is not , but it is actually touch pads there on dhe , you've still got the usual command system down there .

Like a 40 year old concept , the eye A8 doesn't look futuristic just for the sake of it . Virtually every design element serves a purpose , like this functional hood vent Ah , front apron port that creates an air curtain around the front wheels to help reduce drag .

That power is sent to the ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which we will be testing out a little bit here . But Audi claim 0 to 60 time of 4.4 seconds .

They downsized the engine , but the performance is still there . Now the rumor is coming back full circle to the beginning .

But last thing on detective splay of one dimension is when you do put the X seven in reverse , you will find a rear view camera that will come standard on every single trim level . However , there is a parking assistance package available for an additional 700 that's going to give you a surround . You monitor with three D technology and parking assistant plus , where parallel parks itself , but definitely helps you out with visibility when it comes to putting it in reverse there . But as always , that is going to leave me in the safety net . So to start , there are front side inside curtain airbags in the back . There is latch , a K A . Lower anchors and temperature children for the rear car seats . Also standard frontal collision warning with sitting collision mitigation lane departure warning , blind spot detection with three across traffic alert and I also wanted to mention an off road package , and this goes for $1650 . But I put this in safety because you never know when you're going to go on some gravel roads or back roads or something . That or snow Where you might need this Because this is going to give you a mechanical differential lock and some off road driving modes , including sand , rock , gravel and snow .

And to be honest with you , it's It's a very , very good car , although starting off with it's got an engine , which is about 1.5 liter three cylinder turbo charge . And because of that , if you totally underpowered sometimes because let it when you are about to overtake someone or unique power instantly , it takes a while before trouble charge kicks in . But the power delivery is free , linear , and because the car is , it's quite heavy . So the engine means very small , which is , by the way , from a Mini Cooper . Yes , the mini Cooper engine , which has been captured and put into this . So yeah , that's basically the reason why this car feels a little under former .

It's ah , the telemetry for the motor . It's a horsepower and torque and then you also have a G meter you can put up . And if you get the dynamic package , which comes with ceramic brakes , you'll get direct tire pressure monitoring and then it will bring up a display that ah tells you individual pressure and temperature of each tire , which is very important because we have this kind of power . You want to know that your tires upto temperature where you start pushing the car and obviously you can configure that it's Blake and show me how so . Um , let's go lay out so you can switch from the sport layout to the classic layout . And this is what you'd expect in a normal car just to pages .

Business goes really fast on because this is no this sort of softer version of an AMG in the way that Jackie Reptile or fortunately liberties compared to Cooper doesn't feel to me .

Keeps him started A8 First thing I should point out about this . Audi Q3 is the on driving the S line version that has lowered stiffened suspension and it is quite firm over bumps , but a bit like an orthopedic mattress . It's not uncomfortable . It's all right . You can't d selected and have the normal suspension off the sport model , which is a bit softer and it might be worth doing , actually , alternatively , can pay extra and get deductive suspensions at a press of a button . You could put it into comfort mode . It's really comfy or president button when he goes into sports mode , and then it's stiff from firmer . The steering is really good . The way is not to sensitivity , just turning a bit . But then the more you turn it , the Maur responsive , insensitive it becomes . Which means you could get from full look the full lock in just two turns of the wheel . So it's dead easy to maneuver around town . That means it's not too flighty when you don't want it to bay yet is responsive when you do , you want it to be , which is great . Was not so great , though , is the automatic gearbox . In fact , if I stop the car , so let's say we're a junction or around about not certainly need to get that Gap floored it . Fraud it . Now it's going . It's really unresponsive . This gearbox .

You can control the lights , the interior lighting and one of the interesting , um , features we have in the back seat . We saw these matrix reading lights . Normally , you get in a car and reading light is just push you on and off of a button . And it's just pointed out , and you have to move your book or your magazine that you're reading in the back seat . You have to move it to where the light is pointing well with the With this new generation , we've created the , um , the matrix , rear reading lights and what you can do back here . Did you go in the individual and you can set the different size of a light ? It'll give you the spotlight on the remote . You can move the light around where you want , so you better where you're basically what's happening because I'm doing the left side . You're nice idea . So basically what's happening up there is . This is the same philosophies are front matrix beam headlights . There are no motors moving . We have seven different nodes of of led light back here . And as you move the light around where you want it to be on the remote , different lights light up because each of those different nodes in the headliner has a different brightness , and it's aimed a different place as interesting a book here I could I could bet on my hand I could move it over here , basically pointed to wherever it is that that's the same as the headlights .#### #### ####[([13, 14], [8, 2, 10], 'POS'), ([10], [1, 2], 'POS'), ([10], [21, 22], 'POS'), ([13, 57], [49, 50, 51, 52, 53], 'NEG'), ([45], [77], 'POS'), ([141], [8, 2], 'POS'), ([119], [146, 147, 7, 151], 'POS'), ([119], [155], 'POS'), ([174, 64, 10], [176], 'POS'), ([176, 10], [228, 229], 'POS'), ([119], [146, 263], 'POS'), ([119], [271], 'POS'), ([271, 280], [278], 'POS'), ([77], [431, 432, 2], 'POS'), ([176, 480], [260], 'POS'), ([516, 200], [515], 'POS'), ([516, 200], [260], 'POS'), ([516, 200], [146, 234, 278, 615], 'POS'), ([516, 200], [146, 550, 634], 'POS'), ([516, 200], [228, 656], 'POS'), ([80, 675], [515, 674], 'NEU')]

Winding mountain roads The TT does virtually everything you ask of it . Everything . No , not everything . With Cuatro Well , driving a light , nimble package like this fits the teaching into a corner . Leave about 20 to 30% throttle on , and grip quickly becomes a non issue , along with almost perfectly centered driving position . The steering response , actually just the physical shape of the steering wheel really elevate the Audi TT above rivals like the BMW , Z4 and Mercedes-Benz SLK . In fact , one of the best qualities of this staring is that the ratio was so tight that you can turn the wheel from lock to lock in two rotations . The turning radius is also tight . Despite the quick steering ratio ride , quality slips between the softer BMW , Z4 and Mercedes-Benz S L C and slightly more aggressive Porsche , Boxter and Cayman .

Now this sloping roof line , it does mean that this car doesn't have quite such a wide open in the back seats as the X3 police out of here , actually , so that can make it a little bit trickier when you're gonna maneuver all those really big rearward facing child seats .

Well , I'm okay , look , but it is pretty tight . People over 64 may find it a touch cramped back here . It's made worse if you have three in the back at once .

All models come with Cuatro war will drive , yet you know it does all that it needs to . It's comfortable as well . So I do have a word of warning . You see , this particular model is yes , light . It's got lowered , stiffened suspension on it , perhaps rides a little bit too firmly . But if you ask your dealer to go with the normal suspension , yeah , goes over very , very well .

Speaking of stories , let's move on to the boot and see what that's like . So the capacity is actually pretty good for a sporty car such as this . If you have a look inside , you'll see there's plenty of space there because this one hasn't got to spare . Well , there is a more storage into there if you need it now , I've got to fit this pack . It is regretting doing that now that it's all right . So , yeah , the boot is pretty large . However , you have to be careful what you take if you wanna put the roof down at any point , because when you put the roof down , you have to make sure that everything fits under this cover because the roof mechanism goes on top of that there .

We've also made a couple of minor modifications to the gearshift . It's got a short shift kit on it now , so it's a much more direct , much tighter gear change . The standard car can be quite wallow we quite vague . This is lovely and tight . This car's also got a clutch pedal modification , which makes the pedal itself heavier . That's really lovely on a quick drive like this one , but when you're in traffic driving through town , it just feels a bit heavy , a bit unnecessarily heavy on the differential . So it's a quite if limited slip differential . It makes a huge difference . That's a massive improvement over the standard cost . The standard car , as it comes from the factory , didn't have an air less dear just hadn't opened death . Now the problem with that is that because even the standard car's got loss of power . When you get on the power away from a corner , particularly if you've got the traction on the stability control off . All that happens is the inside rear tire just lights up now with this quite LSD , when he gets on the power away from a corner that this bites and it sends the drive to both wheels . And so you get much better traction for one thing , much better drive away from the corner . But also , if you stand on the power really hard on both wheels , start spinning up . You know the car is going to slide , and then it's very controllable , is progressive and you simply Jews size of the slide with your right foot overall . Having that def in there just makes the car march or satisfying to drive , less frustrating on more controllable . It's a really good upgrade . The space is on the front axle . Just quite little 10 mil spaces on the front axle just wide in the track with a little bit make a good difference to the steering . It feels more positive now . Finally , this suspension biggest upgrade . We've made this car the first grade that we made as well . Spring rates have actually gone up slightly , about 10% but What they've done is taking a lot of rebound damping out off the dampers . Their rebound is the speed of which that wheel can drop out of the arch , having bean shoved up there by a bump or by the car leaning over an event . So we've got more spring right , and that does mean that particularly low speed and on a bumpy road there's a little bit of edge to the ride quality . That's true . But by taking out that rebound dumping , what you're allowing each wheel to do is to roll through potholes , roll through sunken drink covers rather than crashing through them , and that really improves comfort . But this car isn't about a limo like ride quality Overy cushion right quality . It's also know about being super stiff on super hard for the track . It's fast road set up , ready on . Where really starts to work beautifully is on a bumpy road when you're driving at speed . That's when you feel how brilliantly the suspension is working . The body is kept well controlled . Certainly much better control than the standard suspension did understand . A suspension . The body would float around the rear ends with corkscrew . It would get loose over undulations and compressions , and you have no confidence in it . Now the body is much better controlled . You also feel how well the suspension is working to keep each time pressed into the road . Only when the tire is pressed into the road can generate any grip . So what you find is that you've got much better body control . You've got more consistent grip , and as a result , you've just got more confidence .#### #### ####[([10, 7], [6], 'NEU')]

So basically the A3 has no choice but to be absolutely outstanding , and the good news is that actually , it is quite a step forward . In particular , the ride seems to be a lot more pliant here .

And I'm sure that is the same for the pure petrol version of this or the pure diesel version . I don't even know what BMW do with these cars .

I don't even know that I'm not interested because those cars are boring . And this car is just on the edge , just on the cusp of boring Andi . Quite interesting . So this car has 249 brake horsepower and can do 0 to 60 in 6.1 seconds , apparently . Okay , so I'm going to do I just put it in sport mode . I'm going to do it a naught to 60 cause you have to . It's really , really important how fast the car goes . You're not 16 straight road . Actually , there's nothing behind me are in front of me here . We g o 123 okay ? Yes , it's very swift .

Let's first of all talk about the driver's display . It's a standard on the X5 on . You can do different things like See the satnav , innit ? Go through various items . Anything I don't really like right ? So much is that the Rev . Counter runs backwards , like on a Persian , which is a bit odd , but it doesn't mean they can free up in the space in between the dollars to fit the SAT nav map there at all times . If you want it the main entertainment screen . It's really good , really clear . The image on it is , though . Someone's actually painted it on . The graphics are that sharp , and you can operate in lots of different ways . He can use a swivel wheel like that . You can use things like gesture control . So that is to do the volume that is to change track . There we go to registering it here , but actually those gestures a bit of a gimmick . The metal . Just use the buttons on the steering wheel on the swivel world . Or , of course , the touch screen if you want to . But the latest in for this new entertainment system is intuitive voice commands . He can just talked it normally . Just have to wake it up by gay Hey , BMW , take me to car . Why , it's actually taking me to Carlisle . You just lose some points there . BMW afraid Well , so doesn't cope too well with middle index , but I kind of get the idea , the actual entertainment system itself if you just use it normally like , would I drive very easy to use . You can just spin through the menu's just on the left hand side . The satnav looks really good and generates okay , there . Anything like found with a certain of is that it's not the smartest . Sometimes it just wants to stick you on the main route . Even there , like back routes , will be quicker .

There we go Now . If you check out the space , you'll see there's loads of it . I want to share the pulse of cover cause Handley .

Technology doesn't end there , though . There some to take the strain out of long motorway journeys such as the steering and lane controlled assistant . So one of the things it can do is read the lines in the road , and it will actively steer the car to keep it within the lines . Now you're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel , and if you take , the market will probably give you about 10 15 seconds of driving that you hands on the wheel before it will warn you , and then it will shut down the system . But I've noticed that if you just rest of me on the steering wheel , it pretty much thinks your hands on it . I will just continue working . So I'm just driving along on the autobahn , cruising at 100 kilometers an hour . The car's doing everything for me . It's steering . I've got the active cruise control on , so it's keeping my speed , and it's using radar to measure to the car in front . So now the conference is breaking . This car is breaking automatically . It also reads a speed signs on I Got My Cruise Control set 100 read that sign , and then it suggests that I might want to change my setting on the cruise control and at the touch of a button , I can reset my top speed again as that new speed limit . So it's all that easy . You can just sit back , relax and the car do everything for you . Yeah , Andi , stay within the law . Maybe I should drive a lot just to be a responsible person . But what about if you want to do the driving yourself ?#### #### ####[([166, 167], [260], 'POS')]

It's open now , since we are round back when it comes to that rear lift gate , it is a power lift gate .

There , you pop it into the MGM , which is a kind of half off mode . It just allows a little bit more slip before it gets involved .

Speaking of which , what is the A6 like when you hit the road when you bite in Audi A6 .

It makes it kind of fidgety and a bit jarring , so you got two options . What you can do is pay a lot of money and have the optional air suspension , which is good .

You might be thinking , I don't need that , actually . But believe me , you do , because without the car just doesn't drive as well as it should . So you got sports mode , so it's all hunkered down and taught .

A car that's both bone . If only the steering was quite as nice as it is in a Jackie Rexy , R8 will be the full package . Another option you might want to consider is the automatic gearbox . Because it's brilliant . Bend of these autos are among the best , if not the best in the business . I can't say the same for the manuals they didn't know come with rev matching for smooth down ships .

Fixed to this homed in tone sheet metal is a lighter , more rigid chassis that allows for some brilliant suspension Tuning . Conventional wisdom would suggest that a true luxury sedan must sacrifice a measure of handling performance in the name of comfort .

It's certainly fast on . I've got the DFC switched off just to see how poised how Rhea driven this thing can feel when it wants to . So let's see . Second Gear Corner , I guess around . Yeah , I mean , we know this that way . We know four wheel Drive is nothing to be worried about when it comes to the balance handling balance with four Door Saloon these days we have seen evidence of this a lot recently , but normally we see in proper M cars where you can just turn off the front drive shafts completely . Orin Mercedes-Benz G's you know , proper upper level performance sports . That's not what this is . This is kind of the top of the normal range three series , and technically , I haven't really done anything to the four wheel drive system . It's just being just being itself . It just being A3 series for your sister being pretty adjustable , isn't it ? It's sort of a step on from active . A4 will drive systems that we've known , so you could just get a bit more attitude in the car . Use a bit more opposite . Look before the drive line , start shuffling , talk forwards again and put in the car out . This life , it just feels more Red River natural cornering balance of a car is really good as well .

Now let's talk about this entertainment system because A8 serious gets the latest version of BMW's I drive so you can operate it by touching it . You can use voice commands by going , Hey , BMW , what's the time ? It is 14 58 . You can also control it by gesture . So , yeah , if I do that , come on . There we go . I can wave my hand about and control certain things on dhe . I do use it for the volume . Onda , like Hey , can skip trucks by going on . That's it . Recognizing my jester , that's quite good fun . It's nice to use on some way . He seems a bit more intuitive than actually pressing a button on the steering wheel to do it . There are more functions than in previous BMWs , but it's not too confusing the hell out the many , just as you want it as it's customizable . If you want , you can use the old fashioned swivel well , which is actually pretty good when you're driving along . It's nice and easy to operate , and you could just wait three different menus and just activate different things . So it's good . They've retained that unlike Audi , which has got rid of this with the world control and just come fully touch screen , which isn't such a good idea . You can use the entertainment system to control all the cards major functions and can do things like or to the color of the interior ambient lighting , which is standard on this car . There's not too many colors to choose from , but there's enough . You gotta think about Blue Green , but I think it just looks better with orange to match the exterior paint . It's pretty cool . Also have various online app , so you can do things like check the weather or the news . And there's even a concierge service where you can contact someone at BMW for help with the car or taxi program . You're certain of remotely instead , simple . My only major real problem with this entertainment system is the fact that when you have Apple carplay , there is no android auto , so I can't connect my phone to it , and I'd like to . Still , the screen is very sharp . The graphics look good on the map is really responsive when you try and move it around . Now let's move on to the digital drivers display , which I don't think it's quite a successful as those in an Audi or a Mercedes so part . The reason is that it's all quite dark . It doesn't quite the functionality , either . You get in the other German cars as well , so you can choose different views . And things are . But it's not quite extensive . Also , not a big fan of the rev counter game backwards . Now they've done that so that the freedom space in the middle for the satnav , unfortunately , is no that clear . One thing I will point out , though , is I like the fact they have the little graphic of the car , and it showed in the color that you have the car , which is a nice touch . The specifications on this car is really , really good as standard in the UK we get there sport version , which has a ll the kit you really need . Finally , let's talk about the cubby spaces because they do matter if you're gonna be in a grand tour . A crossing continents . So the door bins along , but not really very wide . So I could just about squeeze that intuit . The glove box is so safe the manual does take of a bit of space beacon away . Really , because you have the manual installed on the court entertainment system . So just use that one instead . Under here , you do have quite a bit of space , and you've got your USB C . Now , what is that ? Your species socket there to plug in . The mobile device is also under here . You have a normal USB socket so you can plug in your phone system there as well . And there's a little pad there for Wallace charging for your mobile phone or to charge the cause . Kay , you got a couple of cup holders here . Why ? Any problem in the Cup holders is that this part of the cover just hangs over the top of its gonna be careful not to catch your coffee cup when you're lifting , acting much , spill it everywhere .

It just takes off . And before you know , you have to put your foot on the brake just to solve . Calm yourself down because this car is really fast on the paddles . This car is really , really good .

If you look at it , it's very similar to a cell phone . You basically have icons that could be swiped back and forth that can be touched . And because Audi believes that it's much easier toe control information through this touch screen , there's a haptic interface , so when you push the button , it gently pushes back against your finger , giving you the sense that you've done something . Now , is this a better system ? You know , I'm looking at all different functionality just in these two screens . I'm looking probably at 50 different functions . Plus , they're all the functionality over here . You know , if you own this car , I suspect you probably gonna have to bust out the owner's manual to really get very well acquainted with this because there's a lot of tech here . But I do love the fact that you've got Google Earth that could be now displayed on the main screen . You've got ways that could be displayed over here . And you've got about 1000 different ways that you can customize this car or 400 different ways . And you can set presets to customize these screens . Is it too much ? Techwood ? Depends how much you like this . If you like this , then this will probably become very intuitive . And best of all , there's also wireless charging . You can put your phone right here , close at the phone automatically charges . Plus , it syncs up wirelessly with Audi is latest version of its MM , my system and you are all good to go .

There is no question that there is a lot of tank in the new C cast , possibly a bit too much down here .

Most modern cars the X1 can be customized be a multiple drive modes , including a sport mode with quicker throttle response and heavier steering and a comfort mode that pretty much does the opposite .

Now I've got different driving modes , which is of course , now common thing . So I've got comfort auto dynamic individual , so I'm gonna go into dynamic and once again that changes a throttle response and changes shift points . It changes how plan of this car feels and dynamic voted , feels very planet . But don't get me wrong . This is a big car . It drives big . You could feel this car's half left incisors . You're pushing it around these quarters . And while it's not perfectly neutral with something that tends to happen with , oh , well , drive cars , it is never less confidence inducing Elektronik steering . Yeah , it's still a little not communicate inside . I tell what the front wheels were doing . That really doesn't matter . Most people , probably that overall , Even though this is A7 and it's kind of this 44 door hatchback coupe , it's still more of a GT car than a canyon carving car .

That's for engines . Well , they're all strong performers . If you want petrol power , just go for the 5 to 8 I because it's got plenty performance on dhe . It's reasonably economical for a petrol . But if it is economy you want you need on the two liter diesels and it's best in the 5 20 d because it can go from 0 to 60 in under eight seconds and still return around 65 miles per gallon . On edge in this car is the storming really to diesel gives you decent economy and stellar performance . So not 60 takes under six seconds . You have been to be says it'll return around 54 miles per gallon . They come to district computer . I'm doing around 37 mpg . On the whole , the engine is really good . When you're cruising but when you put your foot down , it's just a little bit more noisy in the diesel engines you get in an Audi A6 . Also , I don't think the manual gearbox you get on the four cylinder BMW A5 service is as nice as the man you get on the Audi once again .

One option you may want , though , is adjustable lumbar support for your back because it doesn't come a standard , which is a little bit odd , because this kind of price especially get things like electric steering column . There is absolutely loads of adjustment in it . In fact , this new G class is actually longer , wider and taller than the old one . It means there's loads more space here in the front , and even if you're small , you can really jack up the seat to get good view out . There's still plenty of head room , if you really told you can go lower . But what's it like in the back ? Because the old Carl was absolutely terrible ? Well , one thing I will point out is the fact the rear doors don't open all that wise . It can be a bit . Or could any first light training maneuver charts see ? And thankfully , though , the eyes are fixed points of really easy to get out there exposed , that's no problem . It's more of a problem . Once again , he's getting it right . As you can see , though , once you're in Oh my gosh , loads of head room . You could be well over six foot tall . You'll be fine . Knee room is decent as well . Now you can stretch your feet out some way , but then there's like a thing underneath the front seat that you can't go any further . So that's it . It's not fully like a limousine in the back , but it's comfy enough on . I can't complain about this . Look . Huge rear windows . The ledge is low , so kids were built to say very easily . Also , there's big windows just behind you , which helped make it feel like near in here . Despite all the black trim of this particular car , makes you think that this is gonna be a seven seater . But no , it's not . It's a strict five seater . Now , if you want to carry five once , it's doable because his car is so wide . Yes , the middle seat is a little bit harder and raised up in the outer , too . But the floor's pretty flat . There's loads of room for everyone's feet . You can carry three people in the back here , no problem at all .

It's also predictive . So , whereas in the old A 45 it would only shunt drive real words when the front axle slipped . Now it can predict that moment of slip and send Dr Rhee words before the front axle loses traction . These are quite important changes because certainly the way the former drive system worked in the old A 45 was one of the frustrations we have with that car . The other one was that the chassis , the suspension was so rigid , so it felt crash she over a bumpy road , and on UK roads , that meant that it was compromised now that a 45 was spectacularly fast 370Z six horsepower bundles of grip , loss of body control . But strangely , it just wasn't that engaging to drive something like a rent a sport .

We've got some nice turns and the brilliant thing about cars . Obviously it's built for speed cornering and just just hugs the corners like it's not even trying . Which is probably the best thing about driving a car that's so low to the ground has such fat ties so much power driving the box Astro . The tires are probably half the week , so when you're going around the corner like you feel like you're gonna topple over like a bus or something like that .

cool . With great power comes great responsibility . First of all , what movie of my quoting leave a comment below the video . And secondly , that's exactly how I feel . Sitting behind the wheel of the 2012 BMW 6 50 i with the M Sports package Hagan this Dave Erickson for TfL car dot com Now , in the vein of full disclosure , I must tell you I'm a huge BMW fan . I bought my 1st 3 28 i as a gift to myself after a job promotion about 14 years ago . Ever since I've been in love with the BMW , so driving a 6 50 I this week has been a big treat for me . With all that said , the challenge in this review , it's not only finding the good , which there are plenty but finding the bad .#### #### ####[([41], [74, 76], 'POS'), ([41], [104], 'POS'), ([56], [146, 141], 'POS')]

Well , let's find out . Let's go for a ride together and see how this car differs from the previous generation . I can immediately tell you that it feels and drives a lot bigger . This car , like almost every German car , is one size bigger than used to be . Think of the three Siri's now the to Siri's slots . Underneath the same thing with this . This is more of , Ah , almost e class size car than a C Class . But that's okay because , well , obviously , this does compete with A3 Siri's . They're very different cars . A3 Siri's . That's the sporty one , right ? That's the one that you want to go tear up a track with this . This has always been the more luxurious one , and that theme continues in this model . Besides being lighter , this new C class is also bigger .#### #### ####[([30], [9, 34, 35], 'NEU'), ([32], [9, 34, 35], 'NEU'), ([147], [75, 142, 47], 'POS'), ([48], [35], 'NEU')]
But it's a good one . Come out to chassis and suspension has a bit more of a departure to report there . So , yes , the car is bigger in the last three , Siri's got longer wheelbase , but the front track has actually grown in greater proportion and beyond all that you've got , stiffer springs is different . The roll bars stiffer mountings , more negative camber on the front axle , and all of that's going on below a body structure that's 25% more rigid than the last three . Siri's . That's what gives BMW permission to stick up the chassis rights without compromising the right . Hopefully , the really an innovative thing in the chassis , or what BMW calls lift related dampers now , then adaptive dampers and such . But they do have little individual structures within the reservoirs that actually provide Maur damn possible at the extremes of the travel . So A4 compression but full rebound dampers just work a little bit hard , harder for the car , and that allows them to perhaps be a little bit more laid back in fluent right in the middle of travel on that provides more ride comfort theory anyway , you don't want knows . You could have shorter , firmer M6 port suspension springs , which also come with firmer anti roll bars yet more negative camber for those front wheels on variable sport steering and then beyond that . If you want to go even further , you can have adaptive M6 suspension with proper adaptive dampers . DVD , although by and large A3 Siri's by don't tend to go quite that far , which intrigues me , nothing BMW done it so spaced out . The ratios in the eight speed automatic gearbox in the car gets so the shorter ones , the level ones a shorter the high ones are taller and at times . Maybe when you're using manual mode , sometimes you feel like you're in the wrong gear . You know your gear higher , then you expect to be on the computer . But weird sometimes when you just sort of tooling around town and like fourth and fifth .#### #### ####[([28], [30], 'POS'), ([39], [38], 'POS'), ([43, 44], [49, 50], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [58], 'NEU'), ([83, 85, 86], [88, 15, 90], 'NEU')]

Another thing is that while the visibility at the front and the back is actually very good is easy to place the car .

All right , I'm being completely honest . 315 horsepower on £330 feet of torque is just adequate for this car .

As for the time , let's see , that's 4.6 seconds . Not bad , considering the track . It's slippery on . The C 63 has a tendency to light up the tires , so this engine produces 700 new two meters of torque . And put that into perspective for you . That's more pulling power than you get from a Ferrari F 12 . And the best thing is is that it's available from under 2000 rpm . So you put your foot down .

Everything that's annoying is this . Look , it's really , really hard to remove the ISA fix covers . Yeah , and once you remove him , you might just lose them . Chelsea is all right in the back .

Well , right , we'll start in the 3 20 shall we ? That's the important one . After all , there's a few technicalities to cover before we crack on the force , and the engine in this car is new . Instead of using twins , girl turbochargers like the last one uses to sequential turbochargers a big one on the little one , and it makes the same peak . Power and pick talk is the last two litre did G20 day , but it's alleged to be more efficient on more responsive A3 . 20 D Peak power is 100 and 87 horsepower picked or is £295 foot . You can have two litre turbo petrol power in the 255 4th power 3 30 i or a three litre turbo straight six engine , either the 3 30 d or in the M3 40 . Only that I'll be driving on track like , you know , given it's only a four cylinder diesel , the engines pretty strong . It's a 400 diesel , so it's always gonna be more about talking power . It's never gonna sound that great way , know that , but judge by the right standards , it actually robes really cleanly pretty much all the way to the red line of 4000 right ? Um , really nice , broad spread of talk . You can sort of tell that maybe BMW hasn't got the refinement measures in this car that it puts in the biggest leans A5 siris because the engine sounds a little bit gruff at times when you work it when you rev it , yet you can tell it's a four cylinder diesel . It's not the most refined engine off its kind , but then BMWs have never been outstanding in that respect . It's fine .

It has an official stated range of a run over by a 120 miles . The lovely man who's let me this car , Andy said he thinks 85 to 90 years of realistic like every day , driving range in rain in the cold and wet with pills , which seems very , very plausible . But here's one of the things that I know will garner some comments and some annoyance because it is a brilliant car . It has no rapid charge ability , so this car could be charged on a 13 and plug you have in your kitchen . Or it can use a wall mounted car charger , but only up to 60 nap . So it's only a three kilowatt charger , a three killer or five charges , so it takes at the minimum 4 to 5 hours to charge it . So if you're going to stop it , a motorway service is plug it into a rapid charger . The only charge you can use is the really slow one . So you're gonna be waiting three or four hours toe . Add 18 90% to the battery . Which is which means it's just crazy on what Andy , the owner of this car said , is that he just doesn't He's not gonna go on long journeys in it . He can't because he can't be bothered to wait that long to recharge the car . That is a really I'd say that was a really drawback of this vehicle because everything else about it is really nice , and it's really hard to know his . I think his reasoning is quite , quite sensible , why they didn't put a rapid charge socket on it . And that is because the cut this car you can also get is a diesel version or a petrol version .#### #### ####[([22], [77], 'POS'), ([84], [177, 178, 59], 'NEG')]

Speaking of Dry Train , What I hope is gonna come next is potentially an upgraded gearbox now , when the car launched and I've always been somewhat of a gearbox snob . But from a practical car point of you have been able to live with the fact that this isn't a jewel clutch gearbox , even though it's incredibly quick . Most of the time , I'm not grabbing it by the scruff of its neck and driving in 20th . I am using it as a daily practical driver , but it is wonderful to have that power on the braking performance when you needed this one . It was optioned with the optional carbon ceramic brakes . But things have evolved and twin clutch gearbox is becoming more commonplace in high performance cars . And this is why I want to draw parallels between the Panamera sport charisma from essentially the same group that runs a fantastic Jule clutch gearbox . In fact , the best gay box in the world as far as I'm concerned is the portal Pini K . It is an audible tone . Change off cog maneuvers . Honestly , it's It's so Seaver's is so fantastic . When I drove this car last on this channel , back to back with the Panamera Sport charisma , that was one off the things which was highlighted . The most waas sophistication leap off the Porsche gearbox over this . This is a conventional A8 speed talk converter box , generally okay , but when you're really on it , particularly under heavy braking and downshifting , it's not always there for you .

One thing that does surprise me about this car is really is quiet , but it doesn't seem quite as quiet when traveling at speed as an Audi A7 . You just get a bit more noise from the tires on dhe .

Let's finally move on to the Audi Dr selected that you get within the Audi A one and this is something that I really wasn't expecting from this car because it is the base level . Smallest little Audi . They still put their drive selected on both A3 systems , but it doesn't make sense . All three systems make a huge difference to the card . I just wasn't expecting so efficiency mode basically cuts the engine . If you're coasting , it changes gear early . It probably uses less than the engine , meaning you get better mpg . So for the long distances , this car is perfect , and I have mentioned previously in this video that I do use it around town . Quiet , however , coming up to a junction coasting into a junction , which I do quite off it cuts the power on DDE has a little think about whether it wants to turn back on or not . So the only down side are saying to this car is blinis inefficiency mode . Driving into a junction , for example , you're cruising into a roundabout , and you're looking to the right to see if any cars coming . No cars are coming . The engine's already cut off , so you have to put your foot on the accelerator for a couple of seconds before it realizes that you want to engage the engine again , and that's when you get the power back . So there has been a few times that I've sort of being caught in limbo all around about gun . Where's the calyx ? The efficiency mode is very , very good , but I would probably stick to using it on long journeys soon . Did you pick into dynamic , which I have been doing already ?

Now , though , it's time to hit the rail to see what the G . L . A is like to drive now . Like I said at the beginning , this review the G L . A .

That matters a lot because the A class is a little bit too for riding . I think so , as you move up the range , you do get sported suspension , which is firmer on bigger wheels , and that does start to impair the right quality somewhat . So just be aware of that on . There's not really a trade off in terms of handling the sport . Your card . While the supposedly sporting guards they don't really go around corners any better part .

Now here's something that's very unique to BMW . It used to be there when you want , open the hood or the bonnet , as you Brits like to say , you would pull this lever and it would open . But not anymore . You have to pull it twice , which does all the magic for you , which means that you no longer have to reach underneath for the little hood latch so that you can get at this BMW two litre turbo charged engine , which puts out 240 horsepower .#### #### ####[([18, 19, 23], [4, 5], 'POS')]

Though there is one compromise . The X3 is Booth is about 42 smaller than the normal A3 is because of the Quattro or will dry system has rear differential , which goes underneath the boot floor , and it means that you don't have extra under floor stories like you would do in a normal car . Still , a slightly smaller boot is a small price to pay for all that extra boot you get from the engine . So really no .

Now the first thing that grabs you is the tech the Audi has chucked at this car , so I've got a huge entertainment display here . The graphics chip on it is super fast as well . You can connect to the Internet , you can have Google maps , and it's a ll very , very slick . This one's also got the virtual cockpit , so digital drivers display Aiken cycle through different screens , have the na'vi there as well to the size of the dolls it's all absolutely lovely , but Audi being Audi , you have to pay for it . So as standard , the car actually comes with a smaller screen with a slightly slower process .

Well , all about his engines . A really impressive I'm gonna keep it nice and simple for you . If you don't do that many miles , get the 1.4 liter turbo petrol . If you do lots of miles , get the two litre diesel in 190 horsepower guys , which is what this car has . The reason is that it's nice and sporty feels pretty quick on DDE . It actually gives really good economy . So Audi says it'll do 67 miles per gallon on in my hands .

But its handling wise , as much as the steering wheel is quite heavy . It gives you that sense of being connected to the road and actually being in control of the car .

If you compare it to a N E V equivalent , it's actually 30 centimeters shorter than a Tesla Model X , or 13 centimeters longer than a jag I pace . But let's talk about the design for a second . This is the bill I enjoy . I think it's a pretty looking car . Actually , I think it's a better looking car in the Tesla Model X are probably prefer , probably prefer the JAG I paid for being a little bit more creative . However , you can't lose sight of the fact that Audi wants to get people out of piston cars and into Evie's . And if it looks familiar and it has that class and grace about it , which it does , then that's a good thing , if that's what you set out to achieve . But the front he got a grill , which is that familiar kind of trapper Sordell shape is Audi calls it , which is the same throughout the Audi family .

Now it's covered with the practicality at the boat . So yeah , a lot the way you open it by flipping up the badge . And the capacity is ever so slightly smaller than that you get with the Audi A7 . It doesn't matter because it's still quite large . The biggest difference , though , is that this car has a saloon boot , a CZ . The Audi has a lift back . Tailgate hatchbacks is a bit more practical and easy to load larger items , though it's not too much of a hardship . This is more like a saloon car . There is a matter of practicality , like vote for these levers . I can't fall down the rear seats .

You know , style is a very subjective thing . I think we can all agree that some cars are just butt ugly . I'm talking about the Pontiac ass . Heck , and perhaps some cars . Air just dropped that . Gorgeous . Maybe the new Range Rover Ovelar . Now , to me , the Audi , at least from the front , is classic Audi . Look at the nose . It's intersecting lines , a lot of angles . It's very sharp , very modern , but we move on to the back . Things changed quite a bit . It almost feels like two different designers did the front in the back of the car .

It's a testament to the C Class is 1.8 litre direct injection turbocharged engine that I didn't initially ? No , it was a four cylinder . I mean , really paid attention . I probably have noticed that there's a little extra buzz coming through the steering wheel , but there's enough power that you don't really think .

But so now , since we all around back first , I want to mention there is a power liftgate that will come standard back there so you can simply use the button on the key five . But if you like , it's all power eyes , even the bottom section . You just press one button walk away , and then it goes down and up for yourself . That is definitely convenient , but once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna commit 33.9 cubic feet . If that was not enough space for you . Simply fold that second road down , which is done by simply just hitting one lever there . But once that second row is folded down , that bumps the cubic feet nus up the 72.3 Sogo bit of space there . And then , if you still needed more space , there actually is under floor storage back there and quite a bit of it as well .

All right , 0 to 60 with the X5 . With the sport and performance package now appeared a mile above sea level , we have less air density , which means there's less air for the engine , which means the car's air slower .

And all of what is on that digital gauge set up can be controlled by using the steering wheel mounted controls on the left side there . But it's gonna give you things like the cars , information , Bluetooth , information , radio settings , navigation . Really , the navigation is the best part because there is a view button on the steering wheel there . If you press that , you can toggle between a full navigation set up across all of the gauges or just a small one in the left corner There with the tachometer being front and center .

Hopefully , the way the new X5 drives is enough to make up for this mold and winds , so the X 50 d has its own unique suspension set up . It's got coil springs with adaptive dampers . Andi . They are set up a little bit firmer than the other . Cars are getting comfort mode in the moment , and it does feel very , very comfortable . It's gonna hiding out . Bums doesn't jump around too much . Just went over there . I could hardly feel it . Press this button put into sport , and then it adds weight to the steering improves the throttle response . It's different at the suspension . On it adds a bit of a fruit stand exhaust . You know what A8 in sport , the Roy doesn't seem really much worse . It's very , very good . This one actually has the active anti roll bars proper with side , which would normally lean down to stop the car rolling so much in the corners . And it does . It feels really sporting agile you at the same time , really strong , sturdy on a bit of a beast . Taxi drive . It's great . I think they've got it spot on . They have blended comfort with performance brilliantly . With this car , steering is a highlight . If you compare this thing like an Audi cue aides , which has doing this a little bit kind of dead . This does feel like it's connected to the front wheels onto the road so you can tell what's going on . One thing I will complain about those that change modes . You have to ridge between the two front seats on feely , away to the buttons . They end up looking down . When you want to go in sport , when really you want to look at the road , not down here .

S8 really is a proper wolf in sheep's clothing because while you go about performance for most of the time you're just cruising along its release today , it's as comfy as a big woolly jumper , so this car has the adaptive dampers .

Now , the way Audi he's done that has got this four litre V8 twin turbo charged diesel engine . It's got sequential turbo , so one gets going early than an exhaust valve opens . A certain reds on the other Turbo kicks into , but from low revs . It has an electrically operated compressor , no electric turbocharger because it because it's not doing what it does . But it's doing compressing . It's chucking in the air because it's electric and it spins up very quickly from north to 70,000 rpm mean 1/4 of a second . I believe that means there is almost no Audi says , almost no turbo lag . Well , quite shocking the gearbox across into manual mode and leave it there and then go from very low ribs . I put my foot down . There is acceleration in a manner that you just don't get in a turbocharged car . Turbo charges just spit back quickly in response to throw numbers . They just don't do it . Was it 48 votes ? Well , to get enough power , so you're gonna have to increase The current switch . Can't do because you love with massively thick cables . Or you have to increase the voltage , which you could do by families . There's a four liter V eight engine in the front , so if you want to generate some power , you can so as well as the normal 12 of battery . This car also has a 48 volt lithium ion battery in the boot . Audi also uses it in uncoupling to go in a straight line . This S8 Q7 has loose anti robots . And then , as you turn a corner , it uses a 48 volt resistance motor effectively to tighten things up and really minimized body roll . Bentley Bentayga does exactly the same . Exactly the same thing on this engine . Really Sounds maker actually going through some drive by , put it into dynamic .

. But so then to go along with that acceleration , braking is equally important . And so , as you would expect , there are four wheel ventilated disc brakes standard .

Let's stop this review by talking about this car's key feature , and it is this swoopy back end . Now there's a trade off for it . It means the overall big capacity is 5% less than the X3 Sze . But it's not that big a deal , is it ? You think , But it's not the size that matters . It's what you do with it that counts . And here's the problem . You say , Well , this is nice and square . Generally , that lower tapered line for the boot means that you can't stack things too high further back . So , for instance , for us to try and shoot the boot now , it's not going to have any of it . Look , they didn't like that at all . Put that back up . Also , there's a bit of a boot lid there to lift stuff over , which can be a problem if you got heavy items such as this , at least is a metal plate there , so you don't scuff your paintwork . And that's where my complaints end , because this is actually a very useful , but there's lots of nice features . There's no bag . What's there to stop the shopping from rolling around the beat when you cornering Sturdy tie down tethers there . Look at that and you can remove them if you want . Then there's some strapping for your bottles on Looking from storage . No shit . Some removable storage jets , which can use to hold your manky date sushi , look the cover for the other floor Storage is not a gas Strat . Identical problems keeping it up . It's all right . Listen , I promise No more innuendoes in this video that says it's gonna turn into carry on car reviews . So if you look , there's some decent space , there's not a spare wheel . There's not even any tire repair kit because this conference on run flat tires now more on that later because it does actually matter . I think I do like about this there look like some other cars . You could fall down the back seats in here , levers in the boot so you don't have to go running around on the load area . It is pretty flat , as you can see there , which does make it easier to push these heavy items to the front .

In fact , the petrol tank in this car is especially sealed petrol tank because petrol goes off if you don't use it .

Braking is equally important . And so , as you can imagine , you will find four wheel disc brakes on the 2019 X5 . And as far as the breaking field does , definitely no issues there . And that touching on the suspension in handling a little bit more than 2019 X5 . Actually , the platform has been switched to the cluster architecture platform . It's called , and that is actually gonna be showed with the new 2019 3 Syriza's Well , so up front you will find a double wishbone front suspension into back a lightweight multilink integral rear suspension , and I did what also mentioned dynamic damper Control is also gonna come standard on the 2019 X5 , and essentially what that will do is monitor each individual shock absorber and adjusting the suspension in milliseconds , really giving you the best of both worlds . What's gonna tighten up during heavy corner and giving you better handling ? But it's also going to read the roads and perfections and give you a more comfortable ride as well . And that is one thing I can attest to . One of the first things I noticed when I got in the X5 is regardless of these punishing roads we have here in P A8 is quite a smooth ride in the 2019 X5 very impressed there .

It's still exactly the same . 444 brake horse power is in the outgoing , naturally aspirated V8 , which is odd . You might think that's strange . New car . Gin up the performance , However , on Bear with Me on this engine has actually downside . Now we shouldn't be too surprised that just because that's the way the world is going and die , Hi RS5 fans might be huffing and puffing and going . What is going on with the world , however , with the downsizing in engine capacity , is the upsizing in talk . And that is where turbo tech , really , where that twisting power that you get from talk is what we feel through our receptacles as a human , it's all about talk . That's what gives us that feeling of thrust when we mash our foot on the right hand pedal . So this car is actually up by £125 feet of tour , a very similar figure to its brake horsepower , is pushing out £443 feet of torque and 444 brake horsepower . Now that might not seem a great deal . But honestly , upon dropping a cog in this eight speed automatic gearbox will get on to that shortly . The talk is wonderful . I wouldn't say it's exactly organ bending , but the main thing is the Quattro system puts it down with the traction off a sticky J C B . It's like they're just gonna put superglue on some tracks and it's it to the asphalt . It's got so much traction . The great thing about downsizing and an engine in my eyes is mostly about downsizing the weight . So with two less cylinders smaller engine smaller .

And that is some serious amount of tyre on a car with Onley 335I horsepower . Yeah , only . So let's talk about how this car drives Now . One of the good things about a 48 volt system is that it does things like shut the engine off before you hit the stop sign or stoplight . So 15 miles an hour it will shut the engine off , making you coast to the stop light , and you won't know it because everything and there's a lot of electronics in here will remain on . But the engine will turn off , and it's relatively seamless , right ? The biggest complaint most people have with Stop Start is that whole car kind of shakes won . It turns back on , and it's kind of uncomfortable because if you're an old stop start system , the air conditioning may turn off , the heater may turn off , but here it's pretty much seamless . So that's a plus . Other pluses that Audi have always been kind of front heavy , right ? It's a trans versus the mounted engine , and all the wait is over the front wheels .

So , Chris , between going around a turn like this , you don't just want the wheel to feel heavy . But you wanted to communicate what the road is doing . So when the car's weight shifts because it will shift especially you taking quarters fast from the front wheels to the rear wheels , you know when that's happening . So that's when you know to put on the gas to give it as much potential power out of the corner as possible and oftentimes new electric steering cars . And what I mean by that , of course , is that these cars have gone to electric steering . They've lost that kind of tactile feel of actual road surface way .

There's some other models that you can get like a luxury , which doesn't look quite so good on a sport which is like halfway in between . So yet M6 port is where it is that really the lights as well . This one has integrated laser lights with the rangers in like , 500 meters , and they have , like the four circular design like you had on the E 46 A3 . Siri's really nice . I do like the front and decreasing the bottom . Look good down the sides , though I'm not quite so sure there's various lines increases going about the place . It looks a little bit Slaby . Look , the door handles there kind of is weird . Big cutaways . This would look so called pop out handles that even gets in it like a Range Rover Evoque down the back of the Hoffmeister King , which is a BMW classic design trait that it's three D . Now that looks pretty cool . I like the back . It looks good . This three D like design . You got two different tones of plastic there . It's very , very cold . And once again you have a different design for the rear end . For this M sport model has a diffuse ary effect down there . The lesser versions aren't quite so cool looking back , But is there any good front ? Good , rare , not so great down the sides on ending , but what do you think about the design ?

You have to slide it forward electrically . Doesn't do automatically like it doesn't . It was heavy . C class group A8 . And now you should be out , See what the heck is going on . All right , put the seat back on . Yeah , this was about the three way split folding rear seats . Now I'm gonna pull the seat back . That's easy . My driver's position got lots of knee room on headroom . It's not great , right ? But it's not on any of these cars . But out of these , these ku pays this forces is the best .

Well , come to the new car that let's deal with this new powertrain first , because it's really complicated . Two B s mers The boss off AMG loves of V8 . Probably a proper car blow . You'd like him . I like it . It's good . Noel Kahrs Canepa V8 Noel AMG scamper V8 because they're thirsty . Allowed there . So in the world's gotta get Big Green , hasn't it ? I suppose so . Anyway , they're juicy , sort of halfway house AMG models the 43 which is a three liter inline six with a bit more potent than usual , this new 53 model is moved on from that a bit again . It has a three liter inline six cylinder engine petrol engine , which is very smooth because inline six under engines are naturally perfectly balanced . But on top of that , it has one twin scroll turbocharger two on electric compressor Electric Turbo . If you want to call that electric supercharger , if you want to give it that name , that primary there to fill the talk gap in the turbo lag from the turbocharger . But then also on top of that , it also has what they call Ik ik . U Books don't want point to the back . It's actually in between the engine and the gearbox . The E Q . Is hey started about two slash alternator . It adds another 20 or horse power to the engines 425 or so , but it also adds some £120 for a talk , which is a lot . Anyway , all of those three things combined , and it's really complicated this right because the air goes in , it goes around against through the turbo charger , but then it could get sucked down by the electric compressor before it's even gone through the normal thing and it comes back just It's complicated , right ? Some companies you would trust to get that right . I think Mercedes-Benz M5 the time it's gone through all of that . It's gone through the boost e electric bit as well , then drives through a nine speed automatic gearbox primarily to the rear wheels , and it goes to the front wheels when they lose grip .

While this is a big heavy car , but don't rip the road well , obviously got cuatro four wheel drive that all well steering system fit to this car .

It handles very well , there's not too much role . My only complaint really is a steering . I mean , it's sharp enough and it's accurate enough . It just seems a little bit weird . Almost almost like you're playing a computer game . It is that the steering wheel isn't really connected to the front wheels .

So if you need to break to avoid hitting something , it will stop . If you need to steer around an obstacle , it will respond and change direction . The steering just works like that in a normal car , and it feels like it rather than just being something to hold on to . Of course , it's going to equality quickly . This thing will start to run wide , but considering weighs about as much as a fully grown white male rhinoceros , it handles pretty well . Now you can put into different modes with a Dr Select button and put into sports . If you want to in that wall do things like sharpen the throttle response . It'll make the engine sound a little bit more angry . It will also sharpen the shifts for the X and nice speed automatic gearbox , but it also stiffens up the suspension . That's not great , because already the car feels pretty firm , so obviously because it's a big , tall , heavy vehicle , they had to fit it with some stiff springs to stop it , leaning in the bends like a drunk at a bar . The problem with that is that whenever you go over a bump , any bump you feel it . It comes through to the cabin . I wouldn't say it was harsh , but the car is constantly fidgeting about been need .

Then , when it comes to the suspension first thing I wanted to mention when I first got into this one , I noticed this . The bolsters on the steering wheel are absolutely gigantic .

They definitely provide a better feel to your hands , giving you a better feeling of Maur control . I guess you could say that to go along with theirs grips , you will find an em specific suspension with the multi link aluminum rear suspension . And if you really wanted to push M5 if you go with that M5 competition package that is gonna give you a lower ride height along with retuned dampers also going to step in the springs in the anti roll bar by 10% .

You've been warned you can solve this problem with the optional adaptive suspension .

I will say BMW might want to think about reinforcing the area around the charge port . When you push this panel reflexes more than the ultimate warrior move inside and it's more of the same .

So that's one for the car gates and I want for the families is the fact that this car's boot is pretty large , actually , a standard . You get an automated tailgate . Now the size of it is actually quite a bit bigger than that of a Range Rover sport , and it's a little bit bigger than that that you'll find in a BMW X6 now a bit of a load lip to lift stuff across . That's not too much of a problem . What's problem or oven issue is the fact that the boot is quite shallow . Just hurt the opening because of these sloped rear . Don't have such a problem on the Q7 , which is square at the back end . So if you try and laid things like upright or pack it right to the rafters , the boot doesn't like it . Much as you can see now , it's all . But though there's plenty of space in here , it's a nice square shape . Otherwise , you got things like a 12 up socket there , which is good for plugging in a vacuum to clean out the boot .

On look this specific netted areas , which is ideal for your organic spinach and love . This one's ideal for celery . How cool is that in this ? Um , tethering points here , and I like the fact you've got these led lights there , which help illuminate the boot . Now , if you want to carry larger items , you can't just do it from here . You have to walk around to the seats because that's where you fold them down here at the seat basis and they just snapped into place would be careful with this one .

For me , the tribute to this car is that while it's as wild as a wolf , it can also be is controllable as a sheep dog .
