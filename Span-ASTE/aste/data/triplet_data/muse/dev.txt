How it'll plays together on this one is the BMW I three Rex with the range extended little petrol engine in the back that is almost impossible to hear when it's on .

I ask someone to show for me so I could see what it's really like to travel in the back of this four door coupe A8 . So is it salubrious enough ? Well , despite that sloping roof light , it's actually quite spacious . Look , loads and loads of room . I can't complain about that . Also , quite the fact that you've got these contoured seats in the back so they feel sport if you don't feel like you're part of the action , even if you're relegated to the rear . What's not so great , though , is that it does feel a bit dark Black into is no helping on DDE . Neither is the small rear window . So maybe I'll put this light on . It will help . So what ?

The first thing I want to point out is that mine was in an awesome blue color .

Just the exterior design was on point . It was fantastic a little bit about the interior . Um , the first thing I noticed when I got in the car is how fantastic the stitching is . There is blue stitching on everything here . It's on the seats . It's on the center console here . It's something Arm rest , conceit on the door there and there . It's on the back seats . The stitching is phenomenal . I love the stitching . I'm a big , big fan of stitching , so stitching everywhere . I know that saying stitching a lot , but I I'm really excited about it . That's my favorite thing about the inside . Beyond that , I was actually a little surprised to see that this one suspect with the wood trim , but I think it looks really great . Actually , it's really refined game . I think some of the other options are things like aluminum and aluminum is fine , but this definitely adds a level of sophistication that I really really dig . Um , Things take a little bit of Ah , down . Ah , downward spiral from there . I'm not a big fan of a couple of things . The first thing I wanna point out is that uses piano black trim , uh , for the for the aircon controls . And you also have a little bit of it down here with the parking brake and everything . And , you know , black is just one of those things where it's impossible to keep clean . You know , I picked this car up this morning , and it was obviously cleaned by the dealer before I got it . She could already see dust on other stuff . And fingerprints just show up . Really ? Well , I'm glad that they don't use it on a lot of the interior , but it is still disappointing that it's really on anything . Uh , the other thing I wanted to call it is the steering wheel . The steering wheel is covered in leather , and it feels pretty good to the touch . But I was a little disappointed that the stitching here is just black stitching . Um , especially since this is the M steering wheel that comes with the M sport package . The stitching on my car are proper in cars has the tri color BMW logo on the stitches . So I'm a little disappointed that they just used black for this . Um , that reminds me going back to the stitching .

Explain how this system works so you can have the court in a recuperation mode . And what that does is you're just basically rolling , but it's slowing your slightly because you've got the regenerative braking working . But you're not actually doing anything , and you activate that by pulling a paddle on the steering wheel . If you want that region breaking to be more severe , you pull that paddle again , and I'll give you even greater recuperation . Now what you can do if you get a little bit too quickly because this is steep down there , you might need to use the brakes , and then you apply the brake pedal on up to a certain level of breaking . It will just still be using the recuperation . The bracing won't use the hydraulic breaking , but the point that you need that extra stopping power . It will then blend in the normal brakes , and the way the system works is that it's all brake by wire . There's no step will change in the pedal . Feel it'll . It just does it all naturally and works out for you .

But so then , as you can probably imagine , judging by the trim levels there , there are two different engines set ups available for the X seven first , one being the three litre , twin power turbocharged inline six cylinder that is gonna belong to the extra F40 I that we have today .

That power is sent of ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which we will test out a little bit . Here , 0 to 60 time BMW puts it out approximately 5.8 seconds , with mpg numbers coming in a 20 in the city , 25 on the highway , and the X seven will give you an auto start . Stop system is well , so when you're stopped , a stops on or red light S7 will turn off automatically for you . Saving a little mpg is there as well , but the other engines set up along into the extra 50 I that is going to be a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged V8 , this one putting out 456 horsepower around 5200 rpm , £479 feet of torque available at 1500 rpm again sent all four wheels to an eight speed automatic .

I did want to mention there are some Dr moves located just behind the shifter there , and they're going to include ICO pro comfort sport and adaptive , which is really where the car decides what driving mood is best for your particular situation . But they're going to just things like the shift points . The Ronald response and the steering sensitivity is , Well , it's so .

Just hold on for dear life and of course , part of that are the tires , and the other part of that is the active suspension combined with all wheel drive . Normally , it's a 40 60 blip , which means that most of the power's going to the back of the 60% of it , and that gives this car very neutral .#### #### ####[([26], [25], 'POS'), ([31], [29, 30], 'NEU'), ([62], [63, 64], 'NEU')]

Our train isn't perfect , though , for the accelerator . From a stop , the engine takes a moment before the turbo spools up power kicks in . Also , the automatic engine start stop system might save fuel . When the vehicle to stop , we found the engine restarts to be jarring , you know , feel free to turn the system off .

Yeah , it is . Look , that opens that way , but it also opens . Why ? It's really clever . You got some cup holders . Hey , it is a place for you , Kay . You also have decent sized door Benz really important in this class . It will take a bottle of champagne . The glove box is rather small . There's this thing in it . Look like there again .

This breaks that comes standard on this one and in my short drive today have had absolutely no issues with a breaking feel or anything like that . When it comes to the handling it suspension on the X seven , you will find a double wishbone front suspension in the back of lightweight multilink integral rear suspension and one of the best parts about the X seven . Contributing to its smooth ride is there is a to Axl self leveling air suspension . It's so this is basically gonna automatically adjust its height based on road conditions , meaning If the X seven cents is you were going on the back roads going a little faster than perhaps you should be , it's gonna lower the X seven a little bit , providing a little better handling . And at the same time , if you're just cruising , it's gonna raise that height up to not only give you better ground clearance but give you a more comfortable ride as well . And it actually gets better than that because you can manually adjust The height of the X seven is well located just behind the shifter there . That's gonna give you the ability to raise the X seven up 1.6 inches above the standard setting if you wanted to . So really quite a bit of control . And again , with that air suspension , you're going to get so much of a smoother ride as opposed to an SUV without it . So definitely a very high end suspension setup , if that is a thing so very nice there .#### #### ####[([73], [72], 'POS'), ([73], [169, 170], 'POS'), ([33], [137], 'POS'), ([94], [184, 185, 92], 'POS'), ([73], [249], 'POS'), ([35], [20, 262, 263, 264, 266], 'POS'), ([35], [86, 262, 275], 'POS'), ([231], [226, 227, 20, 132], 'POS')]
It didn't want me to do electric , only driving . It wanted me to use the petrol engine , which it suddenly did . So this is what a lot of proper blokes like these cars , these fairly small but BMW . But we're quite large engines because they've got a lot of Polk . They've got a lot of low in grunt . They've got a lot of month , all those sort of things . Now that is a very bad way of describing . That is , what I'm doing is adopting , for those of you outside the UK essentially a slightly working class British accent . When I do that , I'm gonna do it again . They've got a lot of grudge .#### #### ####[([42], [39, 40], 'NEU'), ([48], [46, 47], 'POS')]
Also , it gets air suspension , so it's even more comfortable over bumps in the sport of 50 day plus , even raise the right height by 40 millimeters if you want to go off road . Speaking of which , I think will just go off road here , So I'm gonna press the button to raise at the suspension . Let's raise it up . And now I have a little girl driving over here .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [10, 11, 12, 13], 'POS')]

But today I'm going to be driving down to win just out where I went to University . I've got a few meetings down there on it gives a good opportunity to stretch this car's legs . Find out what it's like on the motorway . Find out what it's like off the motorway on . Just try and get an all round good first impression of this car . I'm gonna be doing quite a lot more miles than I did in the Lamborghini in the Esther Martin that I drove not so long ago .

I'm also flogging the day , which I think has already gone out before on this video .#### #### ####[([78], [71, 5, 73, 74, 20, 76, 77], 'POS')]
Three . You sit a lot lower and the center a lot more hugging , which is really , really nice . And the one favorite bit is how high the sense of concern is . And I think that comes with a lot of supercars , especially the Lamborghini Gallardo . They start in the center console on this bit , is really high and makes a really nice arm rest . Ah , nde . Unlike the R8 , you don't actually have to compromise using one of your cup holders to use it as an arm rest . If you remember my cup holders in the R8 right down the middle , you he's using his cup holders or used it as an arm rest . You can use it but this has a cup holder on isn't compromised when I put my arm there .#### #### ####[([9], [4, 5, 12, 13], 'POS'), ([9], [17, 17, 20], 'POS'), ([9, 57], [17, 29], 'POS'), ([91, 138], [140, 86], 'NEU')]
And , of course , there are high end finishes throughout this one . For example , on the one we have today , there are wood finishes throughout , as well as a two tone leather finish on this , also with mentioning even the latch to open up the glove box there in front of the passenger . Lot of times it will be a plastic that kind of goes with the front there , but it is not . It is an aluminum finish that goes with the trim accents on the doors , and the dash is , well , so big fan of that well done BMW .#### #### ####[([9], [7, 8], 'POS'), ([37], [26], 'NEU'), ([37], [36], 'NEU'), ([36], [34, 35], 'NEU')]

I'm gonna take this off . Thistles not trained yet . All It's very poor example of a man bag , but this is a great example of a small SUV because , yes , it may be small , but it's actually got a decent size boot Facts from the biggest boots for this size of car . Yes , there's a little bit of a lift to lift things over , but you get this nice , posh , shiny scuff plates so you don't scratch that beautiful blue paint work when you drag your luggage out on book Boot is a nice square shaped different storage areas down there , and down there you have tether points as well to tie things to which is great hooks to hang things off . And look at this lovely feature . Good old Audi . You can wedge the false floor applied to mess around down here . Now you can't get it with a space saver spare wheel . This one actually has what looks like a somewhat for for that graded stereo system here in the boot . But that is detectable . If you need the space , this one doesn't have a spare well like I say , it's got the tire sealant group , which isn't great , but it's an extra storage areas round there . If you need that Andi look , you can , of course , lower the boot for just a bit more capacity that you're probably best leaving it up like that if you wanted to lower the rear seats . Problem is , when you come to loathe those receipts , you have to walk around to the back . Which is a bit annoying is that leaves right down at the sea , Bass said . Cock around that . It's just bear with me . Bear with me . Imagine dealing with a bunch of restless children or shopping and having to do this nightmare . That's one oversight . Audi wish it had leaves in the boot to lower those seatbacks . Well , look , once you've load them . Nice , flat , spacious , spacious floor . Denny's decide things right to the front of the car . Now I just put the seats back .#### #### ####[([46], [29], 'NEU'), ([57], [25, 15], 'POS'), ([47], [45, 46], 'NEU'), ([47], [51, 53, 3, 46, 16, 57], 'POS'), ([67], [63, 64], 'NEU'), ([82, 83], [77], 'POS'), ([82, 83], [81], 'POS'), ([82, 83], [79], 'POS'), ([91], [89], 'POS'), ([91], [90], 'POS'), ([47], [77], 'POS'), ([47], [105], 'POS'), ([129], [25], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [139, 140], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [176, 177, 183, 184], 'POS'), ([150, 151], [194], 'POS'), ([150, 151, 108], [7, 25], 'NEG'), ([47], [147, 246, 53, 64, 253, 254], 'POS'), ([270, 271], [246], 'POS'), ([270, 271], [287, 155, 50, 291, 68, 246], 'NEG'), ([270, 271], [297], 'NEG'), ([151], [77], 'POS'), ([151], [369], 'POS'), ([151], [371], 'POS')]
