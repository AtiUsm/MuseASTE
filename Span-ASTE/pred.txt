If you love classic BMW design , you'll probably love this new 7 50 i . But from my point of view , I find the design just a little too busy . It's almost like they threw in every single BMW que into one vehicle . I actually thought the Mercedes-Benz had a much more holistic design . It was a little bit more striking , a little bit more road presence course . This is a long wheelbase version , but nevertheless , the mark in my book was a better looking car when my figure features of this technology .#### #### ####[([5], [2], 'POS'), ([79], [78], 'NEU'), ([94], [92, 93], 'POS')]

One of the best advantages about this specific speck is these bad boys here , the paddles , the s tronic gearbox .

Why Q3 It is getting a bit , but I was trying to spruce it up with a new grill and some flash new tail lights on . When you jump on the inside the interior of this car , I mean , it's all very nice . It's well made . It's typical . Audi quality is just that . It's one of the older generation of Audi cars . Rather one of the more modern ones that they knew Q5 , for instance , of the new A4 and as a result of the design , is starting to feel a little bit on the old side .

They might be wondering where the heck you can keep these rather cumbersome low cover as well . Don't you worry , because look at this underneath here . There's some special cutaways for them , so they should fit just perfectly on out of the way . Uh , this car has an active grill , so when the engine doesn't need cooling , it remains shut for improved aerodynamics .

Coke bottles at classic sexy shape that shows you the haunches of the car shows you the big tires . This car is sleek in the front , But if you come with me back here , there was that classic Coke Bible shape . The haunches kind of come out , the tires get wider and fatter , at least visually , and it looks like it's much more aggressive . So Fleek in the front , aggressive and pretty tough looking in the back . And also , this is kind of interesting Designer pointed this out . If you look , the gas cap has been completely incorporated above this cut line so that it doesn't go into this line . Makes it a lot cleaner makes it a lot sexier .

So the big boat in the room with the Audi TT RS is the price , not the base price , but more prices tested . And this has got the number of options and the men . Roni is in the trunk areas . I can't run down everything for it , but the base price is 65 roughly 65 5 Okay , that's not an unreasonable amount of money for this vehicle , especially performance level quality of materials , et cetera . No issues with that . But as tested with driver , performance pack and carbon trim and other bits and bobs on here , a role in a price rolling a picture that Maroni so you can see all the options here comes out to $80,000 . 80,000 and $200 . Now that is a stretch for this vehicle . Only because you are getting into say , use 9 11 territory and not very old . Use 9 11 territory like 23 like off two year , three year off lease 9 11 territory . And this compared to a 9 11 Well , it's 9 11 all day .

You know what ? It doesn't actually feel like a normal BMW to drive . It's It's more like a Mercedes , actually part . The reason for that is that you get adaptive air suspension of standard on .

It does fidget around a bit more than the super smooth Mercedes-Benz class . You can tell they're really trying her on the side of comfort with this car .

So what are the changes that felt so good on track translate to on the road ? It doesn't take long to realize they're actually the same feel on dhe interaction . You gone circuit you could access very usually on the road . Changes to the suspension are not fundamental , but the little tweaks that there are make a big difference . That struck brace in front just seems thio , given extra amount of stiffness , which translate back into the steering rack so the steering is much more precise .

It's so anyway , probably worth to think . BMW always have this reputation for being supported . To drive . This one doesn't live up to the reputation because it's it's quite all on its own heavy car as well . So when you throw it into Cory doesn't mean quite a lot . And you also know that much of an idea what the front wheels are doing in terms of grip because of steering . It's almost like playing a computer game . It's a bit remote , but really , do you care ?

But I also think that export competes against cars like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and the Jack o R F pace , because those are also yes , more traditional crossovers . But they'll have sleek designs and there high performance luxury machines , so there's actually quite a bit of competition in the space . But the X line up of cars for BMW is a very popular line up , especially the new X two , the X four and the X6 sport activity coops , as they call them , Progress is the name of the game onto the hood .#### #### ####[([36], [35], 'POS'), ([58, 60], [67, 68], 'POS')]

Can't complain about the automatic gearbox , so I really love it . A8 speeds , and it's very smooth . You put your foot down and responds instantly . And if you want to , you can change gears yourself , using the paddles to make it feel a bit more sporty . Actually , BMW specifically said this car up to feel sporty , so they've given it slightly firmer suspension than the X3 on . Do you do notice that round Town ? It just seems to pick up the bumps a bit more . Feel a bit firmer than you might imagine . However , you cannot great twosome , adaptive suspension on that as a comfort mode , and it's only 500E . It is well worth it . So you put into comfort slackens off the suspension on . Then it is better that this car still feels just that little bit Verma to drive . Then say something about the Mercedes GLC coop A . And it's definitely firmer still in the X3 . Now , when you encounter twisty road , you will experience the benefit of this course sporty set up . So if you put into sports mode , it lad , way to the steering shop , the throttle response . And if you got the adaptive suspension , it'll stiffen that up to . And then when you took this thing into a corner , it really doesn't lean it all . It's quite surprising for a tall SUV just how well it handles on this . X four is more fun to drive than the X3 , if ever complain . No , it's a steering . It's not quite a sharp is that in an Alfa Stelvio , you see , you can't be subtle with it . It won't pick up on hints safe . You're like , really like it over there . I'd like to be over there , to the will of it . It just doesn't respond .

First , let's address the small part . Rear seat headroom Certainly better than the C l . A . But I'm five foot 10 and just barely brushes up against the headliner over here in the right seat .

Taking part of place , though , is the new infotainment system , so it's BMWs . I drive seven , and it's better than ever . It's absolutely fabulous . It's dead . Easy to control . You can swipe through the different menus down the side here , using the swivel Will Andi . Then , if you want , you can use it as a touch screen and slide through this slates like that . You can also operate it with gesture commands a lot . So that's a volume . Come on , come on that we can Finally , as you can see , it's a little bit temperamental . There we go .

It's just high definition on then some , because it looks like that image has been spray painted on . Doesn't like graphics ? It's that sharp . Also , the system includes a full digital drivers display . Now I don't think it's quite good to someone that you can get in an Audi Q . A8 because you can't have full wide screen satnav it there . You just have it in between the two dials . Also , the Rev counter runs backwards , like in Persia . Don't want BMW doing that . It's a little bit odd , but it's totally okay , and it shows lots of different information , and you can cycle through things just yes , stereo on DSI things , that engine boost and how much talk it's producing and G force .

Another problem is a hybrid system itself . Right . So you got electric motor on board this car Andi compound R8 for up to 90 miles at speeds of up to 75 miles an hour .

There's no doubt about it . Audi cabins are just plush and gorgeous , very well appointed . You got a 10.1 inch screen up here . I think I got an eight point something in J 8.0.6 inch screen . Down here , the clarity of the screens is insane . It's a bit of an acquired taste , but all your heater controls your seat controls your climate and you're you , your descent mode and everything in the union . You now is all touch green . The only tactile button is this one , which is your volume control for your radio and your station shift . This is a sort of semi floating , pretty deep center console . It's a chunky thing I've got . You know , my notebook in here , which is large , my phone . And there's two cupholders down here , and there's even . There's even if you vertically stack it a place to wirelessly charge your phone just on the left inside here . So it's deep in there . It's quite fat fee , but it's deep and there's , Ah , there's two more U . S . Bees . Another 12 volt socket on . There's another deep cubby in here , so plenty of storage on the go . I really like this part , a real like this . It's like a strange rest rest , even though you don't need to shift gears . It's kind of what you do . If you were shifting gears and then you got your your shift a button . Is this aluminium sleight of a put my foot on the brake . Now you just knock it with your thumb into reverse or pull it back into D or into sport . And then press park on the side is lovely brushed aluminium finished throughout .

Another thing that I'm really impressed by is the brake field . A lot of hybrids harness that power by the brakes . Just have a horrible feeling . Brake pedals . You kind of have this awful sensation that you're pressing against something , and the car is not slowing down . And yet when you tell you foot off the throttle , you see a treacle . The I It's not like that . But there is this slight feeling of drag you get when you come off trouble . But it's not too strong on the field through the pedal itself .

Another thing this car has is mold hybrid technology . So you've got a 48 volt battery fit into this thing on it allows it to coast .

This particular car is the three liter V six days or it's got 286 horsepower north , sixth day in around 5.7 seconds . And it's a really nice , smooth , strong engine , so there's layers of pulling power definitely suits this car very well . You can also get it from launch with a three liter V six Twin turbo petrol , which has more horsepower but less talk so it doesn't suit it .

The steering . It is good with a small D . Why ? I think it feels a little bit fake . To be perfectly honest , it's very accurate . You could be very precise where you put the nose , but the field is a bit weird , and that is because there's a bit more steering that meets the eye . In fact , I might have to slow down , stop and show you what's what it's all to do with the EM drive system because you've now got two buttons which changed not only the characteristics within the steering , but also the dampers and the throttle response on gear change speed as well .

So of course it does . And where is the M 135 I is now on fixed rate dampers . The M two still has a comfort mode . That means it has a more settled ride quality in normal driving .

Now , in terms of boot space , the capacity is on a par with its German rivals . When you got the seats in the normal configuration , you also stand to get a automated tailgate . You may like that , or you may know it depends on your point of view . So the bitch itself is a nice square shape , but it's not 100% perfect . For instance , there is a little ridge to lift stuff over . It's not too bad , but other cars like this you can slide him straight out . There is no lip . Also icon for the life of me find a 12 volt socket in here , a standard . There are various tethering points here and here under this floor . Yes , there's not much room for anything else . We've got all the gubbins for the puncture repair kit now . Like I said earlier , this one has the upgraded rear seats on , as well as being all to move forwards and backwards actually moving forward . You increase the boots capacity by around affair . You can fold them down individually . So look , you can fall down the middle one on this other car . You can't do that and you can fool the others using these levers . The only problem is as you can see they don't actually fall down very well on their own accord . So you have to Kevin , do it yourself . I want you moving down . You kind of got a almost continuous load space there . It's a little bit of a fact . You don't expect that from an Audi , do you ?

You could just wish through all the menus very easily , and you can operate it using this swivel wheel here in the shortcut buttons . That's the best years when you're driving , but when you're stationary , you can use it as a touch screen . So it's just like your smartphone or tablet . If you don't want to do that , you can use gesture controls . Look , you just wave your finger about . You can also in put things into the sat nav using this touch pad .

Just move this one out of the way as well , so you can see what the heck's going on back here . So pull the seat back into our position . Now Audi has made this A5 sorry Long room wide and taller than the old one , and as a result , there is more room in the back , though there's still not a great deal . So look , I'm sitting up . My head is wedged against the roof . Now Nearing is okay ish . I can slouch a bit , but still taller . People won't like it much in the back of this car .

That's a lot of ways very elegant , or if I want to know where I'm going to turn it back on , Audi says this car is basically Level two economy . But you know , as I'm driving or not driving along here because we want , I get the feeling that there isn't much that would keep this car from being fully autonomous , kind of pink talking off the side of the lane lines . But for the most part , I've got my foot off the brake . I've got my hands off the wheel , and this car is driving itself a least for a little bit maybe wondering how long will do that before television with my hands back on the wheel and Audi says it really depends on speed of the car .

Now , normally , at this part of the review , we talk about hydrocarbons gasoline . But now we don't get to talk about electrons because , well , let's talk about the gas part . It's a brand new three litre six cylinder that is now turbocharged instead of super charge , and it puts out 335I horsepower and £369 foot of torture made it to a seven speed s tronic . That's dual clutching Audi speak , and Audi says it goes from 0 to 60 and 5.2 seconds . The A6 doesn't in 5.1 because £100 lighter . But let me show you something interesting . I think it's right here . It's this red cable . And that's because this is also a mild 48 volt hybrid , which allows this car to do things like turn this gasoline engine off 15 miles and hour , which is right before you get to the stop sign so that it gets a 25 mpg combined , which is actually to better in the old cars 23 . So electrons in this case can be very fuel efficient .#### #### ####[]

He put your foot down in one of those . It's been done , but they want to go sideways . This just rips on goes also , I think that BMW and the Mercedes have a bit more front and biters watching . When you turn them into a corner , they just start in the nose digs and they just turn this one not so much . But once you get into a rhythm with it , yeah , it is good fun . It really is . Only only complaint really has to be the fact that the suspension settings aren't quite right for the UK , so Comfort's great when you're cruising around , but it's just a little bit too soft . Really . Thrashing the cars in the corner does lean a bit too much . And then when you put in the dynamic mode to make it better , it's nice and flat in the corners . Bart , the problem is , is then just a little bit too bouncy over bumps . There is another mode called Auto , whether Costas is it out . But that still doesn't quite cut the mustard . Really .

Don't even tell you how fast I'm going . But , uh , I can show you . Actually check this out . We could do a 0 to 60 on this car to give you the exact number that could what this car can do .

I really wanted to phone in this review . I could just say that the latest generation Audi Q7 is an exceptionally nice A7 passenger luxury SUV .

Definitely a very nice sound system . Plenty of base . I don't need the massaging seats because there was so much base , but definitely very nice . More than enough of a sound system for the X seven . By the way , another thing I wanted to mention to turn that radio up or down there is just your control available . That's what I've been playing around with quite a bit in this one . So simply turned your finger in a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation that's going to turn the volume up or down . Definitely pretty fun to play around with .#### #### ####[([4, 5], [2, 3], 'POS'), ([4, 5], [7, 9], 'POS'), ([16], [15], 'POS')]

And it stops well . They're properly big stops on the circuit , right ? So let's say you've been driving this around for a few sets . A lapse as I have in four wheel drive mood with your aides left on . Andi kind of got to grips with what it can do . Performance level , fraction level , grip , level , balance in the car . I mean , it might take you , you know , 10 laps to get there . It might take you 10 track days to get there , but you'll get there as you would in any drop this car . So what do you do ? You stick it in drift mode , don't you ? Because no one knew . And it's not the easiest thing is this process to undergo ? But I've done it even though AMG probably would rather I hadn't because I want everything . This car is a bluff skins . Mrs Wembley does skins . I'm in a very sort of simple , honest way . This is a great handling car because it goes well goes really hard . Stops pretty well , but a bit of understeer in it because it's a big , heavy car . But even informal drive mode gives you lots of options to drive around it and neutralize it . But that's the sort of thing it's greater . Proper AMG . Turn it all off duty piece , kids . I know , I know M5 do this as well . And I dare say Porsche Panamera , it's probably won't probably will if I don't already . But it just feels like a MG thing , doesn't it ? Look , it wouldn't be a proper AMG if it didn't do it , So yeah , it does . It does it right just a bit . And then it gets way missing back on the brakes . No bother . I like I like a lot . You know what started off just with a bit of a downer about this car ? Because it felt a bit . It felt a bit naughty and a bit dishonest to use a sports cars identity , you know , celebrate sort of what amounts to a big super saloon , really kind of figure . It could never be good enough to drive to live up to that , and it's not a sports car , but for a two ton four seater . It's pretty great , You know , this thing does all the basics . Well , it's got great steering field . It's really progressive . It's easy to drill it quickly on . It's a great GT-R because that's what it's about . Really . Order this stuff on a racetrack today ? Pretty fun . But it's kind of neither here nor there because of GT-R .#### #### ####[([189], [188], 'POS'), ([69], [459, 461], 'POS'), ([110], [459, 461], 'POS'), ([451, 452], [459, 461], 'POS')]
But at least that 25 horsepower advantage comes in a car that weighs £130 less , thanks to carbon ceramic brakes , manual seats , reduced sound insulation in the engine compartment , a smaller fuel tank and a bunch of carbon fibre thrown around the car well attached to the car , you know .#### #### ####[([26, 27], [25], 'NEG'), ([35, 36], [34], 'NEU')]
The rays driving position is particularly good when you're driving in time because you can even look down on people in rain drivers . Yes , they're making their king of the road . But in the G class , you are the emperor of the road and visit . It is good all round . So you got this shallow dash , and that , combined with the upright windscreen , means that you get a great view forward . And it helps that you can actually use the little indicators on the wings as sites . And then there's the wheel arches . They mean that you can actually see where the alloys Artie , don't curb them when you're trying to park on this big glass area , even the backing a huge rear window , it's partly obscured by that spare wheel , but it's not too bad .#### #### ####[([2, 3], [5, 6], 'POS'), ([61], [60], 'NEG'), ([70], [69], 'NEU'), ([78, 79], [77], 'POS'), ([136, 137], [135], 'POS')]

I'm still not a huge fan . I have not fall in love with BMWs . User interface . There's a lot of little buttons . There's a lot of ways you can toggle switches . There's a lot of sub menus at the end of the day , it's very functional . It very complicated . This is a system that is not incredibly intuitive . If you buy this car , I'm willing to bet that you're gonna have to break out the owner's manual when you want to do very simple things , like program your favorite stations . And that's an issue . I love the fact that Germans built a lot of functionality into everything they do . It's all very logical . It's all very straightforward . But at the end of the day , more functionality sometimes the less user friendliness , and this car kind of falls in between that . So I'll give it a five on the functionality slash user friendliness scale when it comes to the latest version of the I Drive , you might be asking yourself , Why not just get the station wagon ?#### #### ####[]
But talking about like the ride height . A lot of people have asked me How good is it over speed ? But it's actually not bad , probably about that much .

The storage is better than you get with a Christmas cracker , so there's little area , heavy keys and 12 volt socket . This little compartment here , maybe for you cigars , or if you're trying to give up smoking your chocolate bar , you got some deep cup holders as well , which is good because it means that they can hold the tall of bottles on the door . Bends are so huge that can carry two bottles of water . You got big storage area here as well . You can't see from there . So don't worry . I can actually open it this way . How clever is that ?

Okay , so the feeling of quality is a little bit more superficial than in the BMW , but can't fault this drive in position .

I'll just show you in the back of the car . You do get air conditioning vents in the back of this . You've got ice . So fix child seats . For those of you with children , sit around here .

As you can see , if you want to carry items in the boot and I need a bit more space , you can ask your rear passengers sit more of pride because it does increase the low capacity . But people really don't wanna travel like that . Aren't they really , she carrying really large items you're gonna need to fold the seats down and to do it . A two stage process , which is a bit of a fast these days for these seat backs . They do lie flat . The problem is that you have this huge ridge here . Now it's gonna be really hard to push heavy items right to the front of the car . Now let's talk about the actual boot space , so this door opens sideways , so it's really awkward to do in tight spaces . Also , it's really heavy because you got that spare with on the back of this There , you got the quilting here . That's really nice now . What's not so nice , though , is the fact that you really do have to kind of lift things up quite a way to get them into this . Because unlike a Range Rover , there's no air suspension , so you can't lower the car down to make that easier . Also , the tow hitch it's fixed . It's not retractable once again , like it's retractable on a Range Rover that we can still toe the same 3.5 tons . This car's that's pretty good , but also pretty good is that there's no lower lip . So once you've got things appear , there is enough to slide in on this very tender points around the place . You got 12 volt socket here as well . You've also got a boot liner there to keep it nice and clean . Z8 don't dirty the carpet . Unfortunately , under there , there's no extra storage , which is annoying because really , you could do is somewhere to put the removable parcel shelf . So now it's just kind of lay like that . Maybe I see what's going on because I want to show you the boot size yet . It's very big , but it's not quite as big as a Porsche Cayenne . You might be wondering what the heck this bag is . Well , actually , more on that later in the video is the last thing I wanna point out . Is this this national guttering around the roof ? So what ? It's raining that could get filled it with water .

However , you do get so much more . Performance Power comes from a 4.4 litre twin turbo V8 with 600 horsepower and 750 Newton meters of talk , which is impressive , though not quite as impressive as Mercedes-Benz V8 , which has 610 horsepower and 850 Newton meters . Still , this BMW is available with this rather lovely optional carbon fiber engine cover . I think I might just have that and see him something . Get it on eBay . Wonderful notices gone . The standard fit rear end differential could move power about between the back wheels descended the wheel with the most grip for improved corner exiting traction . Now , while the old M5 years a deal clutch automatic gearbox , this one has an eight speed with a tall converter , which may make it seem about as modern as this mountain bike . But the reason they've gone for a talk converter is that it's smoother , and it's strong enough to cope with this car's extra talk . The engine has a special high pressure oil system , which works in high G conditions . So when you're calling really faster that you don't get oil starvation and damaged the engine , you better put your cap back . Otherwise , I may actually damage the engine . When you start the M5 , it automatically has a sports exhaust in its and loudest setting , which is exactly what you wanted and after fat around , turning it on to make it sound as good as it can and will you rev it ?

I didn't open the exhaust up too much , but what I did do was absolutely nail it to the floor . Didn't change gear until seven and 1/2 1000 revs which spoken up the exhaust on really gives it that epic epic V8 sound . Just I'll get addicted to it . I really get addicted Thio putting my foot down in this car because the great thing is about the Audi R8 V8 .

Now that particular car I'm driving here is fitted with four wheel steering , so at low speeds it can turn the back wheels five degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels , and that should make it super maneuverable .

It's a little bit boy racer . Really ? For Macey's , that's just not right . You may be better off going for the three litre diesel .

Yes . Oh , that's 16 way back . They're gonna keep on going . That's enough . No , it's a six day , 3.5 seconds all day .

In fact , when I tested this RS4 on the dyno , it was producing 16 horsepower more than it was supposed to . And that brings me on to five other things which are impressive about this car .
