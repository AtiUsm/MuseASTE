291,8,"audi has created a very bespoke experience in the new , eh ? what is this spoke mean ? it just means unique and custom . basically , there are seven different profiles that you can choose from that customized 400 different features of the car . everything from what kind of besides you want how you want your temperature settings to where you want your seat , where you want your steering wheel , the normal stuff . plus , of course , all the things that you could do with a car with air suspension so you can have different dr select from comfort to dynamic the sport and the newest feature . that's very akin to if you know mercedes-benz class are electric doors so unheard open door . all you have to do is just gently upon the handle and the door opens . who , of course , to close it , just gently close it in the door . does the rest of the work perhaps the coolest feature of this audi are these events that now close and open kind of has a way of greeting you when you walk into the car incredibly silent and they're incredibly cool ? and you may be thinking to yourself , you know , the jaguar accepted that a long time ago , and i suspect the guys that audi would tell you that the volkswagen fate on did it even before the jaguar . but it is a cool party . trick and event not only kind of reclines into the dashboard , but the piece of wood then closes to give you one giant and , i think very elegant , beautiful bit of wood . one of my favorite features is , of course , google earth . and check this out . of course , you can zoom in , or if you want , you can zoom out . i can show you actually where we are right there . there's the pacific and there's pch won the pacific coast highway . they're not one , not two . but now , in fact , three different screens that air customizable that do everything from control how the seats missiles you to senate air coming into the cabin too . of course , your music , your navigation and , of course , a lot of other features . so let me have anthony tell you and show you what thes three different screens can actually accomplish . so it's pretty configurable , right ? you've got this screen you can configure so you can put you could put for instance , you're right now you've got your speedometer , and your rpm's very small , but you can make a bigger right , sure , and so you can set it up . but if you want the you don't need if you're around home , you don't want your map up there or you you'd rather have your your media playing your radio . you can have the large gauges that you're used to on dhe . you know , out here you could put your map if you wanted to just have an idea where you are and you can , you know , we've brought with this new generation , the gesture control , just like you'd expect from a tablet on . then if you decide all , i'd rather have my radio stations here in the center on and the math over here , you can reverse it . so it's really set up that you can set the car up the way you like it . and now with the new generation of a8 , we have profiles so that when you get in the car , the the car will ask , is anthony my car ? i'm gonna get in . it's gonna say , driver profile , anthony , is this you ? if it's not , you can scroll down , right when you get in the car goes the next profile , and then it will set up to 400 different settings within the car . so when i get out of the car when i'm done today , it's gonna memorize . that's the way anthony wanted the car set up . and next time i get in , if my wife had the car and she had a different profile , when i get in , i can switch it to anthony . the car just changes all around . it changes the presets and the shortcuts that you have the icons that the way . it's all set up here in the m m i . the ambient lighting color , the temperature , the driver , assistant settings , everything . and these are the types of things . as you drive the car , you will set this up and i'm set it and forget it . and then and it can all come back to the way you like it if someone else is driving or if you share a car . so the profiles are a really powerful way of , of kind of customizing and making a car familiar to you . every time you get it , you can set it up in your profile that you get a fragrance you have winter or summer fragments of the car smells good when you get out of there with one of the friends of the fragrances air in here in the h faxes system . here , you you have him on there's a nine isar a cz wells . the fragrance it's that's in here , and you can set which fragrance you want with winter summer and how subtle we haven't set on light . just it's something . it's really a preference , and we didn't want it to be too strong . you're smart phone when you put your finger over it , it's gonna execute that command based on the heat there , i can see i'm driving along . i want to make a phone call . i'm focused on the road to put my finger here . all i see orange in my proof revision i want i know phone is green . i wanted the phones and i put my finger , i see the green and then i give it a push . and so that way you'll have the deliberate command executed , not the one that your finger went to first . so , you know , touch screens have been around for a little while , but most of them , when you put your finger over him , it's gonna execute that . and then and then you can add frustration because you're driving . we want you focused on the road and i put my finger in between . phone is on so i can push that . so that's literally away toe . take some of the stress out of the driving , takes on the cognitive load off and make it a bit more intuitive . and just like the previous a8 , we've got this fixed place for your wrist so that you can control everything before we had 35 buttons . now we've gotten rid of the only time . i don't need to write anything here right now . why would we ? right , you're not just for fun while i want to put a navigation destination , and now i'm gonna put this in . now it transforms to , ah , writing pad on me , and you get some tips in here . the first time is a brand new car . so it gives you these tips , um , and then down below , we have natural handwriting recognition . in the past , you had to write block letters . now you can write left to right or right on top , so okay , well , look for starbucks . um , that's the one that everyone loves to look for . and then it has . now , we're going to a cloud to do the points of interest . and if i don't want starbucks now very easily , you just scroll and get rid of that . or if i'd rather put it in with the keyboard , just touching the corner . starbucks . you can also , um , right directly on top handwriting so i can do just right on top . still find it left . right ?

right , you're not just for fun while i want to put a navigation destination , and now i'm gonna put this in . now it transforms to , ah , writing pad on me , and you get some tips in here . the first time is a brand new car . so it gives you these tips , um , and then down below , we have natural handwriting recognition . in the past , you had to write block letters . now you can write left to right or right on top , so okay , well , look for starbucks . um , that's the one that everyone loves to look for . and then it has . now , we're going to a cloud to do the points of interest . and if i don't want starbucks now very easily , you just scroll and get rid of that . or if i'd rather put it in with the keyboard , just touching the corner . starbucks . you can also , um , right directly on top handwriting so i can do just right on top . still find it left . right ?

291,8,"audi has created a very bespoke experience in the new , eh ? what is this spoke mean ? it just means unique and custom . basically , there are seven different profiles that you can choose from that customized 400 different features of the car . everything from what kind of besides you want how you want your temperature settings to where you want your seat , where you want your steering wheel , the normal stuff . plus , of course , all the things that you could do with a car with air suspension so you can have different dr select from comfort to dynamic the sport and the newest feature . that's very akin to if you know mercedes-benz class are electric doors so unheard open door . all you have to do is just gently upon the handle and the door opens . who , of course , to close it , just gently close it in the door . does the rest of the work perhaps the coolest feature of this audi are these events that now close and open kind of has a way of greeting you when you walk into the car incredibly silent and they're incredibly cool ? and you may be thinking to yourself , you know , the jaguar accepted that a long time ago , and i suspect the guys that audi would tell you that the volkswagen fate on did it even before the jaguar . but it is a cool party . trick and event not only kind of reclines into the dashboard , but the piece of wood then closes to give you one giant and , i think very elegant , beautiful bit of wood . one of my favorite features is , of course , google earth . and check this out . of course , you can zoom in , or if you want , you can zoom out . i can show you actually where we are right there . there's the pacific and there's pch won the pacific coast highway . they're not one , not two . but now , in fact , three different screens that air customizable that do everything from control how the seats missiles you to senate air coming into the cabin too . of course , your music , your navigation and , of course , a lot of other features . so let me have anthony tell you and show you what thes three different screens can actually accomplish . so it's pretty configurable , right ?
