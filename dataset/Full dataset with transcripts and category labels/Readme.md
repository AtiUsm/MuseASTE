- **ASTE Annotations:** Full  ASTE annotations. The id, segment_id, columns in the train.csv and devel.csv files of our annotation dataset match with the id, and segment_id, columns of  the train and devel files in the original MuSe-Topic dataset.
  
- **Category Annotations:** Created our own fine grained category annotation which is based on each triple, instead of segment wise like Muse. The aspect and topic labels are in AspectCategoryLabelCompleted.csv, and TopicCategoryLabelsCompleted.csv. Car Dataset Categories Readme.pdf contains a description of these categories. All annotations combined is in FinalFullAnnotationsAllLabelsCompleted.csv
