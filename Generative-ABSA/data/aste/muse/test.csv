It d couples the engine from the wheels on you just roll along on that helps save fuel , as does the fact that the stop start system will actually stop the engine when you're coming to a standstill . So he doesn't wait for you to actually stop . It senses you're slowing down , and it just cuts the engine . This particular car is the three liter V six days or it's got 286 horsepower north , sixth day in around 5.7 seconds . And it's a really nice , smooth , strong engine , so there's layers of pulling power definitely suits this car very well . You can also get it from launch with a three liter V six Twin turbo petrol , which has more horsepower but less talk so it doesn't suit it . What as well as this engine A4 mpg is apparently possible . Interesting thing is that when you have this current dynamic mode hit out noise , I'm sure it's playing fake engine zone through the speakers and I don't like it . Things will rattle either , but I hate those fake engine sounds in terms of the rest of the driving experience .",noise,things rattle,neu
