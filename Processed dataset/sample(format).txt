One of the best advantages about this specific speck is these bad boys here , the paddles , the s tronic gearbox .

Three . You sit a lot lower and the center a lot more hugging , which is really , really nice . And the one favorite bit is how high the sense of concern is . And I think that comes with a lot of supercars , especially the Lamborghini Gallardo . They start in the center console on this bit , is really high and makes a really nice arm rest . Ah , nde . Unlike the R8 , you don't actually have to compromise using one of your cup holders to use it as an arm rest . If you remember my cup holders in the R8 right down the middle , you he's using his cup holders or used it as an arm rest . You can use it but this has a cup holder on isn't compromised when I put my arm there .#### #### ####[([9], [4, 5, 12, 13], 'POS'), ([9], [17, 17, 20], 'POS'), ([9, 57], [17, 29], 'POS'), ([91, 138], [140, 86], 'NEU')]
Welcome back to Super Carriage option on today . Guys own back in Belgium ours after a long , long time since our last visit . I think it's Bean . Just over a year . Last time I came here , I was in a film oven Audi A one or an M to four years . It has been quite a while . Obviously . It's time returning with my Audi s one on . I've actually come up here to talk to you guys about the first month of ownership of the Audi X1 since it's actually being over a month . As a matter of fact , it's never been six weeks , which has completely flown by Andi . I can't believe I've still got this car . Nevertheless , to this day still , I have the Audi X1 . I fully enjoyed it . There is nothing I would ever put against the ish Just such a magnificent car . I do also believe it's actually better than Audi .

It didn't want me to do electric , only driving . It wanted me to use the petrol engine , which it suddenly did . So this is what a lot of proper blokes like these cars , these fairly small but BMW . But we're quite large engines because they've got a lot of Polk . They've got a lot of low in grunt . They've got a lot of month , all those sort of things . Now that is a very bad way of describing . That is , what I'm doing is adopting , for those of you outside the UK essentially a slightly working class British accent . When I do that , I'm gonna do it again . They've got a lot of grudge .#### #### ####[([42], [39, 40], 'NEU'), ([48], [46, 47], 'POS')]

I thought they might have put in something that was a little bit more of driver focused , however , Audi adopted with their eight speed auto as you've seen dealing with it very nicely indeed , it's not my preference , but ultimately 95% of the time , you're not gonna find yourself lucky enough to be on roads like this . I've gone very much out of my way to hunt down these magnificent , basically like Spanish Alps just to test out the dynamics off this car that gave oxidants if a beat I was very much on . It changed when I wanted to . It's not a razor sharp shift , but the number one thing . And this is what I care about the most . It changes down exactly when you want to change down . Now I haven't driven this car in the water at all , but I don't need thio . I know Audi Z8 Speed auto is beautifully for just daily ing around in automatic . I want to know what this thing is like when you put it into dynamic . Is it dynamic ? Isn't RS4 box Yes , it's It does hit the spot and importantly , Okay , it takes the box or down , changing exactly what you wanted to , but it doesn't quite have that super crisp slamming at home like you would do from your clutch . But then again , this isn't it . All right , it's and RS4 in smiles per gallon so far disproportionately high . You know , for me , a soon as you step out of the realms of a car . For practical reasons , smiles is massive , you know , having a good time and it being dynamically capable . So you can thread it through roads like this that might present themselves . Or , if you know , you might have a really boring drive home from work . When you have that one country road that you look forward to every morning and every evening , if that car helps you maximize the potential of any given road , your wedding , you know , and you've seen it firsthand . We just nailed that road .

As I review , I think I nailed it . I think I have just one word I love how this Carlos I remember seeing this car get launched at the Motor Show was like BMW making that car , and I can imagine a mass audience that saw BMW A8 for the first time at the Motor Show . I thought that it was a concept car . Didn't think that it was actually gonna be seen on the road . And that's maybe why people's drawers are on the floor when I drive past , because that's to cancel the show . And that's the concept that what's it doing on the road ? And I think that's where people saw really get gobsmacked as seeing this car being hold on a minute . Wait , the car . That's I think that's that's where is on . I think . I hope I have noted it , nailed it because even in London that I get so many looks . I see a lot of eyes in London .#### #### ####[([171], [121, 27, 125], 'POS')]
You could really lean on it through the corners . It's completely unintimidating , and it's got quite good feedback as well . I just wish it had a bit more sparkle at those speeds , and it misses some of the boys of the RS4 practicality for two door keep .#### #### ####[([19], [17, 18], 'POS'), ([46], [38, 39], 'NEG')]
