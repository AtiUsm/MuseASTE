But so then , as you can probably imagine , judging by the trim levels there , there are two different engines set ups available for the X seven first , one being the three litre , twin power turbocharged inline six cylinder that is gonna belong to the extra F40 I that we have today . That one puts out 335I horsepower 5500 rpm and 330I pound feet of torque available at 1500 rpm . Power is going to be sent to all four wheels through BMW ex drive . All wheel drive system . That power is sent of ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which we will test out a little bit . Here , 0 to 60 time BMW puts it out approximately 5.8 seconds , with mpg numbers coming in a 20 in the city , 25 on the highway , and the X seven will give you an auto start . Stop system is well , so when you're stopped , a stops on or red light S7 will turn off automatically for you . Saving a little mpg is there as well , but the other engines set up along into the extra 50 I that is going to be a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged V8 , this one putting out 456 horsepower around 5200 rpm , £479 feet of torque available at 1500 rpm again sent all four wheels to an eight speed automatic .

I did want to mention there are some Dr moves located just behind the shifter there , and they're going to include ICO pro comfort sport and adaptive , which is really where the car decides what driving mood is best for your particular situation . But they're going to just things like the shift points . The Ronald response and the steering sensitivity is , Well , it's so .

The Range Rover and Land Rover , maybe even the Jeep Grand Cherokee have a heritage of going off road . This , of course , has a heritage of on road driving . But if you happen to have a cabin in the woods and it gets a little dusty and muddy , you shouldn't have any problems . Or if you're the mountains and you hit a snowstorm or to this car will do just fine . So keep in mind that if you do want to go seriously off road , maybe you want to stick the German cars .#### #### ####[([141], [8, 110, 154, 155], 'POS'), ([161], [173, 174], 'POS')]

all right . Hey , everybody . My car was in for repairs earlier this week , and the dealer gave me a loader car . BMW X1 And I've never driven one before , eh ? So I thought it would be fun to do a little mini review of my thoughts on the car . So I want to talk about the exterior of the interior , just what the experience was like and whether or not I give it a thumbs up or not . Um so the X1 is BMW entry level SUV .#### #### ####[([27], [26, 94, 95, 96], 'NEU')]

something of the bass . It's licorice , all sorts about BMW Z8 cars and that you never quite know what you're gonna get if you look back through the years , Zedd one said . Three , he said . Four , Said A8 . You find a roster of cars , which are mostly but perhaps not entirely , sports cars , mostly , but perhaps not entirely roadsters , mostly , but not entirely pretty small on fairly affordable . But that certainly shared an unconventional sporting character , which made every one of them memorable and different . If you like this video , don't forget , like M6 , Z4 in particular , has pulled a consistency to that said car line up over the last 10 or 12 years that has never really known before . Now this is the third generation version of that A4 inland Broken line . Like the last two , it's costal R8 trois come to the choices in line A4 A6 under engines on Line two . On the same , the incoming players just secrets . They may have seen Mr Breuer riding around in that aforementioned I quite liked it so well . It's a car with plenty of promising stunts . Headline A6 500E F40 . It's a little bit heavier than the outgoing G5 but it's got a low center of gravity , slightly short wheelbase wide tracks . All of that should pretty well for the way I am . It's got 10% more power , 20% more talk in the old car that's got a decent specifications .#### #### ####[([172, 218, 219], [225], 'NEU'), ([241], [239, 240], 'NEU'), ([243], [242], 'POS'), ([261], [259, 260], 'POS'), ([274], [273], 'POS')]

Back to the batteries are the breaks as you break . And then if you actually properly break my breast in the pedal , that's when he gets a bit weird , because it feels a bit unnatural .

The steering is absolutely brimming with feedback . It feels like a completely different car compared to a standard e class from the period . Now , the four speed automatic transmission is a little bit dull witted , but once you found the engine up , it still feels properly fast . This was the first Mercedes-Benz fitted as standard with ASR traction control . Now , unfortunately , you can't turn it off , which does rather live in the amount of fun you could have on a nice open cornice driving the C . L s .

And seeing as I'm a sensible motoring journalist , I should assess how the cast actually drives after all , the old one was a bit of a disappointment in this department . So how about the new car ? Well on place report that it's much , much better . So I'm driving in Croatia , Some of the roads , they're pretty bad on dhe because doing an admirable job of smoothing out some of the bums . Now I should point out that this being the 18 fifties has a more sophisticated rear independent suspension system In the letter cars that have a torch on beam and that's a bit like this car's rear suspension is champagne . Where's the lesser models ? Is more like Persico . Also , you can get all models with adaptive suspension so you can press a button and put them in comfort mode . Got this kind of comfort mode and , like I say , it rans off the edge of the bumps , it's Maur than added quote from being critical . Bigger bombs doing a bit of a jolt , and you do get a bit of noise . Committee of the cabin When he hits like a pothole up manhole cover , it doesn't seem to pummel the bumps in the road into submission like bigger Mercedes , but it's still break . It looks better over pubs in the old car . OK , then what happens when you reach a twisted right ? Well , I'm gonna put the car into sports mode now , so it's gonna wait to this steering , shopping the throttle response and stiffen up that suspension . Does it become a fun car , it seems to grip the road well enough on the steering puts it where you want it to bay . It definitely holds onto the road . Goes pretty good . Maybe , Maybe maybe it doesn't feel like it fits you like a glove . You know something like a box of golf . You just see more in tune with the car . This is almost like going running in someone else's running shoes . Taken , go quickly , but you don't want to push it to the max because you can't really tell what's going on beneath you as a result of the 18 fifties . Just not as much fun to drive as A8 Golf GT I , even though it's essentially supposed to be a whole attach .#### #### ####[([412], [46, 46, 49], 'POS'), ([53, 41, 173], [70], 'POS'), ([97], [93, 94], 'POS'), ([184, 173], [25, 26, 191], 'NEG'), ([200], [25, 26], 'NEG'), ([299], [40, 303], 'POS'), ([53], [113, 365, 29, 57, 369, 371], 'NEG')]
In terms of long distance driving , this car is generally quite comfortable . One thing I do notice , though , is that you do get quite a lot of noise from the tire , say competiton .

we know that the Mercedes SL s is a thing off deep , deep joy . We've run one for 10,000 miles this year , and we absolutely adore it .

But you can't wait . Now , though , it's time to find out what the Q3 is like to drive . So let's hit the road . So this Q3 DS . It's actually a fairly pleasant car to drive , so it does something that allowed is due where it goes about its business without too much fuss . It does everything rather well , but doesn't particular set the world alight , so the handling it sure footed it's grippy , especially this one got cultural will drive . Yeah , it goes with your pointing . You just don't feel too much of what's going on . But you don't really care , because the flip side of that is that you don't feel too much of what's going on when you're driving around town . It's all nice and easy .

Hello . Excuse me for one minute while I indulge myself just where I am two weeks on Christmas . I flew this morning to Malaga in southern Spain . Tow hop in the brand new Audi RS4 and the roads are phenomenal . What I didn't mention was when I left England , it was snowing anyway . Welcome a very special moment indeed . We are back with Audi . Now listen , this is totally unintentional . I know the channel has been very Audi heavy lately . It's just the way it's landed . Regardless , this is a big moment now A4 Audi fans and particularly for RS aficionados . The RS4 , I believe , has always had a very special place in Audi history . Now a little bit about the lineage and wise of old recently within now the themselves . I want you so far as to say that Cuatro has gone . But in days gone by , Cuatro was always the stamp off performance from Audi . But however , in recent years Audi has gone through somewhat of a rebrand , and now basically anything that comes out of Audi that is fast eyes under the name of Audi . Sports quarter , of course , still exists in its fantastic all wheel drive system .

The last thing I wanted to mention is when you do put the 2019 X5 in reverse , a rear view camera will come standard , letting you know who or what is behind you so you don't running anything or anyone over which is always is going to leave me into safety instead . To start , there are front , side and side curtain airbags . Also in the back latch . Take a lower anchors and others for children for the rear car seats . Also back their rear child door locks along with rain sensing windshield wipers , meaning you don't actually have to touch the windshield wiper adjustments .

Let's be honest . No , copays aren't about practicality . They drive is important . Like I said , it's beginning this video . The A5 is essentially an A4 in a different outfit on , and it has slightly stiffer suspension , and it makes it feel more sporty and also makes it feel a little bit more uncomfortable over bums . Now you can get this car with three different settings . Normal suspension or sport suspension , which is low in Stepford . Still on make the car more bouncy , or the best bear is the optional adaptive dampers , which have a comfort mo for cruising about Onda sports mode , which stiffens things up when you want to throw the car down a twisty road , and it's leading so much in the corners . This car is front wheel drive , whereas something like a bearded Z4 series or Mercedes C class on normally really drive . Now , put this into perspective for you . A Volkswagen Polo is front wheel drive . A Formula One car is really wheel drive , so yeah , enough said . Really , now you can Of course , get this idea with cultural will drive , and that gives you more grip . But it does make it handle slightly better , but still , overall , I don't think this A5 is as much fun to drive as its German rivals . It's all right , Audi . It's just no . One thing I can't complain about .
