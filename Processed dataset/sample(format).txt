Three . You sit a lot lower and the center a lot more hugging , which is really , really nice . And the one favorite bit is how high the sense of concern is . And I think that comes with a lot of supercars , especially the Lamborghini Gallardo . They start in the center console on this bit , is really high and makes a really nice arm rest . Ah , nde . Unlike the R8 , you don't actually have to compromise using one of your cup holders to use it as an arm rest .

I've actually come up here to talk to you guys about the first month of ownership of the Audi X1 since it's actually being over a month . As a matter of fact , it's never been six weeks , which has completely flown by Andi . I can't believe I've still got this car . Nevertheless , to this day still , I have the Audi X1 .

It didn't want me to do electric , only driving . It wanted me to use the petrol engine , which it suddenly did . So this is what a lot of proper blokes like these cars , these fairly small but BMW . But we're quite large engines because they've got a lot of Polk . They've got a lot of low in grunt . They've got a lot of month , all those sort of things . Now that is a very bad way of describing . That is , what I'm doing is adopting , for those of you outside the UK essentially a slightly working class British accent .

I thought they might have put in something that was a little bit more of driver focused , however , Audi adopted with their eight speed auto as you've seen dealing with it very nicely indeed , it's not my preference , but ultimately 95% of the time , you're not gonna find yourself lucky enough to be on roads like this . I've gone very much out of my way to hunt down these magnificent , basically like Spanish Alps just to test out the dynamics off this car that gave oxidants if a beat I was very much on . It changed when I wanted to . It's not a razor sharp shift , but the number one thing . And this is what I care about the most . It changes down exactly when you want to change down . Now I haven't driven this car in the water at all , but I don't need thio . I know Audi Z8 Speed auto is beautifully for just daily ing around in automatic . I want to know what this thing is like when you put it into dynamic . Is it dynamic ? Isn't RS4 box Yes , it's It does hit the spot and importantly , Okay , it takes the box or down , changing exactly what you wanted to , but it doesn't quite have that super crisp slamming at home like you would do from your clutch . But then again , this isn't it . All right , it's and RS4 in smiles per gallon so far disproportionately high . You know , for me , a soon as you step out of the realms of a car . For practical reasons , smiles is massive , you know , having a good time and it being dynamically capable . So you can thread it through roads like this that might present themselves . Or , if you know , you might have a really boring drive home from work . When you have that one country road that you look forward to every morning and every evening , if that car helps you maximize the potential of any given road , your wedding , you know , and you've seen it firsthand .

As I review , I think I nailed it . I think I have just one word I love how this Carlos I remember seeing this car get launched at the Motor Show was like BMW making that car , and I can imagine a mass audience that saw BMW A8 for the first time at the Motor Show . I thought that it was a concept car . Didn't think that it was actually gonna be seen on the road . And that's maybe why people's drawers are on the floor when I drive past , because that's to cancel the show . And that's the concept that what's it doing on the road ? And I think that's where people saw really get gobsmacked as seeing this car being hold on a minute . Wait , the car . That's I think that's that's where is on . I think . I hope I have noted it , nailed it because even in London that I get so many looks . I see a lot of eyes in London .#### #### ####[([171], [121, 27, 125], 'POS')]

Another thing is that while the visibility at the front and the back is actually very good is easy to place the car .
