Another thing this car has is mold hybrid technology . So you've got a 48 volt battery fit into this thing on it allows it to coast . So when you on the motorway , you can lift off the throttle on this thing , we're pretty much free wheel . It d couples the engine from the wheels on you just roll along on that helps save fuel , as does the fact that the stop start system will actually stop the engine when you're coming to a standstill . So he doesn't wait for you to actually stop . It senses you're slowing down , and it just cuts the engine . This particular car is the three liter V six days or it's got 286 horsepower north , sixth day in around 5.7 seconds . And it's a really nice , smooth , strong engine , so there's layers of pulling power definitely suits this car very well . You can also get it from launch with a three liter V six Twin turbo petrol , which has more horsepower but less talk so it doesn't suit it .

In fact , I might have to slow down , stop and show you what's what it's all to do with the EM drive system because you've now got two buttons which changed not only the characteristics within the steering , but also the dampers and the throttle response on gear change speed as well .

But I'm coming around to the Mercedes AMG GT s . I have got a real soft spot for the A class . The new Mercedes A class , if you remember back potentially 2000 for 2005 Mercedes . We're bringing out the God awful at a class really high on it . Just looked . It didn't look very sporting . It was a family car on Mercedes is I did that . They wanted to move the class to a big glass , which then left a gap to try and target the younger audience . Which brought this the Mercedes A class hash . But the new Mercedes A class that came out It was aimed at the younger generation and it captivated me back when I was looking at my first car . I actually place an order for a brand new Mercedes A class 1 80 It was the cheapest model , but I just loved it . I loved the interior . I thought that it was really classy for you , for what you got for your money . It was a really , really cool car on , unfortunately at to cancel the order because it got delayed on . Then I went on board my 2007 Fox last year . S6 I . So I've got a bit of a ongoing relationship with the Mercedes A class so actually get behind this car . It seems relatively familiar , but there's still lots and lots of exploring to do , which I thoroughly enjoyed over the last a few days driving into the courts worlds are definitely played around with comfort sport sport .#### #### ####[([6], [4], 'POS'), ([6], [74], 'POS'), ([177], [132, 56, 43, 135], 'POS'), ([177], [127, 128], 'POS'), ([143], [142], 'POS'), ([177], [169, 204, 205, 206], 'NEG'), ([190], [188], 'POS')]

The first thing to note about this G class is that it's a very tall car , so it's a bit of a show that it doesn't have a grab handle . They like the rest of these to help you get in , because you have to kind of all yourself like that using the wheel . Thankfully , there is a grab handle , like in the old G wagon for your passenger . Not really need .

Now , in terms of boot space , the capacity is on a par with its German rivals . When you got the seats in the normal configuration , you also stand to get a automated tailgate . You may like that , or you may know it depends on your point of view . So the bitch itself is a nice square shape , but it's not 100% perfect . For instance , there is a little ridge to lift stuff over . It's not too bad , but other cars like this you can slide him straight out . There is no lip . Also icon for the life of me find a 12 volt socket in here , a standard . There are various tethering points here and here under this floor . Yes , there's not much room for anything else . We've got all the gubbins for the puncture repair kit now . Like I said earlier , this one has the upgraded rear seats on , as well as being all to move forwards and backwards actually moving forward . You increase the boots capacity by around affair . You can fold them down individually . So look , you can fall down the middle one on this other car . You can't do that and you can fool the others using these levers . The only problem is as you can see they don't actually fall down very well on their own accord . So you have to Kevin , do it yourself . I want you moving down . You kind of got a almost continuous load space there . It's a little bit of a fact . You don't expect that from an Audi , do you ?

It has an extra features over the basic version . So you got traffic updates , which is good as ways really rooting around . The traffic jams really like those the Internet connectivity . I've also got concierge service . I can speak to a man over the phone and he'll actually book hotels . For me , it's really , really good . In fact , I love this system is intuitive , simple to use . You could just wish through all the menus very easily , and you can operate it using this swivel wheel here in the shortcut buttons .

Now , normally , at this part of the review , we talk about hydrocarbons gasoline . But now we don't get to talk about electrons because , well , let's talk about the gas part .

That's dual clutching Audi speak , and Audi says it goes from 0 to 60 and 5.2 seconds . The A6 doesn't in 5.1 because £100 lighter . But let me show you something interesting . I think it's right here . It's this red cable . And that's because this is also a mild 48 volt hybrid , which allows this car to do things like turn this gasoline engine off 15 miles and hour , which is right before you get to the stop sign so that it gets a 25 mpg combined , which is actually to better in the old cars 23 .

You know what started off just with a bit of a downer about this car ? Because it felt a bit . It felt a bit naughty and a bit dishonest to use a sports cars identity , you know , celebrate sort of what amounts to a big super saloon , really kind of figure . It could never be good enough to drive to live up to that , and it's not a sports car , but for a two ton four seater . It's pretty great , You know , this thing does all the basics .

There's a lot of sub menus at the end of the day , it's very functional . It very complicated . This is a system that is not incredibly intuitive . If you buy this car , I'm willing to bet that you're gonna have to break out the owner's manual when you want to do very simple things , like program your favorite stations . And that's an issue . I love the fact that Germans built a lot of functionality into everything they do . It's all very logical . It's all very straightforward .

As you can see , if you want to carry items in the boot and I need a bit more space , you can ask your rear passengers sit more of pride because it does increase the low capacity . But people really don't wanna travel like that . Aren't they really , she carrying really large items you're gonna need to fold the seats down and to do it . A two stage process , which is a bit of a fast these days for these seat backs . They do lie flat . The problem is that you have this huge ridge here . Now it's gonna be really hard to push heavy items right to the front of the car . Now let's talk about the actual boot space , so this door opens sideways , so it's really awkward to do in tight spaces . Also , it's really heavy because you got that spare with on the back of this There , you got the quilting here . That's really nice now . What's not so nice , though , is the fact that you really do have to kind of lift things up quite a way to get them into this . Because unlike a Range Rover , there's no air suspension , so you can't lower the car down to make that easier . Also , the tow hitch it's fixed . It's not retractable once again , like it's retractable on a Range Rover that we can still toe the same 3.5 tons . This car's that's pretty good , but also pretty good is that there's no lower lip . So once you've got things appear , there is enough to slide in on this very tender points around the place . You got 12 volt socket here as well . You've also got a boot liner there to keep it nice and clean . Z8 don't dirty the carpet . Unfortunately , under there , there's no extra storage , which is annoying because really , you could do is somewhere to put the removable parcel shelf . So now it's just kind of lay like that . Maybe I see what's going on because I want to show you the boot size yet . It's very big , but it's not quite as big as a Porsche Cayenne . You might be wondering what the heck this bag is .

However , you do get so much more . Performance Power comes from a 4.4 litre twin turbo V8 with 600 horsepower and 750 Newton meters of talk , which is impressive , though not quite as impressive as Mercedes-Benz V8 , which has 610 horsepower and 850 Newton meters . Still , this BMW is available with this rather lovely optional carbon fiber engine cover . I think I might just have that and see him something . Get it on eBay . Wonderful notices gone . The standard fit rear end differential could move power about between the back wheels descended the wheel with the most grip for improved corner exiting traction . Now , while the old M5 years a deal clutch automatic gearbox , this one has an eight speed with a tall converter , which may make it seem about as modern as this mountain bike . But the reason they've gone for a talk converter is that it's smoother , and it's strong enough to cope with this car's extra talk . The engine has a special high pressure oil system , which works in high G conditions . So when you're calling really faster that you don't get oil starvation and damaged the engine , you better put your cap back . Otherwise , I may actually damage the engine . When you start the M5 , it automatically has a sports exhaust in its and loudest setting , which is exactly what you wanted and after fat around , turning it on to make it sound as good as it can and will you rev it ?
