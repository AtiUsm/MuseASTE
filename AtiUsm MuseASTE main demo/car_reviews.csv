0,15,A5,"as Americans continue to fall out of love with full size . Sedan's midsize is air picking up the slack but closely mimicking their flagship kin . When it comes to well , pretty much everything . A5 Siri's is just another shining example of high end downsizing in Action wing , slightly less in the previous iteration , the newest five , Siri's looks like BMW .It's conservative shape might lack edge , but it should age wealth well , call it classy . Inside is a different story where , unlike previous generations , the interior actually looks and feels different . This is the modern interpretation of BMW classic aesthetic I'd always hoped for .And that stately character carries over to the driving experience because now the five series drives last like a larger A3 Siri's and more like a smaller seven . If your taste lean more to the luxury side of the spectrum , this isn't necessarily a bad thing . To be clear , the five still grips , breaks and accelerates like a proper BMW . It's just the sensations of doing so have been deluded to some degree . As a result , though , A5 delivers big on comfort , right quality is just a hair further than that of the Mercedes E class but still totally comfortable .Noise suppression is positively top notch .The turning radius is insanely tight , which I'm sure is largely attributed to the rear wheel steering .And the seats are fantastic , with more adjustment points than most people would know what to do with . If you can't find a position to accommodate your body type , find a new body type .That said , the steering wheel is laughably thick . Elsewhere in the cabin , you'll find sun visors that don't slide and instead hit you in the face . An instrument cluster that beautifully mixes physical and digital design elements and ruby rear seats .Oh , a huge center tunnel takes the shine off that center position behind affordable rear seats . A low , flat floor and vast 18.7 cubic foot capacity make for a supremely usable trying .At the front of the car sits an engine bay that could be filled with one of four powertrains . Nazi . There's a two litre , turbo charged , four cylinder , A3 liter turbocharged inline six A4 60.4 liter turbocharged V8 and a plug in hybrid that blends electric propulsion with a triple charged four cylinder engine to deliver swift acceleration in 16 miles , a pure electric range . Following seven hours of charging on a standard household outlet , we will drive a standard across the board with all wheel drive optional , accepting the all wheel drive only M5 50 I . Also standard is an eight speed automatic transmission and automatic engine stop start feature that saves fuel when the vehicle is motionless . It can also be turned off if you prefer .For those who like a customized driving experience , BMW five . Siri's offers various drive modes that operate exactly as you'd expect . No , it is worth mentioning that the ICO mode could be a surprisingly fun , and the sport mode is so dedicated . The sporting is it's actually able to tighten the front seat side bolsters and typical German fashion .BMW five series could be Spectra , a wide range of prices from slightly more than $52,000 well over $80,000 for a loaded in 5 50 i X Dr . For the moment , though , let's focus on the cheaper end of the spectrum or even a base 5 30 I include 16 way adjustable front seats , navigation with real time traffic , automatic brake cold , adaptive led headlights and a 12 speaker audio system though a backup camera inexplicably costs extra well , a basic five Syriza's a perfectly lovely conveyance .Pricier versions and the option sheet reveal a plethora of automotive delights . Standouts include ventilated , massaging front seats that keep you from getting store by nudging you around like one of those goofball for derides , a system that parks itself using the key FOB passive entry .Glorious sounding , premium audio systems ended , adaptive staring system that works well until it doesn't . We encountered a few instances where the system was behaving normally and surprise , it decided all on its own , and it just didn't wanna work anymore . And we ran into a chicken coop that it happened .But we could have if that doesn't turn you off . A5 . Siri's can also be equipped with additional advance safety technology like blind spot monitoring for collision warning with automatic braking and a side collision avoidance system that automatically steers you away from vehicles that drift into your lane . Like , for example , another five . Siri's equipped with adaptive steering , further personalized A5 .Siri's interior could be outfitted with numerous upholstery in trim themes , know whichever you choose real interior centerpieces .This I drive , which has been completely revamped and now features a large tiled main menu along with your sub menus . Overall , a touch screen in addition to the simplified remote gesture control , which I totally thought was a gimmick until it started using it .Now I can change tracks and adjust volume while looking like a crazy person to everyone around me .To the delight of the habitually tangled .I Drive also includes wireless Apple carplay that works in nearly as good as the tether solution , but it does cost $3 at the moment .BMW it has a review of plans . Dad , Android Auto . Hey , perhaps , um , unrelated technology and distracted from that fact .Coolest camera system ever .Yeah , what , he said .If you're thinking about buying a BMW five Siri's , you might also investigate the well rounded Audi A6 intensively , Sweetest of although S90 , where the resale value leading Lexus GS , each boasting a lower starting price in the five Siris . If , on the other hand , you're willing to spend slightly more , we're big fans of the Mercedes-Benz e class , which feels a lot like the flagship s class , but smaller .That concept sounds familiar , though it may not be is engaging in some of its early predecessors .A7 Generation five Siri's represents a huge leap forward in terms of technology and interior sophistication .With a pedigree spanning nearly four decades , it's refreshing to see a legacy nameplate embracing change for all the right reasons .Metallica ."
1,16,4 Series,"A8 seeing as the rest of BMW scoops have been assigned unique identities , it was only a matter of time before the three Siri's line followed suit . Enter the BMW four Siri's , the new name played under which the three Siri's coupe convertible and high performance M four variant will exist for the foreseeable future while sharing most major mechanicals and feature content with its four door counterparts , the new four Siri's takes on a character all its own , lower , longer and wider than his predecessor . Before Siri's puts amore aggressively sophisticated spin on classic BMW design .Styling cues consist of an elongated hood , specially designed fender vents that reduce drag in a sweeping roof line that flows into a short deck lid and near fastback fashion .This low slung stance also use the lowest centre of gravity of any vehicle in BMWs current lineup . All that , said the fours head turning exterior design is counteracted by its interior shortcomings .Cabin layout , well elegant and ergonomically sound is marked by a glaring absence of basic creature comforts . Chief among them are visors that don't extend lack of passive entry and a sink function for the dual zone climate control system . despite a starting president early $41,000 the entry level for 28 I still doesn't include a backup camera lumbar support for the driver's seat , where Bluetooth audio streaming a standard fare .To put our grievances into perspective , we're well aware of the fact that BMW built cars for profit . But nickel and dime ing car shoppers for common features is a strategy best left to exotic car makers .On a more positive note , the four Siri's holds a clear advantage over the competition . When it comes to driving dynamics , the suspension and chassis work together harmoniously to deliver the impeccably balance ride and handling package for which BMW is renowned when noise makes it self evident at highway speeds but overall ride qualities befitting of a car from the class above . On the track , our end sport equipped for 28 I performed . As expected , the brakes were easy to modulate and held up well , given the race type conditions , feedback and response from the electric assisted steering was also noticeably better than that of the Audi A5 Mercedes-Benz C class coupe . Though it took some effort detained the fourth inclination towards understeer .The brighter side of the force . Siri's saga continues into the real world , where a larger cargo area than the A5 C Class and Infinity Q 60 offers the freedom to store whatever it is people toss in the trunks these days .The rear seat is comparatively spacious as well , and the front quarters provide ample headroom for taller drivers . Me not being one of them .Under the hood , you'll find the same engine and transmission compasses before rear drive for 28 all wheel drive for 28 x DR . Employ a two litre , 240 horsepower turbo charged four cylinder , while A4 , 35 4 35 x Dr Pak BMW is now ubiquitous . 300 horsepower A3 liter turbocharged inline six Either can be paired with the standard eight speed automatic or no cost . Optional six speed manual efficiency figures are all over the map , ranging from around 20 mpg in the city to around 35 mpg on the highway . It's also worth noting that we were able to exceed our test cars 35 mpg highway rating by three marks , with help from an ICO drive mode that actually saves fuel . Which brings us back to the matter of value for money .Add in most of the features one would expect to come . Standard in the sticker price rises to roughly $46,000 . Tack on premium options like a head up display , led headlights , adaptive suspension and a heated steering wheel . And you're looking at more than $50,000 for a fully option for 28 I Mercedes-Benz C Class coupe , Audi A5 and Cadillacs C . T s coupe offer more features for dollar , along with a sub $40,000 starting price .Those in the market for a well equipped for 35 . I might also want to consider stepping up to the market Lee more upscale Mercedes-Benz E class coupe , but a value ranks near the bottom of your purchasing priorities are V8 from us to disapprove of the BMW four .Siri's"
2,17,X3,"This is third generation X3 BMW compact SUV that slots between the X1 and X two and explore and X5 . You know , if the motor works , folks in Bavaria come out with any more small models . They're gonna have to go to the decimal system . You know , they run out of numbers on this X3 .The exterior now has a sporting or look for all of those off road activities it will presumably be doing or , more likely , aggressive parking maneuvers in the Bloomingdale's parking lot . The roof is lower , creating a more athletic line from the front axle to the a pillar . The front facial features a longer three dimensional kidney grille with new headlights and running lights at the rear . Our new tail lights , twin exhaust pipes and a downward sloping roof spoiler that cumulatively add to the vehicle's overall , more aggressive and , yes , muscular , mean the X rays . Interior fit and finishes are expected . Lila Jury , ISS piano Black is nice , like , you know it's fake . I kind of dig . This would finish . But you know , there's badging everywhere . It's there , and it's there and it's there and it's there , you know , just in case you've forgotten what your driving's there , there Theo dashes , dramatically sparse but elegant , with a well thought out center stack starring the touchscreen display . But there are enough buttons to strike a nice balance between high and low tech .Good use is made of the center console . This might be the most integrated cupholders we've seen in a while .Below Dash makes the cab feel brighter and improves visibility .The larger head up display you get with the premium package is the same version used in the seven Siri's , as is the optional digital gauge cluster just beyond the sport steering wheel .The seats are firm , but I like how they feel , even if they're a little lacking in these snazzy looks department . No fancy Mercedes wilting in here leg room in the second row is okay if you're behind me , same as head room , but a larger person , either in front or in back might have issues . The middle seat isn't really one again .Depending on your size and the length of the trip , your stuff might be more comfortable because there's 29 cubic feet behind the rear seat , compared to 26.8 in the Audi Q5 19 behind the Mercedes GLC and 17.7 in the portion Makhan .Nice acoustics inside the cabin are much improved over the previous generation . Well controlled wind and city noise makes for a really pleasant interior experience .Okay , now let's see how it really drives .There's virtually zero lag from the twin turbo , two liter inline four that powers the X3 and shifts on the excellent eight speed automatic transmission are expeditious and well spaced , even in comfort mode . Flip it into sport and things become a little bit more interesting . The gears air held longer and the acceleration is more immediate . Things get a lot more BMW . I want more control and quick acceleration . Situations simply hit .These ride feels well , except for the fact that I'm sitting up high doesn't really feel like a SUV . It feels more sedan like chassis is rigid but firm in all the right moment , and the suspension is rigid but comfortable . It really strikes a nice balance . It's a jumped herbal , so totally making that a word steering has a nice resistance in my hands . It's responsive , and it's quick . It's kind of like Goldie Locks in this car . It's a really great driver . Both rear and all wheel drive options are available on the X3 .Personally , I'd pony up the extra $2000 for the X Drive system , with its enhanced traction handling and off road capabilities .I know not many of these things are gonna get dirty , but they should , huh ?Base price on the rear wheel drive model starts around $42,000 including destination doing basic math . That's $44,000 for all wheel drive if performance is what you're after .The X3 also comes in a nearly $12,000 pricier M line performance edition that both larger intakes , side skirt trim and a diffuser style rear apron , all of which are designed to improve downforce .It's powered by BMW twin powered , turbo charged three liter inline six . That makes it pretty beefed up numbers . Fuel economy numbers for the to leader X try Vir in line with segment . The M 40 I numbers are expectedly smaller , but not by much .Adding the M performance version was an a plus move in our book , considering the X3 competition reads like a who's who of first world problems , some of whom offer legitimate high performance track where the options portion Makhan with the performance package . Audi S Q5 , the Mercedes-Benz AM GLC 43 63 the Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadra Folio . Also vying for your luxury SUV allowance . R Jag U Ars F aced Lexus and X Range Rovers , Volare , Accurate RDX and the Volvo XC60 . It's a pool party and everyone is invited .The options sheet for the X3 reads like a New Yorker article . Prolific dynamic handling package includes variable sport steering and sport breaks and dynamic damper control for improved ride quality .19 inch wheels come standard , though you can opt for twenties or 20 ones .The driving assistance plus package gets safety tech for those who like the idea of not crashing with features including active cruise control lane keeping assists with side collision avoidance , front cross traffic alerts and traffic jam ist ist apple Carplay is a $300 option .Well , because it's wireless , which we actually like , and we can't wait until this is an option that's free and every car . Android auto is a no dollar option because it's not offered . Okay , it's not yet .This model were testing comes with all of those available packages and also comes with a sticker price of about $57,700 .With rising consumer interest in SUVs and a fierce competitive set theme , W needs the latest X3 to represent them well . And it does . Sure , you can find a well equipped luxury SUV at a lower price point . But if you're looking for a luxurious German import , that's really satisfying to drive well , this X mark the spot ."
3,18,i8,"Ever since the Z8 roadster waved its final goodbye in 2003 sports car enthusiast have been patiently awaiting the arrival of BMW is next performance . Halo Car . The German automaker could have played it safe and developed another no holds bar supercar like the Audi R8 Lexus L affair Mercedes-Benz s a less but instead BMW double dad on their efficient dynamics engineering philosophy and produce this A8 looking like something straight out of an ad sponsored sci fi film . The main story Behind the eye . It comes down to 24 thinking technologies , a lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic body and a sophisticated plug in hybrid powertrain . Holding it all together is an aluminum drive module , which is simply BMW's fancy way of saying chassis .Completing this oven guard formula are vertical opening scissor doors because nothing says progressive .Like a 40 year old concept , the eye A8 doesn't look futuristic just for the sake of it . Virtually every design element serves a purpose , like this functional hood vent Ah , front apron port that creates an air curtain around the front wheels to help reduce drag . A rear intake channel , it provides air to the three cylinder gas engine and this rear balance that well , I think that's just for show .Inside high quality reusable materials intertwined with clear contrasts and blue accents to form the most contemporary representation of BMW is current design . Aesthetic shell type front seats and chemically hardened glass further emphasize the eye . It's lightweight nature , but as a great man , never said with great weight savings come great responsibility .Not surprisingly , the eye it is in the most practical car on the road .The rear seats aren't suitable for anyone other than small children and skilled contortionists and cargo space consists of those two seats and the small cubby hole back here .That's it .By the same token , the weight conscious front seats offer only six way adjustability lumbar support , not being one of them . Then again , most consumers in the market for $137,000 sports car have alternative forms of transportation at their disposal , making the matter of everyday versatility a non issue .Changing her focus to the realm for which it was designed by A8 accelerates and handles a BMW should exceptionally composed at high speeds , the eye A8 also carves the corners with a surgeon's precision . This stereo system is truly unique in that it's quite possibly the only electric assistant set up that elicits no criticisms for me regarding feedback are waiting . I think it's fair to say BMW has officially cracked the code on electric steering . Brace yourselves . The Iet's electromechanical steering is so responsive and effortless that hydraulically actuated set up what actually detract from the experience . Deep breaths .In terms of running gear , the eye A8 pairs an internal combustion engine that drives the rear wheels with an electric motor generator unit energized by a lithium ion battery that powers the front wheels . Combined output is 357 horsepower in £420 feet of torque for claim , 0 to 60 time of 4.2 seconds . Better yet , BMW tune the exhaust note of the turbo charged three cylinder engine to admit the baritone Barkalow V8 . Sure , you could have had a V8 , but this is better for a number of reasons , the first being efficiency . Following a 3.5 hour charge on a standard 110 volt household outlet , 1.5 hours with a 220 volt charging station , V8 can travel roughly 22 miles on electricity alone at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour before the conventional engine kicks in to deliver an extra 300 miles of range . We logged 18 miles of all electric driving in real world conditions , meaning the eye . It delivers the straight line acceleration of a BMW m four with the efficiency of a Ford C . Max Energi . No , not at the same time powers ratted to the front wheels , rear wheels or anywhere in between through a hyper intelligent own wheel drive system made it to a lightweight six speed automatic transmission . All told , the BMW A8 weighs in at less than £3300 nearly £200 lighter than the Audi R8 .Over 80% of BMW dealerships in the U . S will sell and service the eye A8 . As for pricing BMW , I A8 opens it writer on $137,000 not including up to $5000 in state and federal tax rebates .Standard features include a Harman Kardon premium sound system , 20 inch wheels led headlights , navigation with real time traffic overlays , rain sensing windshield wipers , adaptive cruise control and a head up display .Most options . Air of the cosmetic variety consist of blue seat belt straps , perforated leather and exclusive into your colors like spice grey dot Burgio brown and ivory . White . High rollers can also order a set of custom crafted Louis Vuitton luggage for the totally reasonable price of just $26,000 .You can't make this stuff up wave to the people . Of course , this price point offers no shortage of alternatives . Those looking for a bar room numbers generator will likely gravitate towards the Audi R8 Mercedes-Benz SL 63 AMG . While affluent types in need of a green machine with a usable backseat might express a preference for the Porsche Panamera s E hybrid . You can also take home an all electric Tesla model s and a Cadillac hell are plug in hybrid for about the same prices in I A8 as to meet vehicles combined into one .The I A8 clearly isn't for everyone , but it does go to show that environmentally friendly vehicles won't spell the end of performance cars . So if this is what the future has in store for us , sign me up"
4,19,M2,"after nearly five years , the long awaited successor to the BMW one M5 Aina Lee here . So without further ado , let's get acquainted with the new M to first and foremost look .Besides expected end arrive front and rear fishes , fender adornments , quad exhaust tips . The M two features an aluminum intensive body structure that's nearly three inches wider than the standard to Siri's .As for the engine , BMW didn't just take a reworked version of his existing three litre turbo and stick it into a racy or to Siri's . Okay , that's actually exactly what they did . But this engine , housed within a modified M3 chassis . Yes , the End , too , is only a two Siri's to the naked eye , and the result is really something special . So to find out just how special it is , let's head to the race track way . Of course , the first thing you'll notice power and with 365 horsepower £343 feet of torque for a 0 to 60 in 4.2 seconds , there's certainly no lack of it begins to produce usable power around 3500 rpm . Wait till dessert all way up until just over 7000 rpm . Let's give that a try .I like to put it another way . If you miss a shift , you mess up 1/4 you're in the wrong gear . It's really not gonna matter to has enough torque to pull you out of it thing . Kara Scene Well over 50 consecutive laughter . Goodness taker Raceway , but break still feel really good ? No signs of fading , A bit of squeaking here and there , but that's to be expected , but the journal is behind the wheel . And , of course , the way the chassis and suspension work together is something magical . Make our way through the courts . Crew here turn in no delay . Half throttle on it is extremely predictable .Unfortunately , we do have very limited time on the racetrack , but still the end to performs on the street .Yeah , Once you return to the place where most M twos will spend their entire lives , you'll be greeted with a really pleasant driving experience . The cabin is fairly quiet until your right foot gets the upper hand .Seats are comfortable and supportive . These when you offer the power seat option because , yes , a car with a 52,000 starting price does not come with power seats .Steering wheel offers Maura just ability than most of you will ever need .But the most impressive aspect of the M two's urban saga is just how comfortable the right is , given how capable it is on a race track .Really , the only criticism I have is the rather unrefined nature of the optional seven speed , double clutch automatic transmission . You accelerate from the stop , especially when the transmission is cold way . That's A7 speed is absolutely brilliant . On the race track , there's virtually zero lag time from the moment you depress the paddle shifter in the gear change occurs , you can actually feel a little bit of partial engagement as you return to throttle . It's pretty neat for something that doesn't have a traditional clutch and again way are quite taken with the six speed manual driving right now has short throws . Its Responsive has an auto rib match feature . The clutch is light and really easy to use , one to get along with really good steering .What's the biggest advantage I am too ? Has over , rivals say , like the Audi S3 and Mercedes-Benz Seal A 45 . This is a lot more , although that you need a rocket ship . Refined nature , for which BMW cars renowned has diminished slightly over the years . It's safe to say the M two signifies a return to glory BMW Performance Wing Hey !"
5,20,X2,"like higher Olympics , it's possible to decipher BMW Alfa numeric naming convention and means fast X means SUV . Odd numbers indicate four doors and even numbers are reserved for coops and coop like vehicles . This is the X to that . Even number two means that's right . It's a coupe like vehicle .No , the extra is clearly not a proper coop , but it is comparatively sporty versus the X1 SUV on which it's based . Sharing the X1 is wheelbase . The X two is lower and less lengthy .That condensed form factor might think interior space would suffer , and it does . But as a five foot 10 inch dude , I'm still able to sit behind my preferred front seating position without my knees touching the seat back . Thanks in part to this cutout design . The front seat also sits up a little bit high so I can slide my feet underneath for a little extra space . The seat backs recline a little bit , which is more comfortable , and my head clears the headliner . Not bad . I wouldn't want to sit in the middle spot for an extended trip , but otherwise the X two backseats arm or than endurable , provided you don't mind ducking to clear the dipping roof line .The same holds true when you peek behind the standard power tailgate . Did you have to clear this high lip ? But if you conquer that , you've got a sizable square space to work with . Supported by a super deep under floor storage area , my backpack almost fits under there . Almost .It sure would be nice if the rear seats could be lowered from the cargo area instead of having a walk around the side . And I wish that steering wheel lowered a bit further .But overall , the X two feels like a real BMW with pleasing materials , a stylish layout , nice faux leather upholstery and a standard 10 way power driver's seat with adjustable side bolsters or fancy or taste .The cabin could be updated with real leather , a 12 speaker Harman Kardon audio system , A5 $100 wireless charging nook and 8.8 inch navigation system , replacing the standard 6.5 inch display and Apple Carplay for $300 which might seem offensive since it's usually free .But in the BMW x two , it's wireless . Look , my car plays connected and there's no wires . When you combine that with the wireless phone charging , Ah , it's like I'm living in the future .Veering too superficial concerns . The BMW Ex two's prime directive is to look cool . So what do you think ? There is a historical basis for it , but we'd be tempted to remove the BMW badge on the Sea pillar if doing so was easy .Nonetheless , the X two has a squat , athletic vibe that we like that athleticism carries through to the ex two's driving to me . If you want to carry serious speed around your favorite corner , X ray deuce will oblige .Unfortunate nickname I came up with at higher speeds . Steering feels a little imprecise on center , and a touchy brake pedal demands finesse from the driver . But generally speaking , the X two is a pleasure to drive , provided your head is aimed that direction .If you turn over your shoulder , maybe when you're changing lanes or parking , the stylish roof line reveals itself through a massive blind spot .A standard backup camera and optional parking sensors help .But given the visibility issues , it's baffling that the X two cannot be equipped with blind spot warning . On a happier note , BMW does offer a $700 Driver Assistance package featuring Lane departure warning , forward collision warning and city collision mitigation braking with the $4600 M6 Port Ex packages , 19 inch wheels and 190.4 inch lower sports suspension Ride quality skews to the firm side of the spectrum .If ride comfort is your top priority , either stick with the Base X two or for $600 at the dynamic handling package with its adjustable dampers . And for those who love customizing their car's steering and powertrain behavior , Comfort , sport and efficiency enhancing ICO pro modes come standard . Front wheel drive is also standard , but for slippery environs or dainty off roading , all wheel drive is offered for $2000 . Co . Have an adventure , won't you ? Another handy option is dynamic cruise control with stop and go abilities . If you're a lazy , surly driver who doesn't feel like maintaining the pace of the vehicle ahead of you , it will do that automatically if it is equipped with that technology and this one is done .So I'm gonna crash in the back of that Honda pilot like it's X1 Kin . The X two comes with a single engine , a two litre turbo charged four cylinder matched to an eight speed automatic transmission that's controlled by a blessedly simple mechanical shift lever instead of the comparatively tricky Elektronik shifter found on most BMWs related . Note the automatic engine start stop system help save you when the vehicle is stopped . But if you find its operation intrusive , the off switch is conveniently placed right next to the start button in action . The two litre , eight speed automatic combination delivers refined operation . Brisk acceleration with 0 to 60 time , about six and 1/2 seconds despite some off the line turbo lag and good fuel economy .Keep in mind , BMW recommends premium fuel , but if you've got extra money , that shouldn't be a problem . On that note . The X two ain't cheap . Base front drive X two s drive . 28 . I starts around 37 a half $1000 including destination charges . Stretch your budget to the low to mid forties if you'd like a nicely equipped X two with all wheel drive among the ex twos . Less expensive small luxury SUV competitors are the Audi Q3 , Mercedes-Benz , G .L . A , Lincoln , M C . And Lexus and Ex Ignore them along with personal restraint , and you can spec a loaded , all wheel drive M6 port X6 to that cost $53,000 or so That price you could buy the much faster , much more powerful Mercedes-Benz G g l . A 45 or a decently equipped BMW X3 come to think of it so well , that option , she it responsibly . Better yet , explore kdb dot com to design the X two of your dreams . Plug among an increasing number of small luxury SUVs .There are more practical and cheaper choices .But if swapping little practicality to up your style game seems like a reasonable tradeoff , the being belle be x two is waiting ."
6,21,X1,"Is it possible to retain the essence of a luxury SUV if you compress it down to sub compact proportions ? Short answer . Yes . Long answer . That'll take a couple minutes slotting beneath the larger X3 and X5 . X1 is the smallest and cheapest member of BMW's SUV line .BMW X1 might be small , but its cargo area really isn't . The 27 cubic foot trunk is conveniently square , with a modest reach over haIf , and underneath this trifled cover , there's a handy under floor storage area where you can hide your stuff that you don't want other people looking at like that go pro faded for occasions where long items need to mingle with human cargo . F40 2040 split rear seats really come in handy for both your gear . Optional power releases Drop the back seats , revealing a fairly flat , surprisingly vast cargo hold .Meanwhile , storage nooks throughout , including this one beneath the driver's seat wrangle sundries X1 doesn't just excel it , carrying inanimate objects , passenger accommodations , air similarly impressive with the front seat set for my average frame . Leg room back here is great , enhanced by excellent foot space underneath the front seat the same time , headroom Similarly good . Heck , even with this hump in the middle here , the middle seat is perfectly inhabitable .Even better receive comfort . A sliding and reclining second row seat is available for $300 . Elsewhere , an adjustable center armrest adds a touch of storage base and ensures your elbows land at a comfortable height .General terms X1 interior absolutely falls in line with what you'd expect from a proper BMW , emerging high quality plastics and abundant soft materials with a stylish cabin layout .No , Perhaps the biggest question is whether the smaller and cheaper X1 drives like a real BMW . Once again , the answer is yes , provided you overlooking un BMW level of ponds under slack with steering . Otherwise , the X1 is as adept in the corners as it is slogging through traffic , moving in a sporty , pleasing fashion .It's definitely not the most fun BMW on the planet . But compared to other small luxury SUVs , the X1 is plenty thrilling to drive reverse abusively rough pavement , and he'll certainly field in the cabin .But from normal commuting the X1 Ryans fairly well where power is concerned , you have one choice just really like no choice at all . A two liter turbocharged engine paired with an eight speed automatic transmission .Thankfully , it's a winning combination , delivering swift acceleration , refined operation and good fuel economy .Our train isn't perfect , though , for the accelerator . From a stop , the engine takes a moment before the turbo spools up power kicks in . Also , the automatic engine start stop system might save fuel . When the vehicle to stop , we found the engine restarts to be jarring , you know , feel free to turn the system off . He promised not to judge you . The original BMW X1 offered of the six second generation doesn't two litre engine is plenty powerful for most drivers . Guild X1 also offered rear wheel drive . All the latest version , based on the front drive platform only comes with all wheel drive . All wheel drive definitely has its pluses when traction suffers , but it also raises the base price for customers who don't need it .Most modern cars the X1 can be customized be a multiple drive modes , including a sport mode with quicker throttle response and heavier steering and a comfort mode that pretty much does the opposite .

7,22,i3,"electric cars used to be viewed as anemic novelties for eco conscious do gooders . Okay , they still are by some people . But in recent years , electric cars have come a long way . Don't believe me . Go over there .This is the BMW I three , along with the much racier and more expensive I A8 represents BMW in a burgeoning field of electric cars already occupied by well known personalities like the Nissan Leaf Tesla model s numerous low volume contenders and depending on how you categorize them Chevy Volt and Toyota Prius , plug in . Among this field by three is one of the more interesting choices .Along with an all important BMW badge . It features a body made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic that sits atop an aluminum chassis that houses the drive .Train suspension components and lithium ion battery pack recharged times vary from three hours on a 220 volt home charging station to more than 20 hours on a standard 1 10 outlets Fully charged , BMW claims 80 to 100 miles of electric range of the reality of that depends on your driving habits .In a move to counter potential range anxiety , BMW offers a 38 $100.2 cylinder range extender with 2.4 gallons of gas on board .The tiny 650I CC engine doubles the eye three's total range , though it does add weight , thereby reducing pure electric range just a little bit .Okay , those are the essentials , but what's it like to drive from a dynamic perspective ? The eye three drives like a BMW . Steering is variable assist and has a quick ratio , which gives it a nimble sense that's nicely supported by higher than expected handling limits . Okay , there's a bit more body roll than I'd prefer in a car , but it doesn't seem to inhibit the eye three's ability to turn for a tall electric car . This thing is weirdly fun to drive .It's no model s but from a standstill . The BMW I three celebrates hard , getting 60 in about seven seconds . And unlike many electric cars after that , it keeps pulling , which is really nice when you're merging on the freeway faster than I should be going .What's really strange is what happens when you take your foot off the accelerator because of really aggressive power recovery from the electric motor .The car just decelerates in fact , if you playing far enough ahead , you can drive most of the time just using one pedal . Which is a shame because the brakes , unlike in a lot of electric cars , feel almost normal .Hall seats , big windows , a tight turning circle , a short 157.4 inch length , which is shorter than Honda fit .And an optional backup camera with guidelines and parking sensors make the eye three easy to maneuver and urban environments .Trade all that for the open road and has , you'd expect from a BMW suspension . Doesn't try to hide the tarmac of instead skillfully manages its inconsistencies .Maybe one of the biggest challenges in building an electric car is determining just how bold a stylistic and technological statement to make go crazy and you could alienate customers .Stay to traditional folks might question paying a premium for otherwise normal car saddled with range and recharge limitations .That traditional progressive balance is something that the BMW I threw does really well with this tall stance , frameless windows , contrasting panels and general weirdness . It's utterly distinct , and I mean weird in the most endearing way possible .I will say BMW might want to think about reinforcing the area around the charge port . When you push this panel reflexes more than the ultimate warrior move inside and it's more of the same . With all the swoopy shapes and contrasting textures , the interior feels pretty special . Actually , this stuff right here looks like a craft style speaker enclosure you might buy on , etc . But with the ego conscious context of the eye , three don't kind of make sense . I certainly hope this eucalyptus dash was responsibly forested . That was , Despite its bold futurism , A3 is surprisingly welcoming . If you've driven a BMW in the last five years , things should feel familiar .Steering wheel controls are straightforward . Bluetooth is easy to pair us be and auxiliary connectors , air conveniently placed in clearly labeled and the infotainment systems I drive controller is intuitive is always the only annoying that is the Dr Selector .Putting the vehicle in gear , so to speak , is pretty straightforward , but if you want a park it where you want to start it . If the reach awkwardly around the steering will push the buttons .Also , this screen said it's so far away from the driver .Might be nice if it was a little bit bigger , spending on your height entering the eye three is reasonably simple . Least a front climbing and back requires more effort . Once aboard , the seeds feature comfortable contouring . Headroom is plentiful , and with an adjustable center armrest and long throw telescoping steering wheel , it's easy to meld with the car . Things would be even nicer with adjustable front seat lumbar support and a center rear arm rest . And speaking of the back seats , leg room is just okay . But Henry was really quite good and with an elevated seating position , even if you're stuck in back , you still get to enjoy a nice , claustrophobia free view of the world outside Cluster for a rear worlds .Cross fitters don't need to worry , but for everyone else , a high lift over height can make loading heavy cargo a struggle . Master the lift and you'll be rewarded with a decently sized , pragmatically shaped trunk .Depending on federal and state tax incentives , you could chop nearly $10,000 off the BMW I three's $42,000 base price .For that some you'll get a car with 19 inch wheels , navigation led headlights and leather like upholstery . If you want stuff like a sun roof , kilos access and full leather upholstery .You need to move up from the base mega trim to the mid level gig a trim or the top level terror trip . Oh , and by the way , BMW refers to each of these trims as worlds , as in Megaworld . Yeah .Featured on the option sheet or a premium Harman Kardon audio system forward collision alert and a D C quick charge system that bumps the battery up to 80% charge in 20 minutes .Megaworld .It might not be for everybody , but if you're in the market for an electric car , you don't spend 70 grand on a Tesla model s . You like something that's more premium and more interesting than a Chevy Volt . And the notion of driving something that looks like this doesn't seem utterly insane . Then maybe the BMW I three is the electric car for you .Yeah , yeah ,"

9,24,8 Series,"This is the new BMW A8 Siris on Dhe . It's a large GT coach sits at the top of the range , which means it's Pasha than S7 , Siri's or the Six areas . The last time BMW didn't A8 Siri's , it was about 20 years ago . There is they're all kind of swoopy and sleek . Now . We'd like to see what I looked like 20 years ago . If I h is a well , look , there's May or fresh faced . Not so much .Now let's talk about the face of this A8 Siri's . You see , I do quite like it , but I'm not so sure about the Big Grill . It kind of reminds of the nose on the pigs of the angry birds down the sides , though it's got a great profile , this car really sleek and long . I like the fact this one's got the optional carbon roof . That just adds to the sporty flavour right in the back . This has got a sweet ass . Look at that back end . Now , I'm not so sure about this . Spoil it kind of looks a little bit stuck on . I wish it was integrated Maur into the body . Still , overall , it's a really smart looking car , but you do have to pay for it .Stops from �76,000 for this 8 40 d version . If you want to see how much money you can save on a new car , click on the pop out right in the top ranks of the screen on the link below the video to get a call while , alternatively , just Google Car . Why , it's easy .V8 Siri's is supposed to the pinnacle of the BMW rain . So does it feel suitably special enough compared to normal BMWs ? Toward that end , I think yes , it does . Just about it doesn't quite have the possessor of a Mercedes s Class coupe , but it's still pretty nice .I want to show you this . This center console design is reminiscent of the original A8 Syria's look very similar . Yes , I'm a bit of a car geek . Now , let's talk about the quality . So you've got leather on the dash , which feels very well maze . There's metallic effect here . You gotta get up here . I just wish that they had metal window switches like you get in Mercedes s class Coupe A8 . However , unlike Mercedes-Benz , consecrate pay which just have the odd , really cheap feeling , better trim about the place which lets the side down . This doesn't have any . Everything feels quality and good way to test The car's quality is with the sun visor , just how assaulted it feels and how well the mirror cover slides and that feels expensive . I was like the fact they got metallic effects here for the climate control running events . You've got the light design as well . Very nice on DDE . I thought you got frameless mirrors and horrible best all round in which I can feel a little bit . Chief Terry , this is really nice . Also like what they've done here , the way they have all the driving control . Just in one part . Now this particular car is fitted with the sections of pound optional crafted clarity is BMW cause it , and that includes glass elements for the drive controller . Then you stop Stop on by the on off control there on the stereo as well as a big crystal gear selector knob . Now , I'm not too keen on this in the lesser BMWs , but it's kind of okay here in the very cautious BMW , and it has an expensive ish feel to it .Let's talk about the practicality here in the coming , so I like the fact that look at this . You have got electric control for the steering will . Also , the seating position is spawning . Sit nice and low . It does have a low roof on this car , but you can get the seat loan of . If you're tall , you should just about be okay . There's a course plaintiff adjustment in the sea . You can push it all the way back if you get really , really long legs . The seats themselves are very comfortable , and you can adjust them for lumbar support as well on stretch out the base for more under leg support . Really nice day . It's comfy on long journeys .This particular car got here as an M sport upgrade on it , and it includes on in sports steering , which is pretty nice . It's got heated function on it here as well . It's handy to get to on looking for Emma Sports seat belts for an added a dash of color here in the cabin . The package also includes Alcatel off the reef lining , which does just add to the luxury field .Now let's talk about this entertainment system because A8 serious gets the latest version of BMW's I drive so you can operate it by touching it . You can use voice commands by going , Hey , BMW , what's the time ? It is 14 58 . You can also control it by gesture . So , yeah , if I do that , come on . There we go . I can wave my hand about and control certain things on dhe . I do use it for the volume . Onda , like Hey , can skip trucks by going on . That's it . Recognizing my jester , that's quite good fun . It's nice to use on some way . He seems a bit more intuitive than actually pressing a button on the steering wheel to do it . There are more functions than in previous BMWs , but it's not too confusing the hell out the many , just as you want it as it's customizable . If you want , you can use the old fashioned swivel well , which is actually pretty good when you're driving along . It's nice and easy to operate , and you could just wait three different menus and just activate different things . So it's good . They've retained that unlike Audi , which has got rid of this with the world control and just come fully touch screen , which isn't such a good idea . You can use the entertainment system to control all the cards major functions and can do things like or to the color of the interior ambient lighting , which is standard on this car . There's not too many colors to choose from , but there's enough . You gotta think about Blue Green , but I think it just looks better with orange to match the exterior paint . It's pretty cool . Also have various online app , so you can do things like check the weather or the news . And there's even a concierge service where you can contact someone at BMW for help with the car or taxi program . You're certain of remotely instead , simple . My only major real problem with this entertainment system is the fact that when you have Apple carplay , there is no android auto , so I can't connect my phone to it , and I'd like to . Still , the screen is very sharp . The graphics look good on the map is really responsive when you try and move it around . Now let's move on to the digital drivers display , which I don't think it's quite a successful as those in an Audi or a Mercedes so part . The reason is that it's all quite dark . It doesn't quite the functionality , either . You get in the other German cars as well , so you can choose different views . And things are . But it's not quite extensive . Also , not a big fan of the rev counter game backwards . Now they've done that so that the freedom space in the middle for the satnav , unfortunately , is no that clear . One thing I will point out , though , is I like the fact they have the little graphic of the car , and it showed in the color that you have the car , which is a nice touch . The specifications on this car is really , really good as standard in the UK we get there sport version , which has a ll the kit you really need . Finally , let's talk about the cubby spaces because they do matter if you're gonna be in a grand tour . A crossing continents . So the door bins along , but not really very wide . So I could just about squeeze that intuit . The glove box is so safe the manual does take of a bit of space beacon away . Really , because you have the manual installed on the court entertainment system . So just use that one instead . Under here , you do have quite a bit of space , and you've got your USB C . Now , what is that ? Your species socket there to plug in . The mobile device is also under here . You have a normal USB socket so you can plug in your phone system there as well . And there's a little pad there for Wallace charging for your mobile phone or to charge the cause . Kay , you got a couple of cup holders here . Why ? Any problem in the Cup holders is that this part of the cover just hangs over the top of its gonna be careful not to catch your coffee cup when you're lifting , acting much , spill it everywhere . And I mean really , really annoying .Almost as annoying as having to be a passenger in the back of this car . Let me show you why . So I'm going to move this seat out of the way so you can see what the heck is going on . Now . I'm gonna jump into the back so already it's not . You just have to wait to the sea . Moves out of the way . It's very low . Roof on 70 . Really squat down and watch this , right ? I'm gonna pull this back . This is not gonna be pleasant . It's not pleasant . Start to crush my legs . I'm not gonna build to trouble anywhere . I know headroom . No need is not as comfy in the back as something like an escape A or a Bentley Continental GT . It's no really that much better than a Porsche 9 11 Either You do have some coat hooks there and you have some eyes fix hunger points down here , and they do have sturdy flip it covers so you won't lose them on the anchors themselves . Easy to get to . So once you got the PBC in it , it's not too hard to locate it onto the ice affects . There is one thing that's really annoying about this car , though . I want to show you there . So Mercedes s class keep A8 doesn't have this pillar here . It's all glassy . Get a nice of you out . And if you put the windows down , it's really cool that another thing the Mercedes has is a little seat belt , but that hands on your seat belt when you get in the car . It's a little device that does that for you . This car doesn't have it , though .It's a bit of a shame , really . There is one way that it makes up for it , and that's with a big , big boots is bigger than the Mercedes boot is actually quite a decent size , and you can carry a lot in it so long as you can squeeze whatever you want to carry through this gap eyeball microwave at Christmas , and I'm just managed to squeeze it through there to get in the back and get home . Lip isn't too big to list off over , but the boot itself is wrong with the large , actually , so you can pack it quite full . You got some netted area here where you can store some stuff , have some tender points here and here we can tie stuff down , and if you want it by putting these levers , I can fall down the rear seats . Any problem is , is that I have to walk all the way around hello them because they're so far away . You contacting reach through to do it in the boot . Once you've done that , you've got a flattish floor , and I've actually carried my snowball get in this car . Which is quite impressive considering it's a sleek looking Cooper .Now then it's time for the car y A5 annoying things about this car .There's quite a bit of fake advantage on this BMW A8 syriza's straight now with a car while stick of truth . So look at this here .Either there's more front . But what about the exhaust ? Well , for that , I'm gonna use the new car . Wow , stuff of truth . There's a little bit like Gandalf of Lord of the Rings , but look , yes , there is an actual exhaust pipe there , which is good . It's just a show . They've ruined it by having this unnecessarily large fake surround .Why is that ? Have may have , like traffic updates , but it's not always the smartest when it comes to picking the best route . For instance , if you have the satnav running on your going away that you're used to going and you decide to take it out of detox , you know it'll save you time . This sudden just won't pick it up , and you'll keep on trying to re route you back on a route , which is longer Eventually it'll flip over . Go Oh , actually , the route you've chosen will get you there quicker . It's annoying .The car comes with a digital key , which may seem impressive because you could do things . Operate the ventilation system . When you're outside the car , however , the screen is so like it's like the mobile phone from the early noughties and really don't carry that around in your pocket .However , they didn't do let you connect a virtual Petey or phones , you could actually open the CAF using your phone . Fortunately , it only works for android phones , which is ironic because this system inside the Carly I drive doesn't work with Android auto on the Apple Carplay like you need one kind of phone for one thing , one kind of phone for another , the little seat belt buckle Assist a bit proud of this central part of the seat .That means that when you fold , the seat backs down and you put some weight on them . You actually get them pushing into the soft marina leather , and if you look here , you can see I've done it once and I've got two indentations there on the seats , and that's really doing my head in makes a weird noise when you accelerate .It kind of sounds a bit like a B a petrol , but it's not . You get an artificial noises , play to the car speakers , and I like that because on the outside , it just sounds like a diesel to everyone else . I don't I don't want the fame career . It's a bit like the blooming fake exhaust pipes , isn't it ?Thankfully , these cars planted cool features to help make up for all this S5 A8 serious gets a really good heads up displays .It's nice and big and clear , and it shows stuff such as the speed limit directions from the satellite navigation . And if you have in sports mode , a rev counter the engine head anyway . So it'll show things such as warning signs .For instance , if someone opens the door thing , this guy's brilliant high definition surround view cameras . And if I go into three D mode , I can actually look at the cars if it's in a computer game and look around it using gesture controls or by using the control well here on all noticed there , Look , there seems to be somebody stood behind the car now if wanna reverse past them , I could isn't really clever . So this constant admitted in court . Reversing assistant . If I hit that , engage it in the car , automatically learns my steering inputs for the past 50 meters , and then he can play them backwards so I can get the car automatically . Reverse past that person . They're automatically steer safely around them . And look , there's another person there yet it'll stay the other way to get around them as well . This'll really handy if you're parking in an underground car park , and it's really twisting Tony and needed to reverse out dead simple and in this case , dead safe .How cool is that ? Thanks . A real well staring the back wheels turned in the opposite direction to the front wheels when you're driving slowly and that helps aid low speed maneuverability , which is handed a long car such as this , they were going faster . The backwards , too , in the same direction as the front A8 high speed stability .The optional laser headlights are twice as bright as normal headlights on . They can shine to 600 meters down the road .A3 active cruise control is really clever . So uses the sack now see , there's a bend in the road and it'll actually decide . The car needs to slow down . Look my feet on touching the pedals . Yet I've got the cruise control set up 45 miles an hour , and it's slowly down to 35 to take this corner , even though I'm pretty sure that car going around there quicker . That's really clever . Also , the whole piloted drive system , which pretty much drives the car itself on the motorway kitchen lake , just safe distance in the car in front , is among the very best I have ever expected .First thing I noticed was driving this car is that it feels massive on the outside is quite compact here on the inside , but you're never sure where the corners of the car are . Your huge bonnet to look over the sat quite low and you're going through gaps in traffic just wins , and you just hope you're not gonna hear anything . You do have the cameras you can press to look around , but they turn off after 10 miles an hour . The visibility is what you expect from a coupe A8 , and it can be quite intimidating in tight spaces , one saving grace is you got a big back window , so you do get a decent V8 in the back .The rest of the experience in town is actually quite good . Now , this car has adaptive dampers have standard , and you have a comfort . Moti could make them nice and soft . But you do feel the bump s'more than in a Mercedes s class coupe acres that has air suspension , which kind of just glides of the road . So it's comfy enough , but just not the most luxurious in terms of how it travels over bumps . The rest of the experience is to find the gearbox is brilliant in this guy's S8 speed auto , you put your foot down book , it's on it . And then when you just want to relax , it just blends the gears together . Really , really well .So for a long , long distances , this car is great now , but the diesel three litre straight six diesel engine 320I horse part north , 16 under five seconds . It's really , really quick . You can get a 4.4 litre twin turbo V8 . That's five that your horse bites really blooming quick .Naught to 60 in about 3.7 seconds super rapid , but a bit more thirsty now , while there's a series might not be quite as comfortable as that Mercedes s class que pay get onto the road and you feel the benefit .It's really shocked to drive , actually , for something . The ways almost 1900 kilos R8 grips in the corners is really impressive , and you can feel it's like dart into a turn when it turned the wheel . That really will still somehow just makes it just filled , planted and lively . And it's really good staring sharp as well . And it does that thing where the more you turn it , the more responsive it becomes . If you just move it a bit , it's not overly responsive . So that balance that just right now could complain that you don't have to feel through the wheel like you're doing some more sporty cars . And it's not a sport here . It's fun , isn't like a portion of 11 . But for a big GT-R is a good handling car on . I think it's pretty good fun as well apart . The reason for that is that yes , it is four wheel drives , he got that added , secured the extra grip . But because It's rare Dr Bias , like it expected BMW to bay . It does give you that sensation being pushed along the road , and it just makes it fell a little bit more sporty . They really wondering . Well , now will it slide of it ? After what BMW that should be able to . Well , let's find out now All they do is put the car into its sport . It's mode which stiffens up the suspension , sharpens the throttle response , adds weight to the steering press and hold the traction control button on it will disengage the traction control . And then it should do what BMW do despite being four wheel drive .Well , Dr Means you call get slowed down in quite the same way .You can't do a little bit , which is silly enough .BMW give us a limited slip differential on the rear are standard in the UK Thanks definitely more fun than a Mercedes S Class coupe A8 .

10,25,M5,"I'm in the new BMW M5 and I want to know what you do .Is it as fast accelerating as the Mercedes AMG E 63 S4 title of those recently ? And it did not to 60 in 3.2 seconds in the standing quarter mile in 11.2 seconds . Is this new M5 faster ? What I'm gonna find out by launching it so we'll have to do is turn the dear see off . There we go . Put the gearbox into its sport is setting , or the right or the wrong launch . I got this time and gear here , which will give me the results . So let's find out this is fast .Oh , that's a stunning court , right ? Right .That definitely Phil fast . Was it faster than the Mercedes , so North S60 didn't do it . Can he beat 3.2 seconds ? Well , it's done in 3.1 seconds . It's faster to 60 than the Mercedes . Let's see the standing quarter time . That's the big one , though . Can it be 11.2 seconds ? Will It is done the standing quarter in 11.1 seconds . It's faster than the Mercedes BMW found Boys . Rejoice this new M5 has The exact same amount of power is the old M5 30 Yara , which I clocked at 12.6 seconds for the standing quarter mile . So what's the reason for the new ones ? Better time like Mercedes BMW has given the M5 or will drive , and it's a newly developed system on dhe . It can send in theory , 100% of engines . Talk to the front wheels if it needs to , but generally it likes to be really will drive . You can actually change the setting if you want to put it into a wheel drive sport mode , so less power goes to the front . So it's got more of a rear drive by us , seeing a bit more slip in the corners . Now , if you're really brave what you can do , as with the Mercedes , you can stop it being or will drive and make it . Two will drive only to engage it .It's dead simple . All you have to do is turn the stability control off , then configure an ex dr , Then just move the cursor to two wheel drive and it's got more .That means you get the best of both worlds . Eyes , cars , not only great skids , but also for launches . So I won't know just how much difference having four wheel drive has made to this car . So I've put this one into two . Will drive mode . The guy next to me is in four wheel drive mode . Are we gonna have a race and see what happens ?Oh , no , no , no , no , no . Ah Long sideways on . Well , that's the standing quarter . I know . I certainly I can still see . This might Behind May .Right ? So standing quarter was 14.4 seconds . No . 26 day . It's not gonna be good . 6.8 seconds . And I think I did all that with the tires just spinning upside . It's a good job They made this car or will drive .The new M5 starts from �90,000 . That's almost double that of a 5 40 I X drive .However , you do get so much more . Performance Power comes from a 4.4 litre twin turbo V8 with 600 horsepower and 750 Newton meters of talk , which is impressive , though not quite as impressive as Mercedes-Benz V8 , which has 610 horsepower and 850 Newton meters . Still , this BMW is available with this rather lovely optional carbon fiber engine cover . I think I might just have that and see him something . Get it on eBay . Wonderful notices gone . The standard fit rear end differential could move power about between the back wheels descended the wheel with the most grip for improved corner exiting traction . Now , while the old M5 years a deal clutch automatic gearbox , this one has an eight speed with a tall converter , which may make it seem about as modern as this mountain bike . But the reason they've gone for a talk converter is that it's smoother , and it's strong enough to cope with this car's extra talk . The engine has a special high pressure oil system , which works in high G conditions . So when you're calling really faster that you don't get oil starvation and damaged the engine , you better put your cap back . Otherwise , I may actually damage the engine . When you start the M5 , it automatically has a sports exhaust in its and loudest setting , which is exactly what you wanted and after fat around , turning it on to make it sound as good as it can and will you rev it ? It sounds like this .It's pretty awesome . But if you start the car early in the morning , you don't want that to annoy your neighbors , so you can press a button in the cabin to make it go quiet and you'll hear the valve close . That was it just then . Now when you read it , it's a little less rocker , So happy neighbours Happy driver . But the new M5 isn't just about sounding good .It's about looking good , too . There are some key styling upgrades over the normal five series to make the M5 stand out , so you've got some extra creases in the bonnet to make it look more aggressive and hint of the power that lurks beneath . You've also got deeper from bumper with large air intakes and a standard M5 gets active led headlamps .It also gets 20 inch alloys or standard on within . There you can opt to have common ceramic brakes , which is what this car has .They might notice that the wheel arches a bit more pronounced , and that's because this car has a wider track over the normal five series and wider world for improved road holding . Also for improve road holding is lowered . Stiffened suspension . They pretty much just this . Look a little Ann Budge here and what looks like an air breather , but I've had a look in here , and I can't see any holes to breathe air through . So I think that's fake .Why do that ? BMW classic M style door mirrors there .Look up here . There's a carbon reef , and that helps keep the center of gravity as low as possible once again for improved road holding at the back . Look , we got the wooden wheel arches makes it look squat and purposeful . Another ren is a tiddly little boot spoiler . I don't know how much down force that is going to provide the anyway . Then we've got the M5 bunch there court tailpipes on dhe , a rear diffuser . So what you think about this car's design ? Click it there to vote . If you think this M5 looks better than a Mercedes , A 63 M5 gets the same well built interior with excellent entertainment system as a standard A5 Siri's , but for some rather important upgrades out standard . You get these M6 port seats .They looked really cool . They do a great job of hugging your body .Being an M car , You get some sport here m dollars and you can change the look of them from or driver . Focus display . You get some end budges about the place blue and red stitching on various items , including the safety belt on look even from the floor mats . Lovely . There's also carbon five months into console on the dash .It all helps lift the cabin . These are M3 set buttons , absolutely brilliant , say consent at the car settings exactly as you like it . Then depress one of these on it takes you straight to the settings you want . So , for instance , if I press this one , I've got semi limited traction control on dhe , sporty for World Dr Press .This one twice and I mean to will drive mode with stability control completely off for instant skids , M5 gets his own unique gear selector , though I think looks a little bit tacky .You can use these buttons on the top to alter the ferocity of the gear changes , and down here you can also mother settings as well , such as the responsiveness of the engine , the stiffness , the adaptive suspension on dhe , the way to the steering , have it just as you like it on . This type of customization is very important if you want to performance car , which can double as a daily driver now .One of the great things about the M5 has always been the fact that it's a dual purpose car , so it's a big , family friendly saloon on with all the settings in the most relaxed state . You wouldn't know that it's a CE fast as a supercar .But then , if I double press this button , I've got into sports mode now . What sports plus on the engine So more response . I've got sport here set upon the suspension .More weight to the steering on Exhaust is louder .Plus four wheel drive system is now in Maur rear drive bias mode . So you get that sensation of really being pushed from the back , and it does . It does fail like a proper car . Yeah , you got the safety net of four wheel drive grip if you need it , And in England , where it's often very rainy , you'll appreciate that attraction . You also appreciate how the M5 gadgets could take the strain out of driving on the motorway .You can put the cruise control on . They'll keep you safe . Distance from the car in front , and it'll even steer . Look , keep in lane . Just chill out . We'll take the sting on effort at long journeys .But then when you want to take control again and have some fun Yeah , you definitely can't , thanks to that high performance engine . So let's just say that some poor person behind you thinks they're going to overtake it . There they are . Look . So the good thing about having such a high performance engine is that you are effectively king of the road if you don't let people passed . Ah , you don't have to come past going . Don't know . Go have another go . No , that's not gonna happen . One more trying . One more try . Go on . Go on . You can do it . Oh , no . Look , it's happened again .Yeah . What ? What ? BMW drivers have bad reputations .You need help with that right now ? Sorry , BMW . It's only drivers . Now they're the worst .However , when it comes to driver behavior on track , the emptively is quite keen to maintain bad boy reputation . Of course , no owners will hardly any anyway . Well , actually , do this kind of thing in their car , but it's important for a bit around the track . The four wheel drive mode with red drive bys is a great set into being really Q7 slighted . A bit grips on . It helps whole . You have a corner . It's a big old car this , but it does handle well . Now , if I want , I can put the car into two wheel drive mode . So one of the great things about this car Big Ray will drive is that if you want , you can , of course , get it super sideways , and it's it's every bit as much fun as a BMW M5 should be .I mean , any question really is how much life is left in your tires . Audi M5 like this for too long . You'll see .Okay , you see these ? These are actually bits . The car's tire sort of de laminated it . They got a bit overheated and this big bits missing from the center that's ruined . Maybe I should spend more time driving the car in a wheel rather than to will drive mode .Well , still , that's the beauty You in five minutes Switchable X drive system . It's all the hooligan you'd ever want in a car , yet far quicker and more capable than anything that's gone before . What an incredible machine .

11,26,X1,"This is the BMW X1 .Now the old X1 didn't really look much like an SUV did it knows is just too long , and it kind of reminded me of a two could . And it's huge bill , this one , though the proportions are just right . It does look like an SUV , so it's kind of chunky , too tall . It's actually based on the mini platform , more than a BMW platform on that has allowed him to be to maximize the space inside for the overall outside dimensions .So if you come to the back , you'll see I have got loads in the room . Absolutely acres of headroom . Fact .This guy's more spaces in the back than its key viable , such as the Mercedes Gel A on the Audi Q3 plus Middle C .It's not the wild this , but it is comforting if if you need to carry three and then maybe a humping the floor . But it's not too large on the football's , a huge there's enough room for everyone's feet . Also , you can get this car with receipts that slide for more boots base . They also recline as well , so you can get even more comfortable . And if I pull this down . You'll see you've got an arm rest there . Some cup holders . They're little appointments , storage area there . But this is useful . The fact that these seats split three ways so you can carry two people in the back on some skates through there or longer items . If you need to say on the hole in the back seats , this car is very , very impressive .We've gone to the boot , so out of the back seat . This is the biggest of boot in its class . It's absolutely massively . Look at that . Loads of room there . Nice square shape as well on there's no lower lip to lift stuff over . You got some company storage about the place you got . 12 volt socket . You got tethering points . Well , what's not to like on Dhe ? Look how much under floor storage is under there . I could get under there . And this is a feature I do really like . It's Well , look , I can for them the receipts just by putting the book , and I don't have to reach in . There we go . And there you have it . A nice flat lobe . A . This is one very practical car . Now , if you click it , they can get more information by watching our detail practicality , video . You can see just how much stuff we could fit in this car's boot , how easy it is to fit a child seat in the back on just what it's like with three adults in the rear .Now that brings us on to the front of the car . Because not only is this more practical than the old X1 , it's also more luxurious . Inside . BMW really upped their game with this car . The interior Corti is way ahead of that . The old car on its its rivals as well . I mean , you look about the places , even soft touch plastics down here . It's all very lovely , nicely laid out as well on .Then there's the entertainment system now at Stan , did you get 6.5 inch screen and sat right across the range ? Now this particular car actually has the upgraded pro system with an 8.8 inch screen on It's absolutely lovely and control it all using BMW Zay drive , which I've said so many times in all my reviews .I think it's the easiest system to use on the market . In fact , if you click up there , he watch our full review of the infotainment system of this kind .Have another good look around this cost cabin , and you will notice that could be could be under there decent cup holders . They're large door bins as well . And yet the glove box is a reasonable size so bitterly X1 . It looks smart inside on its very practical said then that's a sensible stuff dealt with .Now it's time to see what these cars like to drive kind of people are gonna buy this car there could be more than happy with how this thing handles fails to drive . So if you compare it to its other small SUV rivals , it doesn't feel the most sporty . It's just the controls . They just more lives . You can feel what the cause doing either through your fingertips A3 your bottom on it , does it grips goes on corners really well . On the advantage of that is , when you're driving in town , you really know what you didn't wanna nick through traffic on maneuver on . It is quite easy car to drive around because visibility , especially Ford , is very good .This windscreen is huge . There aren't too many blind spots . The only made one , I think , is the rear pillars , because the actual back window is quite large . And if you get there , you can see yourself by watching my 360 degree video review passenger ride .The other thing I should mention this car is that it's comfy as well , but this one is fitted with the optional adaptive dampers .You should definitely get them . They're not that expensive .And they have a comfort mode , which slackens off the ride and make it really nice and comfy on the motorway . It's it's a good crews of this car . The only problem is , is that you do get quite a bit Tyrell .In terms of engines , you get one petrol or three days . ALS . The best choice for most people is gonna be the X1 One a day will do around 68 miles per gallon . This is a range topping ex drive , which means got four wheel drive 25 day on dhe . Yeah , it's really fast , nor 66.6 seconds got 230 horsepower . Completely unnecessary in a car like this on economy falls as result of 56 mpg though the trip Computer says it's fallen even further for May at 39 miles per gallon . The good thing about this particular engine , though , is that you get the automatic gearbox is standard on .I would recommend it's about �1600 extra A8 speed auto Lovely , slake responsive know everything about the BMW X1 is good .Here's five annoying things about it .I don't know . One automatic car has to have such a huge gear selector . It's gonna be getting on for about seven inches .This car feels pretty luxurious .You just remind me again , Jack , how much is this bitter gonna call with all the options for it to it , for it to grand 42 grand ? Oh my God , you could have an X5 for that . You better be careful with the options list .It's a bit annoying that BMW decide to give this car a one to Peace parcel shelf . Just two bits to clutter up your boot .There's too little diesel engine isas roofies . And never listen to this .Unlike with many rivals or the emergency braking isn't standard . So you gotta be very careful that you don't accidentally hit something .Oh , dear .However , It's not all bad .Their plaintive call features on the X1 , which more than make up for all this double pull bonnet release means that by doing that , you don't have to do a separate catching . You need the bonnet and therefore you don't get your hands dirty . We've been to the concierge service . There's someone at your beck and call 24 7 and they'll even program the SAT nav for you remotely if you can't be bothered to do it .Lots of covered in this cushioning felt that they don't rattle or knock when they touch the center console .Well , that's one of the attention to detail . The optional panoramic sunroof is absolutely sleep plumbing massive on DDE . You can open it as well .There's ice A6 fittings on the front passenger seat , which makes it easy to store base .So then I roll . What's my verdict on the BMW X1 ? Should you avoid it ? She didn't consider it . Should you short list it , or should I just go right ahead and buy it while I record ? Yeah , you should go right ahead and bites because if you're in the market for a small premium SUV and you can afford it . This is the best one was watching . Enjoy this video , please .

12,27,A4,"the BMW A4 serious now , some cause a bit like people . Can you guess which person this car will be ? A . So in your days , I give up . Okay , So if this was a person , it would be Kim Cardassian . They're pretty wondering why . Well , the reason is that beam to be says this car is widest , but its hips just like Mrs Kanye West . And there we go . Look , Mrs West , I'm sorry . Wrong . Mrs West . A4 serious on Dhe , Just like Kim .This four . Siri's has a really big boot . It's much bigger than the Mercedes C class Who pays ? It's really , really useful . You got big , wide opening . You can think quite a lot of stuff in it . You do get fold down rear seats , but if you want to split three ways so that you can carry two people in the back on DSK each to the middle , you need to pay extra for that , which you don't have to on the Mercedes . Now , if you click up there the top right corner of the screen on the card , you can see just how much stuff we could fit in this car's boot .You can also see just what it's like to fit a baby seat in the back of this car on how much room is in the back seats . But I'll summarize now , So if I climb into the back seats , you will see just how much room have back here . Now , pop that seat back . I'm gonna move this out of your way . But look at this . You have to slide it forward electrically . Doesn't do automatically like it doesn't . It was heavy . C class group A8 . And now you should be out , See what the heck is going on . All right , put the seat back on . Yeah , this was about the three way split folding rear seats . Now I'm gonna pull the seat back . That's easy . My driver's position got lots of knee room on headroom . It's not great , right ? But it's not on any of these cars . But out of these , these ku pays this forces is the best . I could actually travel a little bit of distance in the back of this car .The only problem is look , there's no real stories . You get some nets here , but you can't really for anything in there . And you get this This tray , which is Yeah , but you can leave your mobile there on that about it Now . Story jacket in the front of the car is way better , so I just put this back slowly to use the room . There we go . Get back into the front of the car .Thank God .Now , here in the front , this car makes really annoying nays . This car is very , very much like the three serious , so it's got driver orientated cockpit and quality . It's really strong . Bart's the design . It's just a little bit boring compared to the Mercedes E class . Keep on the Lexus arse . It's getting on a bit now on . The equipment's quite as good as you get with them , either .It is better than three serious so standard you'll get things like this in on headlamps . You'll also get your own parking sensors .You get satellite navigation , which brings us on to BMW infotainment system .So this actually has the upgraded satellite navigation with widescreen , and it's lovely . But still whichever model you go for the user interface , the I drive with this swivel will the touchpad on just the way the menus laid out . It's just so easy to use it is the best on the market . And if you click up there on the car in the top right corner the screen , you can see an in depth video review of the entertainment system and have another good look around this car's cabin on ready to finish off . I'll just talk about couples because , well , yeah , they're okay . Big door bins Here on Dhe . You have a decent size glove box as well , so there's enough places here in the front for the bits and pieces .However , the big question is , what is the bank of the Force ? It was like when you hit the road , it's a BMW set this force Erie's up to beam or sporty A3 Siris on which it's based on . That is a really good platform , anyway to begin with . And it is a genuinely good , fun car to drive . Feels like a sports car . It looks like one . Yeah , it's almost is practical . A salute . It's almost no compromise on without essential adaptive suspension . As you move from sports mode after you've been having some fun and go into comfort mode to cruise around it , it's really , really comfortable .One thing that doesn't this car down the road . The road noise when you get a speeding get their wind whistle as well . That's a shame , because otherwise it would almost be the complete package .And I go for the 40 way Die because he's got to lay a turbo petrol , which is really quick . Andi has decent economy , really , but those people by one of the diesels and this is the 4 20 day , and it's actually the four wheel drive . Rather in the real world . Dr Versions , as the ex Dr Model Unbearably says , it'll well with this automatic gearbox should do around 60 miles per gallon , Though I'm no averaging now , I'm getting the low forties .Also , I think the visibility for this car , you know , for a coupe A4 keeping it'll be back window . In fact , you can see for yourself by clicking up there on the card to watch my in depth , 360 degree video of this car .So far , then the BMW four Serious is a pretty decent all rounder for a coupe A . But it does have some annoying traits .It may look like a sports car , but this rally too late diesel make it sound more like a van .Another BMW , another pointless phone cradle under the Central Army .If you don't have the adjustable M6 port suspension , the car doesn't ride or handle as well as it should in his spend extra on the automatic gearbox .Because Manu models aren't that great in the pedals offset to the right , however , we can forgive the force in his system of these because it does have some cool features . A4 serious has the lowest centre of gravity of any car BMW normal range of cars . It's actually below half a meter in case you get the central hat has enough room for four people skis .The doors were specifically engineered to make a high quality clothes , and when they shut , these little breathers let truck their escape from the wheel wells to help reduce drag the seatbelt but automatically hands you the belt .Get in the car so creepily like theater marries really Scott's alien .So then , overall , what I think of the BMW A4 Siri's well , it can be a little bit noisy .It's speed on dhe .You have to spend extra on the adaptive suspension for it to drive as well as it can , but if you do , it's both comfy on firm . Plus , it's very practical for this type of coop .If you look up there , you can see some more reviews and find out the best deal you can get on the car car .Wow dot co dot uk .Watch it over there to watch our detail . Practicality , entertainment on three 160 degree passenger ride today for the BMW four .Serious Now that is what the strike in the video it was . The date on the calendar in the 20th of April , which is in America , is for 20 ."
13,28,3 Series,"the B end of Lee three . Siri's . Now this is the benchmark by which all other compact executive cars are judged . Yeah , Matthew Watson , London I'm a car reviewer . It's a master am X5 and its supercharged . How much ? Don't forget that . Sorry , I was just on hold to my insurance company trying to get quote on my car anyway . The three series . Yes , so it's comforts desirable . It's fun , and it's surprisingly practical as well .In the back seat , you'll be surprised how much room there actually is . M5 for 11 ish on Legendary room . Plenty of head room people over six foot will be fine back here . Now you can't go A3 arrest really very much comfort , because if I move across the middle seat , you see my head is rambling pockets of reason . It's hitting actual plastics around for the high level brake light . If you actually want to see just what it's like with three people in the back , click in the top right hand corner of the screen on the card , right in debt practicality review , and you got to see how easy it is to fit a child .See here in the back and so much stuff we could fit in the boot . Now , in terms of actual volume , it's on a par with its main rivals , but the three serious his boot because of the shape of it . It's more practical than the Mercedes C Class is , but not quite as good as the Audi A4 is . But you're still gonna be able to fit lots of stuff in here . Andi , get folding down receipts a standard , though if you want to split like this , cause you do have to pay extra for that .In terms of the design , the three series is very distinctive . You've probably never really seen one from this angle from the site because you're either see the front of them as they appear bottom on the motorway or the rear as they was passed it . The inside feels just a sport A8 . I like the way the dash is angled towards you and how you sit nice and low . The driving position is just spot on and build quality . That's really good . This feels like an expensive car on the inside . You've also got sufficient could be space is not the best in the business , but it's pretty good on equipment is impressive as well .All cars across the range get satellite navigation . I say Go for the E D model , though , because then you get leather seats , which are heated in this car . I've got the professional satnav , so once again , that's upgraded to get a wider screen and get live traffic updates . But whichever model you go for , you have BMW .I drive system . You control everything through the swivel . Well , it's dead easy to use . It is the best on the market , and you can see our full review of it and get into the look around the interior by clicking on the top right hand corner of the screen on the card A3 Serious is available with a raft of cool features .Is five of them .There's a concierge service , Beck and call out the penthouse at the Ritz three years Servicing plan is really good value on the three year warranty has unlimited mileage , and usually the automatic gearbox is often more economical than the manuals .The stunning if it S O . S system will call the emergency service is if you have an accident .A3 Serious was the first car in its class tore its own high speed mobile Internet .While all this is good , some things about the three seriously , unless impressive Emmanuel models , the offset pedals make it feel like your feet almost outside the car .The entry level petrol engine now has just three cylinders , which is lumber .Sport isn't even on the top trim level . The automatic gear selector is a necessarily large and a touch phallic .It's very easy to get carried away with the options . This car has 30 grand's worth , which is almost enough for however , there is one option , which you should definitely spend extra . Now when your pricing of your BMW A3 Siri's make sure your factor in an extra �515 for the option reductive end sport suspension .You might be thinking , I don't need that , actually . But believe me , you do , because without the car just doesn't drive as well as it should . So you got sports mode , so it's all hunkered down and taught . But for most of the time , you gonna drive in comfort mode with the suspension or slackened off a nice and supple and believe me , it's gonna be the best money I ever spent . because then you got the best of both worlds . A car that's both bone . If only the steering was quite as nice as it is in a Jackie Rexy , R8 will be the full package . Another option you might want to consider is the automatic gearbox . Because it's brilliant . Bend of these autos are among the best , if not the best in the business . I can't say the same for the manuals they didn't know come with rev matching for smooth down ships . Another good thing is that if you wanted a war drive car because you're living , let's say snow is Scotland or Wales . You don't have to have an Audi A4 quarter anymore because you can get a four wheel drive version of the three Siri's , though , to tell you the truth , I would really bother . I just save some money and get some winter tires .In terms of engines , you can get petrol powered hybrid power or days or power , which is obviously the main state of the range here in the UK On this , particular cars got the two litre diesel . It's the 3 20 x drive on . Well , you know , naught to 60 . This thing's pretty much well . But he expects , Ah , hot hearts to bay . It's very , very quick , yet returns good economy is all We'll drive Version , for instance , could do 56 mpg . According to BMW , though my trip computer says 48 miles per gallon , which to be fair for real well driving isn't too bad . Diesel engine is a little bit noisy compared to the quiet unit you can get in the Audi A4 . On the whole , the three serious just seems to have more road noise , wind noise and get in the Mercedes C Class .I can't fault its visibility , though , the pillars of quite thin . So you get a very good view out , which is really handy with trying to navigate around town . You can actually see for yourself by clicking in the top right hand corner of the screen on the card by 360 degree video .So overall , what don't think of the BMW A3 Siri's well , it does suffer from a bit of Tyrell at speed on .You do have to spend extra on the adaptive suspension fit to drive as well as it can .If you do that , it handles brilliantly and it's great fun .Plus , it's surprisingly practical now for more information to see what you can get in a car flick up there to go to car way dot co dot uk Thanks for watching Click over There for our group test video between the BMW three serious Mercedes-Benz Audi A4 and Jack Your exit .

14,29,X4,"This is the new BMW X for , and it's a little bit like sushi because you pay Maur , but you actually get less . Now let me explain . You said S4 , is basically an X3 .The X3 starts and �39,000 .This starts from �43,000 because of that coop a like profile , you've got less room inside . But it is cooler , a bit like choosing sushi over the traditional fish and chips .Now , if you'll see how much money you can save one of these cars on the black belt in the top right corner of the screen to get a car away because it call , you could save an average of �3600 on new car .Let's stop this review by talking about this car's key feature , and it is this swoopy back end . Now there's a trade off for it . It means the overall big capacity is 5% less than the X3 Sze . But it's not that big a deal , is it ? You think , But it's not the size that matters . It's what you do with it that counts . And here's the problem . You say , Well , this is nice and square . Generally , that lower tapered line for the boot means that you can't stack things too high further back . So , for instance , for us to try and shoot the boot now , it's not going to have any of it . Look , they didn't like that at all . Put that back up . Also , there's a bit of a boot lid there to lift stuff over , which can be a problem if you got heavy items such as this , at least is a metal plate there , so you don't scuff your paintwork . And that's where my complaints end , because this is actually a very useful , but there's lots of nice features . There's no bag . What's there to stop the shopping from rolling around the beat when you cornering Sturdy tie down tethers there . Look at that and you can remove them if you want . Then there's some strapping for your bottles on Looking from storage . No shit . Some removable storage jets , which can use to hold your manky date sushi , look the cover for the other floor Storage is not a gas Strat . Identical problems keeping it up . It's all right . Listen , I promise No more innuendoes in this video that says it's gonna turn into carry on car reviews . So if you look , there's some decent space , there's not a spare wheel . There's not even any tire repair kit because this conference on run flat tires now more on that later because it does actually matter . I think I do like about this there look like some other cars . You could fall down the back seats in here , levers in the boot so you don't have to go running around on the load area . It is pretty flat , as you can see there , which does make it easier to push these heavy items to the front . And all cars were stunned to get electrical tailgate .Now this sloping roof line , it does mean that this car doesn't have quite such a wide open in the back seats as the X3 police out of here , actually , so that can make it a little bit trickier when you're gonna maneuver all those really big rearward facing child seats . So I'll just get in . What doesn't make it so hard to fit chart is this . Look , Little ice picks flaps makes is dead easy . It's actually locate the seat into place and doesn't need room . Look , you can see I've got plenty A6 . My usual driving position . Foot room . There's plenty of that as well . You can actually stretch out by putting your feet into the sea in front head room . Well , I'm okay , look , but it is pretty tight . People over 64 may find it a touch cramped back here . It's made worse if you have three in the back at once . So the issue is that you then push the attitude people to the outside and this roof line slopes quite like the side . So toilet people willing to put in the head prince there was in the middle . It's just about livable . Yes , there's a humping the floor . But like I've already said , the foot was a big too slender for him for three people's feet . And if those three people kids , they're gonna be fine anyway in the back , all together . What they may not like so much , though , is the fact that this window ledges quite high . So for smaller people they'll struggle to see out at least the back windows . Come on , do go all the way down . That's a good thing . Also like this . Look , you've got through loading , Taking Carrie longer items in two people either side . If you need to increase the beats basic be obviously you can't do by putting the seat backs in a more upright position . But I shouldn't bother . Really ? For you , there's a storage .Well , if I could just get this damn it , Come on , that's a bit stiff . There was another innuendo . Didn't know that was accidental . You got some cup holders ? Hey , are you can use it as an arm rest . You've got netting here on the seat backs , but it's not very big , but not much room for stuff . Thankfully , the door bins are absolutely huge . Back here , you got digital climate control as well are like That's a useful feature up here . We've got some coat hooks neatly took away on Look , you've got some reading lights there . You can turn them off individually . And this , um , over this side as well , said that that person sleeping you can read if you want to know . If you want to know more about this , cause practicality .Click on the pop up on the top right corner of the screen on actually more detail on how much stuff you can fit in this car's boot .What it's like with three adults in the back on how easy it is to fit a child .See if you want to charge in mobile devices , you've got 12 . Want socket here ? But look , BMW does this thing where they double the 12 ? What socket ? As to your speech charges , they're really cool . In fact , every BMW that has these I've nicked that and put them in my car . So being too , if you're wondering where they've gone , you know ? So let's move on to the front because there is no real reduction in practicality for this Cooper like body here in the front distance feels like an X ray . And that is why they've given you on X four plaque down there to remind you where your extra money went .Now some of it actually goes towards extra kit because the range kicks off with sport trip and that gets 18 inch Allah wills , leather seats , auto emergency braking and satellite navigation .It's just that the screen only has six inches .That's what most people want to step up to this M6 portrait because then you get these lovely sport seats , you get 19 in General Wells on this glorious 10 inch wide screen entertainment system .It has an extra features over the basic version . So you got traffic updates , which is good as ways really rooting around . The traffic jams really like those the Internet connectivity . I've also got concierge service . I can speak to a man over the phone and he'll actually book hotels . For me , it's really , really good . In fact , I love this system is intuitive , simple to use . You could just wish through all the menus very easily , and you can operate it using this swivel wheel here in the shortcut buttons . That's the best years when you're driving , but when you're stationary , you can use it as a touch screen . So it's just like your smartphone or tablet . If you don't want to do that , you can use gesture controls . Look , you just wave your finger about . You can also in put things into the sat nav using this touch pad . Here , it's a bit hard to in right and drive cars unless you're left handed . So if you actually want to put me into the sat nav , you're better off pressing this button here now that'll activate the voice commands , and apparently it can understand normal speed . So let's just try it . Take me to Spearmint , Rhino , Spearmint , Rhino , London , Tottenham Court Road . Say yes , all select another entry from Milly . Let's not do that right now . You got digital dollars now they're an optional extra , but they're well worth because they're only a couple of 100 quid and they look nice . Okay , so they didn't quite the functionality that you get on the digital dollars that you get . Audi is on Mercedes-Benz . I still like them now for more information on his cars , in for 10 . Insist and click on the pop up on the top right hand corner of the screen , and you also have another good look around this cause cabin .So in terms of design , it's alright , are quite like it said . Its end sport gets things like this satin trim and metallic trim here . This car's got this leatherette on the dash with some stitching , which doesn't make it Phil Pasha . So did these metallic buns here near the climate control on I like these touch sensitive , programmable buttons here as well , while not a kid on the is this ? Look , you've got a CD player . I mean , who listens to see these these days ? And if you look , it's kind of off center , which is kind of doing my head in a little bit . It's a bit like Art Deco starlight Being sat in the 19 twenties in that pattern is mimicked here on the events . It's just a shame that the events feel cheap . The rest of the car that is very solid . Yet everything you touch feels built till last now , qualities generally very good . But as you go low down here to subscribe to plastics on the door pockets and you will touch that if you're gonna demonstrate your view is just how big those door bins are .Because look , they can hold a big bottle of water that's in storage here by the steering wheel for emergency bar of chocolate space and his All right , you got us be import . And I like this . Look , there's a little runner for your cable so it doesn't get snagged . Will you put that down under here ? You got some cup holders and they will hold large bottles like that on a padd there for charging your mobile phone wirelessly . Also , you can use it for charging the key . Go shade is key , so it's 100 �90 this optional K , and it's got a little screen on it , and you can control various things like the lights , the climate control . You can do it remotely . That's kind of good . But if you look at that screen dead , lagging and the key , it's kind of big . And if you've got in your pocket , you're gonna have a bulge there again anyway . Yeah , don't bother with that key . That's why I'm coming to get in the glove box . A8 and okay , size just about a big bag of popcorn on manual .Finally , we're going to talk about the seating position , say , as another BMW . It's really good . I like how you got this extendable seat base from or under fly support . And yes , this is an SUV , but you can see quite low if you want to , or jack it up . Very high view . Short need a better view out . Also , there's plenty of adjustment in the steering wheel , and you can see . But compared to other cars , it seems a telescope just that bit more You seem to get an extra inch .Yeah , I think this video is gonna need an adult rating now . Then it's time for the car . Wow . A5 annoying things about this car .If , like me , you have a bad back . You'll probably want the adjustable lumbar support operate down here .It's a �265 option on A LL Models .For some reason , the one touch function for the sun roof will only open it 90% of the way . If you want to open its full way , you have to press it again .Why ? Federales Two litre diesel really is quite rattling . And look at this exhaust pipe shaking illustrated with his coin .Yeah , I wonder when the penny will finally dropped the BMW bend of his I drive . Maybe brilliant birth while you can get it with apple Carplay . There's no Android auto available at all , sir . Yeah , your should've bought .Is it just me , or does this grill make the car sort of look like a pig from angry birds ? Just I don't worry .There's still plenty to like about this car . Here's the car . Wow , five core features .They might be wondering where the heck you can keep these rather cumbersome low cover as well . Don't you worry , because look at this underneath here . There's some special cutaways for them , so they should fit just perfectly on out of the way . Uh , this car has an active grill , so when the engine doesn't need cooling , it remains shut for improved aerodynamics . Speaking of which , you got air breathers here which actually send air in through there over the wheels for less dragon . As you can see , they do actually exist and go somewhere has proved for the car . One stick of truth .The optional heads up displays . Absolutely brilliant . It shows loads of information in a clear widescreen format , and it can show stuff like satellite navigation directions , speed , distance of a car in front . And you can actually customize it quite a fair bit through the central display Here . Look brilliant . Now you might be wondering why the heck I'm not actually showing you the system . I'm telling you the options on this screen what is because the camera just doesn't pick it up that well , right ?This new S4 is 50 kilos lighter than the old S4 . It's also got perfect 50 50 weight distribution on the 40 I am 40 D models come with an active rear differential for added sported RCR .The parking assistant Plus is absolutely brilliant , says What is the normal range insensitively view . You have a special three devious A5 . Just activate it . If I can , then look at the car . If it's in a computer game and come on , you suggested control . Look around me . Isn't that insane Now ? If I put it back on to auto , it sounds reversing . It will automatically flip up when I get close to an object . So you see a bird's eye view from the top to make sure I don't really move up being an SUV .Of course , he said , higher than in other cars . So get a good view . It makes you feel a bit more smug . Well , I'm not so smug about , though other blind spots in this cocks there are quite a lot of them . I mean , look at this is a huge blind spot . They're the real window . He's tiny . There's another massive one , but the Riera's well . So when you're looking over your shoulder , too polite junctions , it gets in the way in fact , this car has so many blind spots it should really come with a free dog on a white stick .Can't complain about the automatic gearbox , so I really love it . A8 speeds , and it's very smooth . You put your foot down and responds instantly . And if you want to , you can change gears yourself , using the paddles to make it feel a bit more sporty . Actually , BMW specifically said this car up to feel sporty , so they've given it slightly firmer suspension than the X3 on . Do you do notice that round Town ? It just seems to pick up the bumps a bit more . Feel a bit firmer than you might imagine . However , you cannot great twosome , adaptive suspension on that as a comfort mode , and it's only 500E . It is well worth it . So you put into comfort slackens off the suspension on . Then it is better that this car still feels just that little bit Verma to drive . Then say something about the Mercedes GLC coop A . And it's definitely firmer still in the X3 . Now , when you encounter twisty road , you will experience the benefit of this course sporty set up . So if you put into sports mode , it lad , way to the steering shop , the throttle response . And if you got the adaptive suspension , it'll stiffen that up to . And then when you took this thing into a corner , it really doesn't lean it all . It's quite surprising for a tall SUV just how well it handles on this . X four is more fun to drive than the X3 , if ever complain . No , it's a steering . It's not quite a sharp is that in an Alfa Stelvio , you see , you can't be subtle with it . It won't pick up on hints safe . You're like , really like it over there . I'd like to be over there , to the will of it . It just doesn't respond . Say you need to be bloody obvious with what you want . So you want to say , Turn right now and then it does respond on it responds . Well , it's gonna have to treat it .This particular car driving is the 20 day , so it's a two litre diesel engine on . It's generally pretty good . It's got enough performance , not 16 8 seconds and economy . I'm doing 42 miles per gallon , which is good enough . There's two other diesel engines . They're six cylinders . They're more expensive , more powerful , but it didn't work . Extra cash . Really . You can get a six cylinder turbo petrol , which is really fast , but that's expensive and expensive to run S8 mainly wanted . Tomorrow there will be a two litre turbo petrol , which will be more economical and better value for money .In terms of long distance driving , this car is generally quite comfortable . One thing I do notice , though , is that you do get quite a lot of noise from the tire , say competiton . Audi Q5 in part . The reason is because it's running on those run flat tires I mentioned earlier .So be wary of that . This particular car has got the autonomous driving sale stared , keep me and laying . It's got automatic cruise control to keep a safe distance from the car in front on it just takes a strain of doing long distances . It's an option worth considering .This S4 comes with four world drivers standard , which gets a good grip on tarmac , and it means it can go off road of it if you want it , too . In fact , this car can drive three water that's 50 centimetres deep without drowning and that is the same waiting depth that Land Rover defender has .

15,30,5 Series,"the BMW G5 Siri's . Now this is a car which combines comfort with sporting us . In fact , you can think of is the automotive equivalent of a set off box fresh trainers . You see , this is the executive card that aims to please all the people all of the time on extends to the rear passenger rail passengers .They're gonna love it in the back of him because , well , there's lots of Miriam absolutely acres of headroom . This is a really good car for people over six foot here in the back of these cats , leading in terms of the headroom . Slight problem I do have , though , is it's not so good for carrying three abreast in the back . Is the new Mercedes E Class in part ? The reason for that is the seats a little bit higher in the middle . So yeah , I'm still okay for Henry , but it's more the foot room because , well , you got big transmission . Tunnels have to struggle in your in your feet on the runners for the chairs . It's just know that comfy . But , you know , in the front , with your big or small , you're gonna be really , really comfy in this five serious , not the design .You might not have quite the possess of the new Mercedes E Class . But when you look around the cabin , you will not find one single piece of cheap feeling . Plastic , like you will in the city , is It's really nice .Storage is all right . For instance , you got a decent size ical of boxes . Enough room for all those DVD is there , but in other respects is a bit kind of short on could be spaces . I can't fault the equipment . Equipment is really good , So let's start off with the fact that you get satnav standard .You also get leather seats and the heated , outstanding Get Jules and climate control he gets on headlines .It's really , really good .And that's on the S E model , so you don't need to spend extra on the higher trim levels .One thing I would spend extra on , though , is he upgraded professional satnav because you get a widescreen . It's lovely .And then you got Bender Lose . I drive system to control it , and it's a slickest system on the market . And if you click on the right hand corner of the screen on the card , you can see our in depth review of that and have a good look around this car's cabin and you'll see that this design has stood the test of time , I think , and so is the exteriors .Well , I mean , this is a car which are certainly cut the mustard in the corporate car park , and it's got decent size boot as well .Now the overall capacity is slightly less than saying Audi A6 , but it's not bigger deal on this , and things are like about in the way that you've got a very low load lip to lift stuff over . The shape isn't perfect , though , so you can hamper loading just with the way that the wheel arches just intrude into the boots based slight labor On the whole . Yeah , it's It's a practical enough boot for most people if you want to see just how much stuff you can fit in this booth , clicking the top right hand corner of the screen on the card to watch our practicality video , and you'll also be able to see how easy it is to fit a child in the back of this five years and what happened when we tried to squeeze three people in the back seats .For now , though , here's five core things about BMW A5 . Siri's .In an accident , the bonnet pops up to reduce pedestrian head injuries .Internet connectivity allows you to do stuff like checking stocks online . Well , maybe I can afford this , Governor .The BMW phone . I will help you find a car in a crowded car park .If you get Bluetooth office , it will read all your e mails to you while you're driving on meth prints and I have a business proposal for you . Lucky may .If you fight hard enough , windows were automatically close to keep you secure in the pending accident .However , there are some annoying things at at the five Siri's in manual models .The pedals are slightly offset , Z8 twisted behind the wheel .Automatic emergency braking is an expensive option , so some people won't bother to fit it . Whoa , whoa , hold on .Receipts optional . Whoever bought this car clearly don't wanna pay for them on the door bins and really small .For a car of Thrace size lumber support is an expensive option , even on the top spec model .And that's the thing with this car . You'll end up spending Maur than you intended .If you buy a bit of G5 service , there is one option you absolutely , positively have to fit .And that's the adaptive suspension . No , no , it's quite expensive , but it's well worth it , because without it the car suspension on the rides , it just never feels totally settled over bombs . Also , the cars and corner quite as well as you might expect . BMW , too . But if you do have the optional suspension , you press a button on it . Confirmed the suspension upset , feels nice and squatting tour to the corners with no body roll . It'll weaken , really exploit and enjoy that sporty rear wheel drive chassis . And then we just cruising the oppressive . So he goes into comfort mode . It slackens everything off . Then it just slides over bumps in the road . Lovely . Now , apart from that one caveat . This big G5 Siri's .It is lovely to drive , so it's pretty quiet . The only thing that I do know it is you did get wind whistle whipped up at speed from those wing mirrors on the whole year . It is probably not quite serene to travel in a CZ . The new Mercedes E class .Nothing I noticed is that while visibility is generally very good , you get bit of a blind spot from that thick red pillow , which has been paid . When you're pointing out junctions and looking over your shoulder , do you want to save yourself ? Click in the top right hand corner of the screen on the car tow . Watch out 360 degree video .That's for engines . Well , they're all strong performers . If you want petrol power , just go for the 5 to 8 I because it's got plenty performance on dhe . It's reasonably economical for a petrol . But if it is economy you want you need on the two liter diesels and it's best in the 5 20 d because it can go from 0 to 60 in under eight seconds and still return around 65 miles per gallon . On edge in this car is the storming really to diesel gives you decent economy and stellar performance . So not 60 takes under six seconds . You have been to be says it'll return around 54 miles per gallon . They come to district computer . I'm doing around 37 mpg . On the whole , the engine is really good . When you're cruising but when you put your foot down , it's just a little bit more noisy in the diesel engines you get in an Audi A6 . Also , I don't think the manual gearbox you get on the four cylinder BMW A5 service is as nice as the man you get on the Audi once again . So just get the automatic , because the eight speed auto in this five Siri's is one of my favorite on the market .Okay , then . So overall , what ? Don't think that BMW A5 Siri's when it's not the best .McCurry M3 in the back on , you have to spend extra on the option adaptive suspension fit to drive as well as it can . But if you do , it's both fun .Uncomfortable plus as a brilliant entertainment system .If you click up there , you can see some more reviews and find out the best deal . You can get a new car , a car . Wow , Darko , don't you ? Kay ? Thanks for watching .

16,31,M3,"the BMW M3 . I mean , it's an absolute legend . The E 30 from the eighties really set the precedent to which this car has to live up to Canada . In order to do so , this F 80 M3 will have to be fast . We'll have to be fun , and it will have to be capable of running rings around the competition .And speaking of competition , this particular car has the competition pack , and it's a three grand extra and includes 20 rather than 19 inch Allah wills .Retuned dampers springs on anti roll bars for more precise handling . You also have a more lenient traction control system for a bit more fun on a retuned rear differential for added traction when exiting corners , plus a sports exhaust for Maur boom bass Tic exhaust note .The normal M3 starts at �59,000 for the competition pack is �62,000 . But does it feel worthy of this price tag ?For all intents and purposes , this car feels pretty much identical to a normal three . Siri's inside , which is no bad thing . That means the quality's good on . Everything is easy to use place .You got fabulous infotainment system It's one of the best that you can get on the market . The only thing is , they're They're also M3 ink . It's in this car , so m searing Will em dials ? Was he got M gear Lever ? We've also got on this particular car . Some carbon fiber affect tree , which doesn't look tacky .It or it looks really good , and I like these wind back seats now . Super comfy . Write letter . Do you know what on a normal three siris are , Get the on this car . I think it's perfectly acceptable What's also acceptable ? Israel passenger space .But is the boot big enough ? Yes , well , that's a sensible stuff dealt with . Let's crack on with something more fun now .One thing that I didn't tell you about the competition pack was that it also liberates an extra 19 horsepower from the cars . Three litre straight six twin turbo engine now have 40 and 50 horsepower on G550 Newton meters of torque and according to BMW , in this car with a deal clutch D C T automatic gearbox . That's good for naught to 60 in four seconds dead when you use launch control . So let's use launch control to see how fast . This car really is car at 4.4 seconds to 60 . Yeah , that's close enough by this engine . Absolutely stocking it's super responsible , has so much low down punch .Boy may trust flies , but it's pretty relentless . Well , everything is that despite the fact this car's got a sports exhaust , the exhaust is is just a noise that gets louder . It's not really that , but there is more to this car than just straight line performance and exhaust .No one think about the M3 . Is the ID card off handle ? Well , it really does . But there is one problem , except Steven doesn't have all that much field . But the actual grip of the front end is really strong on Got the back end , though it's still quite easy to you . Lose traction if you put your foot down . Turn Yes , huge towers . Slides are possible when he turned drivers A8 off . However , if you want to just drive around like a normal person , you can A3 this M3 . I can also lots of different settings independently so I can change the throttle response between three modes . The suspension between sport plus , which is different from the road around the track sports , which is too far from the road and not five minutes from the track or comfort , which is not far from the track on DDE . Still a little bit too firm to tell you the truth , but just about okay , I guess I can also change the way the steering gear for sport doesn't like . Change the ferocity of the shifts of the automatic gearbox between three stages , and I'm gonna go full of ferocious because I want this car during cites me on . Then it does even more so , said M3 , is a car you can set up just as you like . It makes it easier to live in every day .And you might think , No , I've actually spent quite bad time of this car , and he's a great all rounder really is . But the race one thing above all , allows it . Just get someone else about it . I don't know if you've noticed it yourself yet , but I mean , can you hear that ?That constant roar from the tyres , it's just it's way too loud ready like this is the only major criticism , and he can forgive the M3 in this one failing when you consider all the things that it does do . So then this M3 is a fantastic all round performance car . It could do it all a bit like the ether M3 anything . Is that the 30 M3 Waas ? The best car ? It's time forcefully . This isn't no quite . It's just edged out by the new Alfa Giulia quarter folio . Still , it's a great guy if you want any German , so that feels really well made . It's a great choice now .

It's fun to drive on DDE . It can also go off road well to a fashion .It's also very practical as well . So get in the back .

If you want cupholders there , that's none of this car comes to split folding rear seats , but your picture to have three way split so you can load this central part here if you want to carry ski's and maybe two people back at the same time , or even large pieces of timber . If you want to carry three people in the back , it's not about either . Yes , you do have this big humping the floor , but the football's a large because quite wide on , so it is doable .

Review of this car , and that brings us on to the boot .The boots on this car is absolutely massive on our standard . You get an automated tailgate , though , if you're impatient like may I ? Yeah , you . You'll end up confusing it . Sometimes I think it's easier to just do that . Okay , Like I was saying , the boot is very large . It's a nice square shape as well , and you get with things like adjustable tether points . Lots of nets , straps , hawks . Andi . I like the fact that Parcel Shelf you just flip it to remove it , which is handy , was not so good is that you can only fall down the seats using the leaves on the top of this seat's clever release mechanisms at the back . But you did get a flat lobe A8 with no load lip , which is great threesome under floor storage there , but unfortunately it won't fit the parcel shelf , so you really got nowhere to put this .Excuse me , A wallet more still holding this thinking so nothing that are not so keen on their S8 is the design . I know it's desirable . Of course it's desirable . It's a BMW , but I just think it's one of their least attractive models . It's just not a sharp looking as a Mercedes GLC , and it's the same story , I'm afraid with the inside . So the interior design , it just looks a little bit dated . I can't fault the build quality , though this feels like a solid car on in . Car storage is good as well . There's lots of cover is dotted about the place and equipment that's impressive as well .For when you really need is the SC model cause it's got pretty much everything . You get leather seat to get parking sensors .You also get satellite navigation on you . Operate it using the swivel will and touch pad system known as I Drive on .

Well , bad look , you don't get petrol .Version's X3 in the UK is this annoying phone cradle thinking it's just eats into the central cubby Margins may look cool but they absolutely knackered the ride quality .You've been warned you can solve this problem with the optional adaptive suspension . Actually , that set of is pretty essential on all models , because BMW has given this car a fairly firm suspension on it rides a little bit too bumpy , I think , for an SUV , but on the flip side , it does actually handle very well . But if you got the adoptive dump is you get the best of both worlds . You get a comfort mode on you get a sportsman , and then you can really X6 employed this cause It's rather surprising grippy handling .When you're not hooting it around , it's reasonably quiet that you do get quite a lot of Tyrell when you going at speed .

But if you do that , make sure your grade to the automatic gearbox , which is standard on this 30 day . Because our auto is brilliant , it's arrogance , the best in the business on Dwell BMW's manuals .

18,35,X5,"now , this is not a very normal way to start a car review , but then this isn't a particularly normal BMW X5 because it's actually a plug in hybrid version . Now they're trying to fall over to feel a bit dizzy after doing that .Now , you might be interested in this car if you don't want diesel , but you still want good economy . One thing you have to be aware of those is that all the electrical staff the batteries for the hybrid system is stored under the boot .So that means that , well , boot capacity is about 1/4 less than the normal X5 place . You can't get a seven seater version cause there's nowhere to put the seats . You do have a little bit of storage area there , which is probably just about big enough to hold your spare battery pack for your phone . But you do get a flat lovelorn , really like the fact you got this split tailgate as well . It does make it easy to slide things straight into the back on DDE in April with you have to put it back up if you wanna fold the rear seat backs down . Yes , Did it And then , as you can see , you get a flattish low bay . You can't side items all the way to the back .Now one of things I like about this car is the space in the back seat . So I put these in their original position . Leave across Now there's loads of knee room . There's loads of head room . Also , you get three way folding seats so you can carry two passengers and skis through this hatch if you want to . A slight problem with this car , though , is you can't recline the seat backs and concert slide the base that you can in a Lexus RX 4 50 h , but this is after the best car . It's God's pretty much for three in the rear because this seat , it's about the same height as the outer ones . You got a pretty much flat floor and look in the middle with three people . Absolutely fine . If you want further proof that that you can click up there on the car to watch our in depth practicality videos , what's up with three people in the back of this car ?How easy it is to fit a baby , seeing just how much stuff you can fit in the boot at this BMW X5 .So let's move into the front of the car because it's just a spacious as the rear . That is no problem .What is is the fact that , well , yes , competitive of its rivals . This car is a little bit dull here on the inside . It really is starting to show its age . Ah , conflict the quantity , though I mean where the touch There's always some soft touch material . It does feel very high quality . There's not any doctor . Better trim to let it down , and you can't find anything that seems cheap . It's a very , very expensive feeling car .It's also got very good storage spaces as well . Pretty much you got huge door bins you can fit easily . One big ball into this room for another bottle and some or if you want , and equipment's pretty good .So right across the reins you get things like electrically heated leather seats .You also get this premium satnav there that with the wide screen , the professional system , and it's just so lovely to you .BMW I drive . I've said it so many times in all my reviews , it's one off the best systems , if not actually the best system on the market to use , absolutely love it now . If you want to see our fall in depth review of it , you can click up there on the card on .Also in that video , you can have another look around this car's company .Now , though , it's time to hit the road to see what the interview X5 . On the whole , this big Dave X5 drives really really nicely . You can get it with a choice of different suspensions , and I reckon you should go for the adaptive M6 port suspension because when you have it in comfort mode , it's nice and relaxing . But you press a button down here , going to sports mode on me . When it stops , any kind of body roll improves the grip , and this thing just handles surprisingly well for such a tall , big , heavy vehicle . Now S8 handles really well .It does so long as you don't have this hybrid model because with a ll the batteries in the motor that go with the hybrid system , you add a lot of weight 250 kilograms on .That does make the car feel more cumbersome in the corners , so just get the normal one .Another problem is a hybrid system itself . Right . So you got electric motor on board this car Andi compound R8 for up to 90 miles at speeds of up to 75 miles an hour . The only problem is that if you want a sudden burst of acceleration and you put your foot down , they're not to a turbo petrol engine . Four cylinder for the Mini Cooper s kicks in , and it doesn't make what I wear are strained noise . BMW claims that you should be out to get 85 months , but gallon according to trick computer , I'm only doing 35 miles per gallon on really , You should be able to get similar economy from the three litre diesel engine you can get in this car , and it suits you much better .What's really well , with the automatic gearbox on , it's It's quicker as well .Anything is that when you compare it to a three litre diesel from rival manufacturers , it is still a little bit noisy . In fact , on the whole , this X5 is quite a loud car traveling . Get lots of Tyrell ties just so huge on this quite the wind whistle as well , which can be annoying . It's speed .One thing I comfort , though , is the visibility so large back window you should be able to see as well as the wide angle of this camera one that rip pillars aren't that obtrusive that don't create too much of a blind spot . You can see further detail on that by clicking out there to watch my in depth , 360 degree video Audi Mobile phone move the phone around . He should have a look around the cabin .So on the whole , the X5 is rather good to drive , but it does have some annoying traits .Here's five of them .There's a necessary large gets a little excited that you might find on and summer store . Thisted phone Cradle just eats into this country special . Whose line is it anyway ?Reversing camera .You have to spend �400 extra on every single modern .It's not standard Parcel Shelf is so heavy you can use it to train your biceps .These wide retired may look pretty me , but they're cost up to 500 quid each to replace .However , this still plans to like about the X5 Here's some of its cooler features .The traffic date on the SAT nav is super accurate , and it's updated every three minutes . Definitely see you write .Our models get self leveling Air suspension at the back of a split tailgate can hold up to 250 kilos . They can use it as a viewing platform at the races .The Colt Automatic canister with the reactions of a pro rally driver to help prevent a skid .The optional thermal night vision can spot things in the road of 300 meters away , and it will illuminate them . The fog lights .So then overall , what I think this BMW X5 was quite interesting .How this hybrid version is completely silent at low speeds . It's just a shame .The all mortals are quite noisy at high speed on their intense just seemed a little bit dated .But you know , this is a hugely practical car on diesel version .It's very good to drive click up .They can get more information on reviews on various different cars and find out the best deal .You can get a new car , a car , wow dot co dot uk .Thanks for watching you know this video please share it and subscribe .

19,36,X5,"This is the new BMW X5 in this video . Gonna drive it , check out its practicality , look around its interior , try its new entertainment system . Take it off road . I'm also gonna test drive the 50 d The 30 day on the 40 I . I'm also gonna have a look at its ancestors . They have to bear with me this video , guys , because I'm holding the camera myself . So , yes , it could be a little bit interesting .Now let's start this review by talking about the design . The most distinctive feature on this card is that absolutely huge grill . Look at it . It's like bugs , bonus teeth . It's massive . Now the grill will open it when engineers cooling . When it doesn't need cooling , it shuts to improve aerodynamics .In fact , you've got these events here which are actually there to do a job . They send air in there and out here , so it smoothes over the front wheel . Ross invents here down the side , but these lead to know where they are . Fake shame or new BMW .Now , the front of this car looks very aggressive . This is the M 50 days has got full end sport trim on it .this one's got laser lights with some cool blue inserts . There . There you go , laser lights running on 21 inch Allah wills .You got the upgraded M breaks there as well , with blue paint on them down the sides and skirts to make it look like it's hugging the road like the real lights as well .New design .Not so sure about the back end . It's a bit slab like , isn't it ? Rather large ?Let's have a look at the interior . Gonna pop the boot ? All electric , of course , and you have a split tailgate . The bomb part is electrical as well . The boot is a nice big square shape . Some extra storage under there as well . No spare will . This car is obviously on run flats on Dhe . Pull these levers here . I can lower the back seats . There we go . Very easy to do . And then I could just pop up the tailgate and then shut . That's up , off .That's a quick look around exterior , The new BMW X5 . Now , why do you tell me which car you prefer ? The look off this BMW X5 the Range Rover sport , the Porsche Cayenne or the new Audi Q . wait on the pop out there in the top right hand corner , the screen to cast a vote .Now , don't be interesting to compare the look of the new G5 version of the X5 to its predecessor , So I have them here . Let's go check him out . This is where it all began back in 1999 with the original X5 , which is code named the E 53 . Now the car was built until 2600 replaced by this car , the A 70 the second generation version . That car was replaced with this the F 15 which appeared in 2013 . Now , which is your favorite old BMW X5 ? Let me know in the comments box below .The biggest difference between the previous X5 on this new one isn't the exterior . It's the interior , which now has more luxury on technology than ever .Though of course , this has bumped up the price a bit . The new BMW X5 start from �57,000 on this M5 50 day as he costs over 70 grand . So make sure you click on the pop out banner in the top right hand corner of the screen to get a car right so much you can save on a new car .The big question is , though , does this new X5 feel worth that money ? And I have to say , in a word , yes . Quality is absolutely brilliant . The soft touch materials even down here here , Andi , all the way down on the door , Been . In fact , the softest Dorman's I have ever felt feels great , really sturdy as well . And the desires and ice is quite simplistic . All year . Controls are easily laid out there , like the fact the ventilation controls a metallic . He's still got some shortcut touch sensitive buttons here underneath . It's all very nice . Not so keen on this . Trim though the pants a little bit confusing . It's almost like one of those magic eye posters where if you stir it long enough , you'll probably see a dolphin , which isn't ideal when you're driving . No big fan of this crystal gear knob , either . It's all a bit naff if you ask me , come for the States .I S8 lovely , and a lot of two tone leather in this car looks really , really good .Taking part of place , though , is the new infotainment system , so it's BMWs . I drive seven , and it's better than ever . It's absolutely fabulous . It's dead . Easy to control . You can swipe through the different menus down the side here , using the swivel Will Andi . Then , if you want , you can use it as a touch screen and slide through this slates like that . You can also operate it with gesture commands a lot . So that's a volume . Come on , come on that we can Finally , as you can see , it's a little bit temperamental . There we go . Turned it down there . End of just using the North . It's just easier card for the graphics on the screen that I mean , look at that map . It is lovely . Look at that . It's just high definition on then some , because it looks like that image has been spray painted on . Doesn't like graphics ? It's that sharp . Also , the system includes a full digital drivers display . Now I don't think it's quite good to someone that you can get in an Audi Q . A8 because you can't have full wide screen satnav it there . You just have it in between the two dials . Also , the Rev counter runs backwards , like in Persia . Don't want BMW doing that . It's a little bit odd , but it's totally okay , and it shows lots of different information , and you can cycle through things just yes , stereo on DSI things , that engine boost and how much talk it's producing and G force . And yeah , who needs all of that ? I do like this . They're looking is going to start the car . The dolls . Come on , there's a picture of the car . I like the reversing camera so good so I can go into three D mode and then you get like a computer digital image of the car . It's a bit like a video game that I can use . The gesture controls like that once again . A bit hit and miss is quite hard control with the gesture commands , but you can look around the car's pretty needs . Anything is lacking , really , is the fact that this still doesn't do Andhra Little Toe . You can only get Apple carplay with it . Thanks for that BMW . Half of all mobile phone users then weren't built to connect their phones fully .Hopefully , the way the new X5 drives is enough to make up for this mold and winds , so the X 50 d has its own unique suspension set up . It's got coil springs with adaptive dampers . Andi . They are set up a little bit firmer than the other . Cars are getting comfort mode in the moment , and it does feel very , very comfortable . It's gonna hiding out . Bums doesn't jump around too much . Just went over there . I could hardly feel it . Press this button put into sport , and then it adds weight to the steering improves the throttle response . It's different at the suspension . On it adds a bit of a fruit stand exhaust . You know what A8 in sport , the Roy doesn't seem really much worse . It's very , very good . This one actually has the active anti roll bars proper with side , which would normally lean down to stop the car rolling so much in the corners . And it does . It feels really sporting agile you at the same time , really strong , sturdy on a bit of a beast . Taxi drive . It's great . I think they've got it spot on . They have blended comfort with performance brilliantly . With this car , steering is a highlight . If you compare this thing like an Audi cue aides , which has doing this a little bit kind of dead . This does feel like it's connected to the front wheels onto the road so you can tell what's going on . One thing I will complain about those that change modes . You have to ridge between the two front seats on feely , away to the buttons . They end up looking down . When you want to go in sport , when really you want to look at the road , not down here . I just don't know why the controls aren't on the steering wheel . Lock there on the M cars just makes so much more sense now .One thing I need to show you is the performance from this 50 d engine . So it's a three litre straight six diesel , but he's got four turbochargers , and as a result it has 400 horsepower . So I'm gonna launch it now . Really , we go build us a boost , let it go . Oh , that's pretty quick for diesel S60 lot . It's very quick . North S60 is 5.2 seconds , but that isn't the whole story . What is is if I put into manual mode and I hold into a gear on about 50 now and I just floor it . The way this thing picks up , it's just relentless because it's got 760 new two meters of talk . Makes a good noise as well .Kind of stands a bit like a V8 , not a straight six . But then that noise you're hearing is fake . It's plumbed into the speakers . The gearbox is really good as well , so it's the usual A8 speed , said F . But they changed it to make it even better . That's a bit like improving on perfection . I don't have that done it , but they've done it well done . BMW . And of course , you can change gears yourself using the paddles . It's really sharp when you do that . As with all modern cars , there's an array of driver assistance systems and you get the latest ones from BMW hair .So I'm gonna put the car into cruise control with steering assess laying , keeping assessed distance control to keep a safe distance from the car in front Step came in lane , by the way , has these their lights that flash up on the steering wheel if you let go of it . And those are the warning signs there , as well as the warning up there on the dash , telling me to put my hands back on the wheel . But I'm not gonna do that . And this is what happens if I don't get flashing red lights there and then it's gonna auto brake the car . There we go . It's auto breaking it now , and it's Audi jolting as it's doing it to just wake me up . Let's stop me because there's nothing behind me . And now take over . There we go . So that's safe . It keeps you in lane and it doesn't disengage . It actually brings you to a steady and safe stop and not do something that the car behind my crushing to you this'll be particularly bad if you have passengers in the back seats .Speaking of which , what is the new X5 like in the rear ? So you can probably see for yourself that there is absolutely loads of room . The guy's driving is over six foot tall , yet look loads of space for my legs . Oh , it'll be fine back in . Look at my head , rivers . There's loads . Looking up absolutely loads . It feels really spacious . You got big windows lead . You can lean off these seats . They are super comfy . In fact , there's lots of creature comforts back here . So you got digital .Jules . Own climate for passengers . You've also got us BC imports That's nice and modern for the latest smartphones got really tough , really strong pockets in the back of the seats . Heavy old laptop , those and it could hold in place . No problem at all . Then these these little sliding bits here , which you can fit some attachments to that . It's a hawk . Hang things off , and then there's another one here for your coat hanger . I'm sure you can fit some of the stuff there as well . IPads .My disappointment is , I can't actually reply in this seat , but it's not too much of a problem because the seats are quite reclined anyway . So if you want to have a sleep , you could quite easy back here because it's super quiet and really , really very comfortable .In the UK , most people won't buy the 50 days , but the 30 day So I jumped into one Detroit Act .It uses a similar three litre diesel , but with just one turbot and therefore has 264 horsepower . On this guys is the effect on acceleration compared to the 50 day . Really , though the 30 day is easily quick enough .Also , it gets air suspension , so it's even more comfortable over bumps in the sport of 50 day plus , even raise the right height by 40 millimeters if you want to go off road . Speaking of which , I think will just go off road here , So I'm gonna press the button to raise at the suspension . Let's raise it up . And now I have a little girl driving over here .Not really sure , Short and I'm in America where they sometimes shoot you if you trespass on their land .Well , also , you get this car with a special off ro pack on this car has its It has some special settings for the four wheel drive system on for the rear differential , so it improves the grip on your off roading . Plus it includes some underbody clouding , so you don't damage the engine when you're off roading and some of the bits and pieces as well . Actually I'm getting a little bit worried about driving over here , so I think I might just turn around and get out of here . It's not to you about If you want to go off roading . And really , most people who buy an X5 probably won't be doing any more extreme off roading than this . That's not a man with a gun . Let's get out of here . I'm gonna put the suspension into low setting against . Some might need the handling prowess to get away from him and his pick up . Come on . Yeah . Huh ?I thought it wise to switch cars more time , just in case I've been spotted on followed .Finally , I'm in the 40 I , so it's got a three litre straight six turbo charged petrol engine with 340 horsepower . Could not 60 in just 5.5 seconds . And it's a nice engine . This it's responsive . Doesn't the punch of the 50 day , but it's nice is revving it . Let's coughing a bit lighter , more agile as well . Probably a little less way to the nose . I've always liked BMW six Linda petrol engines silky smooth , and this is no exception .So that was my final verdict on the new BMW X5 . Well , I must say , I'm really impressed with it , you know , drives very well .It's comfortable .It's quiet , it's luxurious . It's practical .It's packed full of technology .

20,37,3 Series,"This is the new BMW three Siris on in this review , I'm gonna see what it's like to drive test its technology Hey , Mercedes and damage to the car that BMW will forgive me onto myself . I'll even uncover a rare fault . I tried it three times on time . The new M3 40 eyes acceleration over 1/4 mile . How close is it to that A3 ?Since the three serious has launched in 1975 BMW has sold 50 million worldwide , so the seventh generation version has a lot riding on it . But have they got the design right ?I really like the look of the front end of this new three . Suze . I think it's got loads of presents . As before , S4 cars have a more aggressive lower from bumper . There's some other models that you can get like a luxury , which doesn't look quite so good on a sport which is like halfway in between . So yet M6 port is where it is that really the lights as well . This one has integrated laser lights with the rangers in like , 500 meters , and they have , like the four circular design like you had on the E 46 A3 . Siri's really nice . I do like the front and decreasing the bottom . Look good down the sides , though I'm not quite so sure there's various lines increases going about the place . It looks a little bit Slaby . Look , the door handles there kind of is weird . Big cutaways . This would look so called pop out handles that even gets in it like a Range Rover Evoque down the back of the Hoffmeister King , which is a BMW classic design trait that it's three D . Now that looks pretty cool . I like the back . It looks good . This three D like design . You got two different tones of plastic there . It's very , very cold . And once again you have a different design for the rear end . For this M sport model has a diffuse ary effect down there . The lesser versions aren't quite so cool looking back , But is there any good front ? Good , rare , not so great down the sides on ending , but what do you think about the design ? Click on the pop out back in the top right hand corner , the screen to vote , which you think looks the best . This new three siris Mercedes-Benz the Audi A4 or the Tesla Model three .The new three series is 76 millimeters longer and 16 millimeters wider than before , but it's improved in other ways to the center of gravity . Is 10 millimeters lower to improve cornering dinner one like gamma list ? Guess it's supposed to illustrate loneliness .No , I can't bend it . That's not surprising , because body rigidity is up by 50% 3 series is more aerodynamic than ever that this car has a drag coefficient of 30.23 C deem meeting to you through an engineer . Basically , for normal people , it's just more aerodynamic than any other car in its class . Listen , A3 Siri's is up to 55 kilos lighter than the old car Plus for the boot .Well , it's the same size for Geneti liters .Good enough , However , elsewhere inside , there has been some growth . This knee three serious has a slightly long well based on the old one . So as a result , there is more room here in the back seat . So my driver , Jack , is he's about six foot one on . Look , I still got plenty of knee room here . I'm just over five foot 10 and I got plenty of head room A3 become for you and spacious . Yeah , I'm happy I'm happy . And then there's the fact that this car is noticeably quieter than the old three Siri's . So they fitted it with an acoustic windscreen to keep that wind noise out . They've also put way more sound any materials throughout the car , so you don't get that tire noise either . So much more relaxing to traveling with you in the front or here in the back , right mate ? New BMW three series starts from just under �34,000 but if you click on the pop , I abandon the top right hand corner of the screen on the lake below the video , you can see how much you can save on one a car .Wow , this A3 serious has been to leave latest driving aids , so I've got the cruise control set , Teoh kilometres and now it's got the auto steer on and it's tearing me round this bend quite confident late in certain countries , you know , let's take hands off the wheel so the car will warn you about that and tell you to put your hand on the world gets a little lights flashing on Dhe . Eventually he'll get cross like up on the system will disengage , and it's gonna bring me safely to stop in lane . In certain countries , such as China , the system won't disengage when you take your hands off the wheel too long , because it's perfectly legal to do that . If you have the system in the car . But in England allowed to , however , I figured out a way around it . You cannot trick the card to thinking you're holding the steering wheel if you just want your knee slightly underneath it , and then you can just drive along with hands off as if you're in China . If you think that this tech is clever , you're gonna love the new reversing assistant , which I'll demonstrate now As you're driving along a lower speed , the car is automatically remembering your steering import , so it against reason it like crowded carriage R8 tighter City Street . It's knowing what I'm doing logging what I'm doing with the steering . So let's just say someone like that to people . BMW driver blocks your route and they've won the standoff , and you've got to go back when you put the car into reverse , you press a button . It will go into steering assistant mode and I just take my hands off the wheel and I control the throttle in the brakes . But the car will play my staring in reverse to get me out off the gap . Or it won't work like that in a white and work . Mmm .No , it's definitely not working . Let's try that again . Oh , look , I wasn't expecting that . It's an angry man . Let's reverse out of here . Can it do it this time ? Here we go .It is staring the well this time . Is it ?No , Let's go again . It will be third time . Lucky bla bla blast steering blah , blah , blah Remembering stuff blah , blah blocked height , city streets on car parking garages Oh , look ! Once again , Surprise way . Go ! Reverse reversing Assistant , please Work .Work . You need to turn now . You're not gonna turn now .No , no , no .So I've now swept into another car . That's my car over there . We're gonna make you work in this one .Oh , look , I've got his car so he can people , let's carry on with the enactments are put into reverse goingto reversing assistant , please work otherwise it something to do with me because this car was working and it's working this time . Look at this . So it's staring the wheel and it's basically retracing my inputs , but in reverse . So this is gonna be much easier than trying drive out yourself . So there we go . The system works . Now I've got a point out . Yeah , it didn't work on that car , but sometimes you get problems . These are early cars . It's just a weird one off glitch . But still look out that the tech is great and I'll show you a war . You might want it . You see the scratches here , look , that's her where they are now . I did those when I was actually reversing the car out myself when the system wasn't working . That's perfect example of why the reversing A8 is really , really good , because it stopped it in this kind of thing . I mean , if I see more of a panic , the damage could have been even worse . BMW will forgive me . Thankfully , BMW staff did forgive me , and they even let me try it some more new tech on another car . If you get the three Siri's with comfort access , you can have BMW used phone key . So it's basically key on your phone and it uses NFC technology , and we have to do is just hold the phone near the handle and look , it opens and you can get into the car simple .Once you're in , you just put the phone there on the wall is charging pad , and then you get blue lights and charge your phone . But then you can use the phone to start the car . Now , this is a little bit older about this because , well , it's very clever . This only works with android phones . If you have an apple phone , you don't have NFC . So you need to get a special court off BMW to do the same thing . Bizarrely , though BMW used don't work with Android Auto infotainment system . But it does work with Apple Carplay so you can use Android for some things on Apple for others . Why is that ? I know what I'm gonna do . I am going to call the concierge service to find act the reason .Yeah . Listen , I've got a question for you . Why is it that you can use an android phone with the BMW key to get into the car . Yeah , I can't use Android auto .Uh , I can't help you with this question . I'm going to trust value to a colleague of mine . He's an expert .I'll spare you guys the boring conversation . But basically , he said BMW is working to offer Android auto on its car soon . And to be honest , you don't really need it as their latest . I drive into base is just so good and easy to operate as you can control it with the Swiffer wheel with shortcut buttons with a track pad with the touch screen with gesture controls on . Even with normal speech , the system is pretty much the same as you get in the latest Mercedes-Benz you activate . It is pretty much identical to So you go . Hey , BMW . Hello . What can I help you with ? No . Have a bit of fun with this Change the activation word . Please say my new personal activation word . Hey , Mercedes , I'd say the personal activation 10 okay . So I'm not going to use the system to control various functions . So hey , Mercedes-Benz richer to 28 degrees , I set the temperature in the front seat passengers area on 28 degrees Celsius . Why did it from sick passenger ? But there we go . Then you can also use it to activate the navigation system . So Hey , Mercedes , I'm hungry . Which one of the destinations shall I select ? Look , it's got a selection of restaurants . Non of them , I think . Don't take my fancy . One more thing . Excuse me , love . One more thing to do is Hey , Mercedes , I'm tired . What you do is preset the car for an energizing like kind of music . It turns the air con lo to try and wake me up . Get me more energized So don't fall asleep . If you've got a sudden reef , open the sunroof . This is really fun . It's actually changing the air conditioning , blasting it on enough to help wake me up . I've also got some green ambient lighting about the place the once again try and invigorate may . Now let's say I don't want that . I'm in a bit of a kind of bad mood . Then we'll do something different . So hey , Mercedes , I'm stressed , all right . And now what it's done is changed its setting . So it's port , the temperature , but an ambient temperature . We've got some cooler , more relaxed music . We've got some yellowish on being lighting on . If the sunroof was open , it would shut it to kind of keep the noise out and help calm me down . Listen to this soothing music is designed to calm you down , which is handy as the new digital drivers display did wind me up a bit . Because the Rev . Counter runs backwards . Like in a Persia minded , this layout frees up space in the center of the screen for decent size satin Obama on Railly .The rest of the cabin is very well thought out . First of all , the way the the dash and the center console is angled towards it away Sit low . The positioning of the steering wheel . It just feels really sporting . Great to sit in And then everything just well laid out a super logical . So all the buttons for , like , the I drive and you're driving most . They're all here on this warm partners , not things dotted about the place hysteria controls are there in the ventilation controls there . Then you got your window switches . Hey , others I was buying may all carry on , though , because I'm a professional on . Then you've got your switches on your steering wheel there . You know , it's simple , plain Andi Z8 Good work .BMW the new three . Siri's appears to be more luxurious than its competition . But to ensure that everything is exactly as it seems , I'm gonna perform two very important tests .The first is the car . Wow . Flick test . So I'm gonna use this to illustrate just how plush the materials are here in the three series of coming here on the dash . Look , no problem it so down here . No problem . It'll even the glove box cover . No problem at all from the door over here . Actually , there's that brewing fly . Yeah , revenge didn't hurt . May have hurt him , so yeah , really . Software around . Only down here is a bit hard . It's a bit sore on Dhe up here . Ah , really hurt .That's probably comma for that dead mosquito . The second test involves the car . Wow . Stick of truth . So these vents here ? Mmm . Do they lead anywhere ? Yes , they do . These down here in the side . They do too . They lead somewhere . It's good . Now , the grill ? No , that doesn't lead anywhere . But that's because that grill stay shut . Lets the engine needs cooling and then it opened . So , at the front ? Yeah , it's It's a little right here at the back , though . We have the most important test . Look at this . Really Exhaust pipes . Weldon BMW . None of that . Audi A Mercedes fake exhaust pipe . Nonsense . The women actually look . Oh , dear , oh , dear . Look .There's a fake bed boy . He just route at the last moment with a fake friends .Okay , so I may have overreacted a bit , but I really will lose it . If BMW has ruined the three series is driving experience . So how's it ? I'm really impressed with how this new A3 Siri's handles . It's so good on the steering is very , very sharp . You just point it where you want to go on dhe squirt , they want to create the sportiest Sport Saloon on . They definitely have . Now , one of the reasons for the wear handles is it's got some special dampers , which makes it even more sporting on the sport model . The suspensions , even stiffer question is , though , what exactly has that done for the comfort ?Gnawing on a large BMW would fit the large cars with the adaptive suspension which have a comfort mode But this time they've been brave . Just has the normal suspension set of this car . So how does it cope over these bumps ? Well , that's all right . What do reckon , Jack ? No bad cameraman approves as well , and he's very picky .This particular car driving is the 3 30 I . So I've got two liter turbocharged engine . It has 258 horsepower , and it's nice and smooth . Makes a decent sound . It's got plenty of pulling power like it works well , this automatic gearbox , so you can leave it in drive , and it'll blur the gear together really well when you just cruising .But I like to be manually controlling myself , using these paddles that they do feel a bit plasticky .Still , I'll forgive him to be those paddles for one simple reason . You can also get the car with a limited slip differential , which is , you know , actually this or think . Also , it helps with Rex T attraction .Most people will be less interested in burning tires , arm or interested in burning less fuel . So I jumped into the diesel model to do some proper consumer journalism . So this is the 3 20 day got two litre four cylinder diesel . As in the old car , it's got 100 90 horsepower . But now this engine has two turbochargers , so it's just a bit smoother the way the power builds . It's a place , however , if it's performance rather than an economy that you're after . There's the M3 40 I X Drive and I got to try a camouflage preproduction model on track . This car has It's really too straight . Six Turbo charged petrol engine with 382 horseback is actually the American version . European one has a few horsepower less for various reasons . Gonna launch it and see what I can do a standing quarter time in I recently drag raced a BMW M3 cs on it . It's only quarter in 12.2 seconds once their clothes and get with this car . So here we go . I'm gonna launch it and see what we get .Good stall . Come on , fails . Quick . It was really quick . How close is it to that M3 ? What's all ?So did the study quarter mile in 12.6 seconds , which is less than half a second slower than that M3 CS . Let's see what we've got . Not 16 BMW say Z4 160.4 seconds there says 4.2 BMW lied , but we'll forgive them because they lied in the right direction .Speaking of which , with BMW is the right direction can also be sideways , even in sure footed ex drive models . Yes , this may be four wheel drive , but you go to the different modes . It sends more power to the rear . So when you combine that with the M sport differential , you can have a bit of fun in this car .You can slide it .You think you might not be able to in a four wheel drive , but you can .It's just classic BMW . But is this car a classic A3 ? Siri's , in other words , the best sports saloon you can buy . Well , it's great to drive . It's got loads of tech . It feels really expensive inside . It's practical . It's comfortable on it's unmistakably a three siris . Yes , BMW have nailed it . Enjoy this video , please like it , Comment on it and share it .

21,38,i8,"Ever since the Z8 roadster waved its final goodbye in 2003 sports car enthusiast have been patiently awaiting the arrival of BMW is next performance . Halo Car . The German automaker could have played it safe and developed another no holds bar supercar like the Audi R8 Lexus L affair Mercedes-Benz s a less but instead BMW double dad on their efficient dynamics engineering philosophy and produce this A8 looking like something straight out of an ad sponsored sci fi film . The main story Behind the eye . It comes down to 24 thinking technologies , a lightweight carbon fiber reinforced plastic body and a sophisticated plug in hybrid powertrain . Holding it all together is an aluminum drive module , which is simply BMW's fancy way of saying chassis .Completing this oven guard formula are vertical opening scissor doors because nothing says progressive .Like a 40 year old concept , the eye A8 doesn't look futuristic just for the sake of it . Virtually every design element serves a purpose , like this functional hood vent Ah , front apron port that creates an air curtain around the front wheels to help reduce drag . A rear intake channel , it provides air to the three cylinder gas engine and this rear balance that well , I think that's just for show .Inside high quality reusable materials intertwined with clear contrasts and blue accents to form the most contemporary representation of BMW is current design . Aesthetic shell type front seats and chemically hardened glass further emphasize the eye . It's lightweight nature , but as a great man , never said with great weight savings come great responsibility .Not surprisingly , the eye it is in the most practical car on the road . The rear seats aren't suitable for anyone other than small children and skilled contortionists and cargo space consists of those two seats and the small cubby hole back here .That's it .By the same token , the weight conscious front seats offer only six way adjustability lumbar support , not being one of them .Then again , most consumers in the market for $137,000 sports car have alternative forms of transportation at their disposal , making the matter of everyday versatility a non issue .Changing her focus to the realm for which it was designed by A8 accelerates and handles a BMW should exceptionally composed at high speeds , the eye A8 also carves the corners with a surgeon's precision . This stereo system is truly unique in that it's quite possibly the only electric assistant set up that elicits no criticisms for me regarding feedback are waiting . I think it's fair to say BMW has officially cracked the code on electric steering . Brace yourselves . The Iet's electromechanical steering is so responsive and effortless that hydraulically actuated set up what actually detract from the experience . Deep breaths .In terms of running gear , the eye A8 pairs an internal combustion engine that drives the rear wheels with an electric motor generator unit energized by a lithium ion battery that powers the front wheels . Combined output is 357 horsepower in £420 feet of torque for claim , 0 to 60 time of 4.2 seconds . Better yet , BMW tune the exhaust note of the turbo charged three cylinder engine to admit the baritone Barkalow V8 . Sure , you could have had a V8 , but this is better for a number of reasons , the first being efficiency . Following a 3.5 hour charge on a standard 110 volt household outlet , 1.5 hours with a 220 volt charging station , V8 can travel roughly 22 miles on electricity alone at speeds of up to 75 miles per hour before the conventional engine kicks in to deliver an extra 300 miles of range . We logged 18 miles of all electric driving in real world conditions , meaning the eye . It delivers the straight line acceleration of a BMW m four with the efficiency of a Ford C . Max Energi . No , not at the same time powers ratted to the front wheels , rear wheels or anywhere in between through a hyper intelligent own wheel drive system made it to a lightweight six speed automatic transmission .All told , the BMW A8 weighs in at less than £3300 nearly £200 lighter than the Audi R8 .Over 80% of BMW dealerships in the U . S will sell and service the eye A8 . As for pricing BMW , I A8 opens it writer on $137,000 not including up to $5000 in state and federal tax rebates .Standard features include a Harman Kardon premium sound system , 20 inch wheels led headlights , navigation with real time traffic overlays , rain sensing windshield wipers , adaptive cruise control and a head up display .Most options . Air of the cosmetic variety consist of blue seat belt straps , perforated leather and exclusive into your colors like spice grey dot Burgio brown and ivory . White .High rollers can also order a set of custom crafted Louis Vuitton luggage for the totally reasonable price of just $26,000 .You can't make this stuff up wave to the people .Of course , this price point offers no shortage of alternatives . Those looking for a bar room numbers generator will likely gravitate towards the Audi R8 Mercedes-Benz SL 63 AMG . While affluent types in need of a green machine with a usable backseat might express a preference for the Porsche Panamera s E hybrid . You can also take home an all electric Tesla model s and a Cadillac hell are plug in hybrid for about the same prices in I A8 as to meet vehicles combined into one . The I A8 clearly isn't for everyone , but it does go to show that environmentally friendly vehicles won't spell the end of performance cars . So if this is what the future has in store for us , sign me up"

23,40,X5,"This is the new BMW X5 , and it's a bit like BMW's own headquarters in Munich , Germany , because you wouldn't describe it as being pretty . But it certainly stands out , in fact , under quick impression of this car . So look at the huge grill , so on it of its flow , its nostrils , this particular car but here has very spit to murder . The side looks like I've been off roading . Haven't that's just designing ? Would that BMW will fit to this car as an option that's alive just completely made up , right ?So this car , it's not the cheapest , but then it is a luxury SUV , so it starts from 57 a half �1000 but you can save an average of 1500 quid on one through car , while in fact , if you look on the pop out back in the top ranks of the screen , Q7 Q7 a new car .I thought I'd start this review at the boot to let you see the rear end of this car , which once again isn't the most beautiful V8 to Sendai . And this is another standout feature . BMW has kept the X5 split tailgate . I really like it it's handy if you just want to perch on here or push things in . Another thing I really like is this . Look , this is one of the disadvantages A7 split tailgate . You wanna reach in , you need to put it back up . But I like this look . The parcel showed impressive put in there and just slides out so so very easily on most of the cars . It's a fast BMW really solved the problems of its . Put that down again . I'm sure you mean easily Slide in this out of the booth . How do we go ? Look at that . There's plenty of other useful features in here , So we've got various tie down places there underneath here , and that's that . Look on a gas truck stays up . That feels posh . What would know their spare wheel in there ? But this car's on run flat tire . So you just got space which in store stuff in on . Let's return to this parcel shelf because , hey , you look at this . It will fit under here . It's that way . I'm trying to figure out how to do I know you can do it . I can see signs here . Spare with me .What you've learned that there was gonna be very easy the next time space into there . There's also little hooks toe hanging things off but shopping rolling around when you go around corners . It's a nice square shape . The actual capacities about 15% less , and you get an Audi Q7 but still looking . There's easily enough on dhe . Look , I can fall down the rear seats from here and then just flop perfectly into place . And it's almost completely flat floor just raised towards the end . But you can pushing straight to the front . I want to see this as well . When I shoot the tailgate , we'll do the problem . Park , I forgot to tell you something . Look at this . I will say this . So if I press this button here , I have an electric tow hitch on Dhe because I've got a suspension on this car . I can actually look . There's another button here . If I press pushes down , then I press this . It should lower the card . It says suspension , lowering . Dance with my electric tow hitch , which obviously natural extra . But this lettering feature is standard because his car comes with a suspension as standard . There you go brilliant elephant in the room to get Let's get to the back seats .I'll just leave this stuff out of the way to Mark A5 recovered . He lets up . Put the seat back . It's simple . We don't release the catch . I get into this car's dead . He's got massive doors that the wheel arches an intruder tall . The high is just right for just flopping into our great , very easy to get into . You got easy access , either . Fix anchor points down here under flip . It covers so you won't lose the covers . What you do with the popoff ones ? Also the senator and back . It's dead . Easy to maneuver a big , bulky child safe . They can see . Look , this season , my usual driving position . I've got loads and loads of room , plenty of head room , even though we've got the panoramic glass freeze here that's really bright now . It's actually good that when it's dark , you little lights there , so it does give you decent reading light . That's not the case in most cars , anyway , back to who I was talking about , so lots of knee room very , very comfy . Now it doesn't feel quite a space in the back as an anti Q7 in part . The reason for that is that you can't slide nor recline the seats , but they are super comfy . There's lots of support under your legs there fairly reclined anyway . Yeah , if you wanna carry three , it's not by the tour . The floor's almost completely flat to this plenty of foot space . The Middle C is slightly firmer , so it's not as comfortable . But you can fit three adults in the back here . In fact , when you check out a detailed practicality video , you can see just what it's like with red dots in the back . So much stuff you can find the boot and how easy it is to fit a child . See speak of children . There'll be more than happy back here , so the wood ledge is quite low . Also . Look , A3 windows go all the way down , which is very unusual these days , so that's good . Now , under here , you have obviously your arm rest , but you could be there .If you want to use that on , you got your cup holders there . Other storage well down here , you've got the area . There were mobile phone . There's your 12 volt socket . You can charge them devices their climate control down here . And you got event here to blow towards you . Keep you nice and warm . Also down here , you've got a plan Style folders on the backs of the chairs . Really solid , Phil . Expensive . Good place your iPad . You can actually get special Man's , which attacked into the seat back there . And you can bet your iPod and then charge here off us . Bc plugs That's very modern . And it today And finally the rear door bins Look , they are absolutely massive . Player room for my flat dog is in the front . Even bigger as I'll show . You know , think of space in this car is actually very , very good . Look at this . These top into massive over the storage . In here , you have to cup holders . There they are just about big enough for a decent size ball on . This is a great thing on this car . I can either choose to cool my drink or I can heat it . Keep my coffee nice and warm under here . You got into the USB charging point there and you've got Wallace charging few mobile phone . He's put it there and let it charge up , covered when you're not using it , more storage under here . It's actually quite a decent space , and there's another U S B . C . Input there as well . A box of junk fits on average size and last , but storage is down here . Look story general .There you can keep the money or whatever you want to tell you the design . You have a quick look at it . Personally , I think this is much better . Any previous X5 . It's a big step on the designs . Really , really nice . Also like the way that the event pattern is actually mimicked here in the interior light pattern . That's quite cool . One part I'm not so sure about is this . Here the dash sort of freaks my eyes out a bit , but generally I think it's a really nice looking car , like the way that they have , like , compartmentalize stuffs , only driving controls just here in this single part .Then you've got your stereo controls just here and there , like took sensitive as well .Then you have , like your climate control stuff on here , all very easy to use , and there's a quality so everything you touch soft , it's their soft , soft it away down here on its dead solid as well . The quality in here , I think , is better than any other SUV at this price . It's absolutely gorgeous .You also get electric operation of the steering wheel . There's loads of adjustment , the seats as well . I like the fact that I can extend the front part of the seeds on . Look at this . I can move the back part electrically as well . This car hasn't graded leather �2000 extra , but it's super soft .Another Reddit has is something called glass elements for the interior S550 pounds . It includes glass bits for the star butter switch with the stereo and , most notably , on , most horribly , the gear selector . It just looks a little bit tacky , if you ask me , Marcon complain about , though , is the screens that you get in this car .Let's first of all talk about the driver's display . It's a standard on the X5 on . You can do different things like See the satnav , innit ? Go through various items . Anything I don't really like right ? So much is that the Rev . Counter runs backwards , like on a Persian , which is a bit odd , but it doesn't mean they can free up in the space in between the dollars to fit the SAT nav map there at all times . If you want it the main entertainment screen . It's really good , really clear . The image on it is , though . Someone's actually painted it on . The graphics are that sharp , and you can operate in lots of different ways . He can use a swivel wheel like that . You can use things like gesture control . So that is to do the volume that is to change track . There we go to registering it here , but actually those gestures a bit of a gimmick . The metal . Just use the buttons on the steering wheel on the swivel world . Or , of course , the touch screen if you want to . But the latest in for this new entertainment system is intuitive voice commands . He can just talked it normally . Just have to wake it up by gay Hey , BMW , take me to car . Why , it's actually taking me to Carlisle . You just lose some points there . BMW afraid Well , so doesn't cope too well with middle index , but I kind of get the idea , the actual entertainment system itself if you just use it normally like , would I drive very easy to use . You can just spin through the menu's just on the left hand side . The satnav looks really good and generates okay , there . Anything like found with a certain of is that it's not the smartest . Sometimes it just wants to stick you on the main route . Even there , like back routes , will be quicker . Yeah , it's no up to the standard of ways or Google maps , I think , from reading , but it's really quite good . Say it looks really , really nice . For more information on this card entertainment system , click on the pop out bandaged up there , the top right corner screen for more detail on this car's interior on all the tech .Now let's talk about some equipment , so generally it's pretty good on this car . You get 19 inch Allah wills . You get leather interior , get the air suspension was talking about . You get climate control , step up to the M sport , which is what this car is , and whatever have pretty much . Then you get a sporting body kicking 20 inch Allah wheels upgraded , breaks more spoiled .It's on the inside , such as this sport steering wheel .Now it's definitely worth going onto car wear and checking out our configuration , like building one of these cars or any car for that matter . Have a play around with it and see what kind of offers you can get back on the building next five or any card you're choosing , for that matter now , then it's time for the car y A5 annoying things about this car , along with many other X3 V's .The doors look that I cover the cells and they get all dirty . So when you get out in that room in the back seat , trousers on the cell , as you can see , it's happened here . That's why this bit it'll clean now . Well , over the back of my truck you have the top of the range Bowers and Wilkins stereo .You get this beautiful metallic central speaking over here on the dash . This car has the less expensive Harman Kardon system and saved this plasticky nasty cover . You kind of remind you that you don't quite earn enough .You can get a digital key for your mobile phone so you can open it without actually having to use the key Anything . Is it only works with an android phone . Yet this car isn't available at all with Android Auto only apple carplay . So you need an apple phone with stereo , an android phone stopped at the doors . That's a logical captain . This is supposed to be a luxury car , but you don't get luxury items .Such a lumbar support , which helps prevent back A8 on long journeys a standard for it . You know what ? I'm not paying for it . I'm gonna use this instead . And up .Yes , save some money If you want .You could bake for a digital key , which allows you to do things remotely on the cards that operate the windows . The climate control . Look at the display . It's just so slow to respond . It's flooding the very first touch screen mobile .Thankfully , these cars plaintive call features to help make up for all this S5 .There's a little light on the steering well , which change color to give you some information about the driving ideal using So when the green it means it's good to go where they go from orange to red .To give you a warning with the Saran View cameras , you get a bird's eye view of the car , which helped you out when you're parking or going through tight spaces . Also , watch this . This will flip to a view above , seeking just how close you can get to an obstacle .The thing just I just want this out . Going to three D view I can actually see like the graphical image of the car . Then I should be able to just look round it using gesture controls . There we go playing a computer game .The optional laser lights can beam up to 60 meters down the road and up to 10 times by the North .Led is you have to worry that uncle in traffic because they could black out part of their beam so they don't dazzle of the drivers with optional reversing assistant , the car is constantly remembering your steering input as you drive along the slow speeds . Let's say you're in a busy parking garages . Do not . Manu was weaving in and out like that . The car will remember your inputs for the last 50 meters , so they say , come to a dead end or your face points on community of the way , and you need to reverse anything I'll go to all those steering and put together , but in reverse mess in my head . All that worry . You put the car into reverse , you hit the steering assistant button . The car will then play your stereo input backwards . So you basically go through all the obstacles . You've just driven through a piece . A cake .Look about if you get the penalty glass roof has 15,000 individual led V90 elements in it . So when you change the ambient lighting of the cabin reef changes . Well , Look it , orange blue there , Let's put it , greed . Finally pull for being in a brothel . How much ?So now we've looked around the car . Let's see what it's like to drive this X5 might be a big car , but it's not too difficult to drive in town . You get a good view out because you set quite high . In fact , you feel like you're sitting on this car rather than in it . Like you do more so than Audi Q7 . You don't feel quite as high as if intimate like a Landrover discovery , though , so it's still no good .Looking down on people or invisibility is all right there . The back window isn't that big , but there's not much of a blind spot by the rib . Hello , that's a good thing .The gearbox eight speed automatic eats blooming lovely . You can be in just normal cruising about you floor it , and it does respond quickly and pick up . It's not fast . Engine this . This is the real litre straight six . Diesel engine . Plenty of performance . Absolutely great . And the other engines you can get with this car really a petrol engine . But that's quite Thursday . There's a Maur powerful three litre diesel with four turbos . That's really quick , but it's also really expensive . This is the sweet spot in the range , right ? Price right economy . Speaking of economy , I'm getting in 29 miles per gallon . It's not that great . You can get back out of it . It's just that I've been rushing it a bit .All models come as standard with air suspension on air Suspension is lovely , lets you float over the bumps . It's really good now .Speed up , which is very easy to do with his diesel engine or 2 66 and 1/2 seconds on the motorway .It's very quiet . You don't get hardly any wind noise at all what you're really here are the tires on ? That could be the run flats . They do make a bit more noise than normal tires on the motorway .It sure footed planted easy car to do long distances in the press of a button . I can put into into sports mode , though . So obviously sports model slightly stiffer suspension increase throttle response . Weighted steering actually be fun on a CV . The ace fun It feels like a BMW should to drive .

24,42,6 Series,"This is the new BMW six Series GT , and it's a bit like a smoothie in the way that it's a blend of various BMW ingredients . S8 supposed to combine the practicality and load looking capacity has been like a fight serious touring the rear passenger space and luxury of a seven serious salute on a slightly raised right height . For good view out that you get with some liken X5 now , obviously , it supposedly filled with great ingredients . But why is it the being healthy has to taste so blooming horrible hatefully ?This is a better job on isn't quite so horrible , so it starts from �48,000 . But through Carl , you claim an average of �6000 on . Now .If you click on the pop out but in the top right hand corner of the screen on the label of the video , you gotta call why dot com to see how much you can save on a new car here in the front there , six GT-R is pretty identical to the five Siris on which it is based , But that's not a bad thing , because quality strong in this car really nice materials fills solidly built . If I'm brutal , it lacks arbiter persons , and it's a bit dull into a design , though it's easy to use now .Stan , did you get this wide screen satnav system , which is a touch screen ? You can use it by the swivel , which is easy to do while you're driving , and it's very intuitive . A really good entertainment system , one of the very best . Also get digital dolls will say digital dollars that part digital . The main $2 are , however , the functionality isn't as good as the digital dolls you get onto another Audi A7 or the Mercedes C . L s . Now for more data on this car's entertainment system , clicking the pop up out of the top right hand corner , the screen on the link below the video from my full in debt video review of it in terms of other things , well equipped levels are very good , like I say .So you get things like cruise control .You get 18 inch alloy wheels , you get a rear parking come in . It's really high definition as well , so that's all good . This one is the M sport , so it's got some extra bits and pieces , such as a panoramic glass and reef . A4 .May you also get sports seats .You get a sporty body kit .You're so get 19 inch other worlds .And as you can see , not only can you open the blind here , you can open the glass roof itself to let a little bit of air .And obviously this all bumps at the cost this particular car got here , which is the ex drive 30 ice has got four wheel drive . It costs in the city's war trim from �58,000 . Now , I played the details of this car into car . Wow . I got an offer back for �52,000 .What is it now ? One thing I need to point out to you Is this space here in the front ? So this is a good car because you're raised up and it's quite love . Headroom in the front . You can actually jack up the sequel Long way to get a good view over the traffic . It's really good if you're on the small side because you can get pretty high without your head touching . Yet if you're tall , you could get low enough that yeah , you're gonna be able to fit in here and be very , very comfortable . There's another practical features .There's some storage under here . The glove box it's rolling on . Look at this . The door bins they can hold my big smoothie container . That is very impressive .What's more impressive though , his space in the back seats . So this six GT-R is way better for passengers . S7 liken Audi A7 and way , way better the new Mercedes C . L s . Look , this loads of headroom You lived in loads of knee room . I can stretch out as far as I want to hear . Actually , I can also make the seat backs more upright . But why do that when you can recline them ? Plastic S8 got soft pillow here on this particular car , which is really lovely .Then here we've got some Audi Audi operate them . I wonder their area another Come on . Well , that does that . Which I was rubbish at the Rubik's Cube . Can't even operate cupholders . You got that there . And also look some through loading if you want to carry some longer items and still to backseat passengers and actually you can carry three people in the back of here .Okay , ish . Now this middle C is a bit of a parchment . Still , I've got enough headroom in the foot wells , a huge so you can carry through the back at once if you want to look , I got rear .Entertainment system here is well on Dhe , the other's head friends for us on some big door pockets . I won't look privacy blind hit the Senate as well as prying eyes . Now let's look at the other practical feet .Just the boot of this car , which is very big once again because Audi A7 on Mercedes-Benz S is obviously it's a hatchback , so it's very easy to load , I sense into this huge boot . As you can see , there's no load left . There's a scuff plates . Pull stuff straight out like this features well , this local , but I can easily remove it . And it fits underneath this false floor , which is held up by gas struts that is super posh , by the way , Look need at the way other useful feature got here is a 12 volt socket . There's some hooks there , tied down points as well , but my favorite . But is this to lower the rear seats ? I just press a button press the other one as well as you can see the light , completely flattened . Nice , flat load area . This is a very practical car for more detail on that thing in the Popeye , around in the top , right hand on the screen , a little below the video . See my detail . Practicality with you . You've got to see just how much stuff you can . Criminals , Car's boot .What's that with three adults in the back seat ? And how easy is individuality now ?Then it's time for the car .Wow , A5 Annoying things about this car I'm raising BMW has it's all pointless little cubby space here . It's too thin and narrow to be of any use at all .Yeah , it's really not comfortable for me here .The front door's open same plumbing wide , which I think is a good thing until you want to shut them again , and it's a really reach to get them .It's been a silver trim on the steering wheel . Seems to just reflect too much like that . It's just Dad was a bit while driving . I think I'm gonna have to come up with something less bright .These speakers for the Harman Kardon stereo just looks so flimsy does there , you can remove them .Come off . It won't bill to get back on what you can get . A BMW six years GT-R apple carplay . It doesn't have an android or toe , so I can't connect my phone . Use its operating system . So don't worry .There's still places like about this car .Here's the car Wow Cool features another where the owners humble is included in the entertainment system , and you even have little videos . Show you work .Adapt your vehicle's headlights . That's enough of that . It doesn't mean that you don't have to check on YouTube if you want to know how to work . The girl .This new six years GT-R about 115 kilos lighter than the old five GT-R , which it replaces . That's what I'm waiting to perspective for you .It's about the same as not one but two call why producers So while actually , if you have the car adaptive mode , the satellite navigation talks the automatic gearbox , and it tells it to automatically downshift because you're approaching reduction to help slow the car . Also , the stops . Our system is quite clever . They won't just cut the engine if you pause briefly to give way sign .And with many new cars these days , there is no styling faker in hell . There's exhaust pipes . They are really . Also , there's these vents just here at the front of the car , which is supposed to hit the air flow of the wheel and act down the side . But are they Ariel Z8 ? Well , yes , they are . Then do six years GT-R axes the car . Stick of truth twice . I love the optional surrounding cameras taken . Have a good look all around the car . Is that right ? So when I get the other side , you will see you . See you there . Wait there . Let's do it again . That is what produces sound just chilling out . Now , watch this . If I put it into automatic mode and then drive forward the view Well , look forward on then to change when I get close so I can really get nice and snug into a parking space . Yeah , it's everything . Brilliant .They're six years GT-R Kes . Like it's gonna be a company car on dhe .Indeed it is on why I like about it , is that it's comfortable even in standard frame . So yeah , I think goes over bumps better than the standard trimmed Audi A7 Mercedes-Benz less you cannot great all round air suspension on that improves it even further then it isn't quite so comfortable in their suspension as the Audi A7 years on . It's so anyway , probably worth to think . BMW always have this reputation for being supported . To drive . This one doesn't live up to the reputation because it's it's quite all on its own heavy car as well . So when you throw it into Cory doesn't mean quite a lot . And you also know that much of an idea what the front wheels are doing in terms of grip because of steering . It's almost like playing a computer game . It's a bit remote , but really , do you care ? It's gonna call . You want to feel remote ?The only problem is , is that you don't feel so remote from the road because you could hear the road as the ties rollover , speedy , get quiet , roaring sound of the cabin , and there's a bit of wind noise from these big pillars .Speaking of which , there are blind spots mean when you're in town , you're gonna be looking around that to make sure that there's no one in there that you're gonna knock over crossing . If you look at the back window , you ain't gonna see much because it's about as big as a letterbox , which is no great .What is great , though , is the automatic gearbox . It's got eight speed . It's smooth , it's fast . And of course , he can change kids yourself using the pedals , which I tend to like to do that .Why , actually your economy ? Speaking of which the engine that I've got in this car is the 40 eyes it has threatened . Boy horsepower . It's quick , it's smooth . It sounds good on dhe . I'm getting 27 mpg , which is all right for a petrol engine . Considering the performance , you could get a live performance version of this straight six turbo charge special anti , which will give you a better economy . But I say don't bother without go with a diesel . Yes or no . Diesel is on in the moment , baby . Lots of miles , which a light , if you have a collar , is diesel will be the most efficient on dhe . It's a really strong put change in the three that diesel . Now you can get his car with all wheel drive to this 6 40 I has it a standard . You get the diesel with reward driver place . Make sure to get the four wheel drive version on the 30 I . The least powerful petrol that's only available is real drive . So you pay your money .

25,43,i5,"estate cars . They're not particularly exciting right there just for people who need a load of space , and that's about it . But what if you need a car that has plenty of space ? Is hugely practical . It's also very comfortable , luxurious . Looks good on DDE is designed to be fun to drive as well . Core could give you all that probably a car . You can also maneuver by remote control , a car such as the new BMW A5 . Siri's touring it promises cutting edge technology loads of space on exemplary Dr Oppressive luxury . But does it deliver ?This particular car is in esports room , so you've got the bigger front grille there , and it's got the air curtains . That air goes in there because of the side of the wheels and escapes through this breather here , and it helps smooth the airflow in it . I was just gonna be quite aerodynamic once again be in sport .You've got bigger wheels .It's also allowed by 10 millimeters and then the normal car . Torrance get the roof rails , make it look like a lifestyle vehicle . And of course , you've got the lift back tailgate and I think personally designed the touring just works slightly better than silly , but what do you think ? Click it there . Invite . Which one do you prefer ? The BMW A5 , Siri's Saloon or the touring for a big estate car that five years touring is quite a sleep looking thing That's like Tower Gate doesn't mean , though , that the low capacity isn't quite as much as you get with the boxer Mercedes-Benz Estate .But the 570 litres available is still 50 liters more than you get with a five series salute on dhe . The space is more useful to one of the great things about the five series . Touring is that you can just open the glass part , the tailgate , bagging quickly , then get out the rain . Been able to do that on every five Siri's touring since this started .The only problem is , is that I'm going to show you exactly the four features of this boot so you can open it hands free A3 once . Unlike some other systems , it actually works pretty much every time you want to use it . The low cover moves of out of the way automatically and there's a separate method dividers . Well , you could remove both of these and then fit them into the space into the force floor . The whole process is a bit of a fiddle . The receipt split three ways , and you can load them electrically from the boot to give a flat low bay with 1700 liters of space .But what about if you want to carry people the back seats in the fight , sir ? Salute our roomy enough , but the touring just seems a little bit more spacious now . Probably reason for that is the fact that you got the square of body . So got bit more headroom because you don't have the back in slapping them quite so much . The Saleen S5 headroom . But this one's even better . What's really nice is the extra glass you get so that square body means that you got square of rear windows , actually got larger rear windows and some extra rear windows there at the back . It just makes it nice and light back here . The panoramic sunroof does help is well .The car also gets BMW latest entertainment system on its a dream to use with you operators with the click wheel touchscreen or with voice commands . However , there's another import method band of these new I drive system has gesture controls say you can do things like turn up the volume of the stereo by just rotating your finger or do it the other way to turn it down on this particular car . I can change the radio station by going like that flick my two fingers at it . There we go . Sometimes you wanna flick it . The thing is that way one doesn't work , but that you get the point . One thing I do like is how you deal with telephone calls . So let's say someone calls you . There you go got Jack Scott and calling me . How handy is that ? If I want , I can dismiss the call just by going . No , thank you . I don't want to talk to you , Mr Jacks . Cotton . No , I really don't . It is quite nice . Dishes . Go , go away . I don't want to talk , but I wanted to answer it . I don't just lick my finger at it like that , but on the whole , I still find the gesture controls just a little bit tricky to use than the normal functions .There's another gadget , which the most people will also be a gimmick but to a few buyers , it could actually be the best optional extra ever .If you're worried about being up to squeeze your Big Five Series , touring into a narrow little garret and be able to get in and out of the car , don't worry . You can get it with BMW remote control parking on Deacon Drive the car forwards and backwards a little distance using the Elektronik kilo and so you can reverse out of your very tight parking space on , then hop into your car . Perfect .You can get the car with another parking gadget , but this one will be useful to most people they get . It's called with an amazing surround view camera system , so if I don't bring up the camera , I can then put it into park camera mode on . I couldn't change the view two different angles . But this is the best bit looking at this whole three defended image like a computer game , and you can actually use the gesture control to then rotated around the car . Look at this . There we go now , honestly , this because this is quite interesting . It even knows when I opened the front door and it should open the front door on the graphic we'll date for the Rays as well . I'm just wondering if you would do for the boot . Let's find out . History is . Will it do the boot as well ?Has it done it ? Is it done it ? No money makes it in for the front and rear doors . That's the next step for the designers . They need to upgrade it so that you can actually see the boot open as well on the graphic . But still , that's really coal .Technology doesn't end there , though . There some to take the strain out of long motorway journeys such as the steering and lane controlled assistant . So one of the things it can do is read the lines in the road , and it will actively steer the car to keep it within the lines . Now you're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel , and if you take , the market will probably give you about 10 15 seconds of driving that you hands on the wheel before it will warn you , and then it will shut down the system . But I've noticed that if you just rest of me on the steering wheel , it pretty much thinks your hands on it . I will just continue working . So I'm just driving along on the autobahn , cruising at 100 kilometers an hour . The car's doing everything for me . It's steering . I've got the active cruise control on , so it's keeping my speed , and it's using radar to measure to the car in front . So now the conference is breaking . This car is breaking automatically . It also reads a speed signs on I Got My Cruise Control set 100 read that sign , and then it suggests that I might want to change my setting on the cruise control and at the touch of a button , I can reset my top speed again as that new speed limit . So it's all that easy . You can just sit back , relax and the car do everything for you . Yeah , Andi , stay within the law . Maybe I should drive a lot just to be a responsible person . But what about if you want to do the driving yourself ?One of the things about estate cars is that because you've got more body work for Santa pants around , they can be a little bit noises in the saloons on which they based but I can't really tell much difference between this and the silly version of the five series . It's such a quiet car , anyway . It's all in the road or wind noise . Everybody hear the rain noise , but even then , that's not too bad .And it's a very complicated traveling . As standard , it gets a suspension . The back . It's self leveling . So if you put a big , heavy load in the boot , the noses and point skyward , neither in two dozen people at night when you get your lights on if you want , you can upgrade the car to have adaptive suspension . That's what this one's got . I've got in comfort mode at the moment on , it's slackened off the suspense , and it's all nice and soft , kind of floating , relaxing on its finding out what bombs I can find on the super smooth German roads . Very , very well press of a button I can put into sports mode , and it stiffens things up , and it just makes the coffin the bit sharper corners flatter .On this particular fighters , touring is about 100 kilos lighter than the old one on .As a result , maybe a bit more our job that said It's still a big car , goes on corners well , but wouldn't describe it as being sport engine choices . In the five series , touring included two litre Diesel M5 20 day , which will do acclaimed 62 miles per gallon three litre petrels in the 5 30 i a wheel drive 5 40 x tries . But for those that one performance on economy , there's the diesel I'm driving . This particular car is the 5 30 D on it's got beautiful three litre engine in it . It's absolutely lovely , so it's got till 165 horsepower will get nor to 60 in just 5.8 seconds on the most impressive thing about it is the pulling power . So it's got 620 new means of torture . You put your foot down and just it's just motors this thing on it sounds really good . Anything is . The BMW is playing some engine sound with speakers . So the noise you hear isn't the noise that people on the outside here they hear a diesel rattle . You hear a kind of like almost like a V8 from its been old , regardless of which vices touring you go for they all come as standard with an eight speed automatic gearbox because it paddle shifters if you were to change , gear yourself or if you wanted to be supportive . But you can't be bothered to change gears you put into sports mode , and then yet it did not respond . Put your foot down . It's on it straight away , changing gears when you need it to its very fast , yet also very smooth .Perhaps for me , the most impressive thing about this fire series touring is how the weather is absolutely dreadful . When I'm filming on the inside of the car . When I get to film the shots of the outside , it's blooming lovely , brilliant .Other than that dental G5 , Siri's touring starts from around �38,000 which makes it about �2000 more than the equivalent Saloon .

26,47,i3,"welcome to another episode of fully charged this time coming from the interior off the exquisite electric vehicle that is the BMW A3 .Now , this really is a kind of follow on to the episode we did about the new reign is over in the 41 kilowatt hour .No , Zoe , the original BMW A3 came out with a 60 hour battery . How easy is that to understand , which was 22 kilowatt hours on This is the new BMW A3 , which has a 94 and power battery , which is 33 kilowatt hours . Just to make things really conflicted , confusing . I was very confused about it , but I now understand . So it was gone from 22 killer our battery to a 33 killer . Our battery in the same housing exactly the same as those . Oh , so this is a higher density battery in the same pack . And apparently it's the same weight , which is quite interesting because they know the Zoe was slightly heavier on what that does that means is , in the real world , as people who've driven I three's no , the real world range of the original Zoe was around the sort of 80 to 90 75 80 that kind of range where when it said it was 120 This one is clearly around 120 when they say it's probably 100 4450 . But you would clearly get a genuine riel a ll the year round . It's the middle of winter now 100 20 miles out of this car , which is fantastic , absolutely brilliant change .But here's the difference that I know is a fact . BMW have stated very publicly that they're happy to carry out a retrofit on original BMW .I three's with the 22 killers are battery . You can trade that battery in on . They'll fit this new battery pack in , which gives you a very substantial increased mileage . And they will use those old battery packs as static storage systems , which proves , according Thio BMW their commitment to sustainable and clean technology .Here we go , so there's a bit of a spiel from BMW , but that is very good . So they're going to use the battery packs from the old cars . Thio do a static energy stories . You want key areas that that's being going to be used in . I see that's happening . It's what's happening with the old Reynolds . Oh , batteries is for electric car charging that all electric car like large scale ones .I'm talking . Rapid charges on motorways will have battery packs attached to them , which will be constantly charging from the mains , which will give them the charges . The ability to deliver a great deal , more power in a short period . I've got this car for a few hours today . What was annoying was it wasn't full when we got it , so I've got no idea . You know , I'm not doing a kind of realistic test , but it's very obvious that , you know , when it's half full less than half full , it's saying 60 miles . So it's giving an estimate of about 122 125 miles on a charge , as a lot of regular viewers will know and people who've got these cars . Now you can get this car with a range extended option of 250 cc effectively motorbike engine that is in the back of the car that runs our generator , which can maintain your charge level as you drive along or can extend the overall range . So the overall range of this car would be with them with the range extent , it would be a realistic 160 170 miles of normal driving any time of the year . But you gotta put petrol in very small petrol tanks about four and 1/2 liters , so it's not gonna take you that far , but you can maintain the charge on just keep keep it going . So if you like now , if I was to put on the range extender , it would keep the battery level at this level , which is about 55% . As long as you had petrol , you just put more petrol in .That keep going isn't an in depth review of the I threes . I've already driven it quite quite a lot , but I have to say , soon as I get back in one , I go . This is a really nice car . This really is one of the best electric cars that are on the road , going past a lot of Army trucks . I don't think they're hybrids are sure I really do love the the Eye . Three is I think it's the best electric car of its size , and it's the best one to drive .There we go . Look , look at that one . Burnt them off . They barely started , and we're already nearly there . Fantastic .That is really encouraging that these cars are being upgraded , that the manufacturers are sticking with them and selling them either . I mean , one area I know in the U . K . Where you see these , where there's a cluster of A3 is an area in London called Notting Hill . It's where our ex Prime minister , David Cameron , has got gaff houses round there . They're very reasonable four bedroom , terraced Georgian house , 7 to �10 million . So , you know , if you're thinking of moving to London , I look in the area very nice , but that the streets of area used to be chock a block bursting with massive BMW Volvo Range Rover SUV . Huge great cars now is bursting with BMW A3 .They really caught on with the Notting Hill set is such a joy to drive a proper electric car , you know , because I've been trying out quite a few different hybrids and plug in hybrid thing that that when you drive a proper electrical like this , it's just really nice . It works really well . The region just check the region .That's good .There's just set up really well . It's really easy to drive if you get the chance to do a test drive of a night . Three do take it . Most of the BMW dealerships are quite good with their high range . They have eye specialists , and if you book a test drive , think you'll really enjoy driving . These cars are very , very nice .So I'm going to do now is try and increase my overall electric range while I've got the car . So I'm gonna plug it in in a public car park charging facility . It's marked on the on the map .I just like using public charges , you know ? Don't take me for beautiful look at that way .Did was we drove to a public charger plugged in only 13 amps . A3 killer . What's so No , it didn't add my I did Well , we had a quick bite to eat for lunch . Added 10 miles of pure range . S o Okay , So it was just just to see just cause I knew that charge was there .That's why on then on , and then I had to think about it . We had a talk about it over lunch and I was going , or if in the world where I had a bottomless pit of money , which would I buy the hund I ionic or the BMW I three with the bigger battery ?And I I love driving this car . This is the nicest car to drive that I've ever bean .But I think I'd have the Ionic just cause it's got that extra range , you know , it does do 150 to 200 miles on the charge . No , 100 to 120 on That does make a big difference .Because I really love that .I've forgotten about how much I love their ionic . Basically , I think the important thing to take away from this is don't listen to my opinions about which car If you're gonna buy an electric car , have a girl in all of them if you can . Because I just heard from someone who went thio Hyundai Sales Place and couldn't they wouldn't They didn't have the pure electric , and they didn't want them to drive it . So they had to go in the hybrid . One liked it so much they bought on electric one from a dealership that 150 miles away went and got it on . Drove home in it without any trouble on one charge . So there you go . You've got to be determined if you wanna have a go in electric car cause the dealerships aren't always on your side , which doesn't really make very much commercial sense .But there we go . The rear seats . Okay . My cousin has one of these cars , and there were doors that open , backwards way described in the previous review of the eye . Three .My auntie is 97 years old . She's absolutely extraordinary woman . She's 97 . She was in the back . My cousin wouldn't let her go in the front . She was in the back . He brought her over on Boxing Day and she was just fabulous . And she was reminiscing about the time that a bomb fell outside her house during the war and didn't explode . Because if you had , I wouldn't be here . Nor would my mom , Norwood . Aunty Peggy . So that was a very interesting conversation . They all came back to her in immense detail from 70 years ago . Amazing . Yeah .So the eye three Maria cousin loves it and all the people I've ever met them that drive I three absolutely adore them really brilliant cars .And this is such a brilliant step forward to make them have a bigger battery . There's no bigger one last point . I really should make this . Which is the the upgrade that you can take out your 22 killer our battery , and put in the 33 killer our battery in the same car . It's perfectly technically feasible . Um , I've heard through reading blog's and things not from anyone who seems to actually know that this service is not currently available in the UK or the U . S . A . Which puts a bit of a crimp on that piece of news . Yes , you can upgrade your battery and put in a new battery . Have your old battery used again to back up the grid , Not here or in America s Oh , I don't know if that's true . If you do know , please comment , and I will correct that piece of information in an upcoming news episode .Anyway , that's all for now , because this is just a very quick episode . Please do subscribe to fully charged if you haven't already have a look merely a look . The patriarch link at the bottom of the night beneath this video on DDE , as always with all these shows , because I really appreciate the fact that you watch them if you have been thank you for watching ."
27,48,i3,"hello . Welcome to another episode of fully charged . This episode is all about the BMW I . Three . Now I have done a show about this before , and that's when I got to drive on when it was launched , but only drove it for about an hour . And you never really can tell really what it's like when you do that . So it's great that I've got this for much longer .Now I've got 54 miles of charge . It's not full . It's about half empty on .But I'm going to drive it now and see what happens . And I've waited out . So I've got my foot on the brake . It's on and I push this lever here , and then that puts it in gear and then it starts to move . It's that easy . Handling is just exquisite . It's really , really nice car to drive it . It goes where you stare all those things . It's not wiggly wobbly . This is a really tight little cars . Fantastic , very nice car to drive , very comfortable , brilliant visibility , mirrors and everything .All that stuff . Excellent . It's nippy out of my and now 50 mile an hour limit . So I'm doing 36 . And if I just go like that . It's very , very sort of solid push . Now this is an electric car with an electric photo with a big battery that you charge . But this particular model there's two types of BMW I threw . This particular model has what's called a range extender , so it's the BMW A3 X1 engine in the back . What that does is extend the range of your batteries so you can set it toe . Hold the amount of charge you've got in your batteries . So , for instance , at the moment I've got 54 miles in them in the battery .And if I then apply for to put the range extending thing on which I've took me a while to learn how to do that no forever , because I'm going to say now the standard BMW into face is not my favorite thing . I put the range extender on on I click hold state of charge . So there we go .It's a really it's a tiny engine . That's what's amazing is a little motorbike engine , and what that does is runoff . Petrol runs a generator , and it maintains the level of charge that you've got in the batteries . It doesn't let the battery go down below that what this can mean is many things . One of the things that comedians say you're driving quite a long distance on . You're going to a city where you can't use a petrol engine , which is going to be something that's being introduced into most European cities in the next few years . Then you drive with that running so that the battery maintains its level of charge . And then you've got , you know , 70 miles of electric range when you're in a city anyway , so that a CZ you can tell .I mean , I've driven this car very little , and it's just absolutely automatic . It works really , really well . It's a very nice car to drive it . It keeps up with traffic without any effort . All can easily break the speed limit . And if you want to do that , it's got cruise control .It is literally that . There we go . It's on cruise control .It very easy to use . No one showed me that I worked that out myself . It's got lots of different audio inputs . It's got Bluetooth . It's got USB input , play stuff on your phone , all that stuff . It's got all that stuff . The thing that I would be critical over , I think is that's because I'm spoiled . So I'm used to the Tesla's navigation system and all that stuff on this really does have , uh , what feels like quite an old school satin lavon . You know , input system . You know that you have to spell things out by moving in orbit of the island .So this car can also be charged in the same way as any electric car . You could charge it from a 13 M3 pin plug . It would take a long time . You can charge it from a seven A7 killer walk . So I'll put like I've got a home , which is search two amps , and you can charge it on a rapid charger on the motorway , which I will do in a bit just to have a go with it on their fairly now fairly common on motorways . Can motoring manufacturers agree on a standard charge it for the whole world waves , or where we can all use the same one ? Of course they can't like mobile phone cos they were gonna have their own special Dibley thing and eventually they work out . Oh , actually , it's better if we will use the same one . R8 . It takes 20 years , I reckon . In 20 years time , all electric cars will use the same wire . But at the same time , most electric cars will be charged using induction charging other than cables , cables .Isabel School Really here is one of the things I think is important , really . It's down to the two electric only Manufacturers B , Y . D and Tesla . They only make electric cars on dhe , the three big manufacturers that also produce electric cars . I think BMW is in that top three .So that's Nissan Renault on BMW because they make purpose built only electric . This car . There isn't a petrol version of this car . There isn't a diesel version of this car . This car was designed and built .Was an electric car that really makes a difference is not converted . It's no on adoption . You could argue that the Gulf e Gulf is the closest of any of the other cars where the manufacturer has gone from the ground up . Redesigned the whole body work so that it can be a diesel petrol plug in hybrid or pure electric , which the E golf is one of those cards , so you can argue that I have tried to argue that . But still it's kind of there's some compromises made . I think in terms of battery size , this car's just just built in so well . The battery on with Dr System and the battery management system is very sophisticated , very slick . They built a factory to make this car thing Amazing factory in Germany , which is I don't know how much power but enormously powered by renewable . So it's got a lot of solar , a lot of wind , and it's near a massive hydroelectric power plant , which is one of the reasons they did it . They built it there . So it thinks car . I think we'll have arguably , and I'm sure BMW would argue it . The lowest carbon footprint of any electric car produced , possibly of any car produced . I can't driving along the M four outside Bristol . On my right is a massive solar farm . I've just seen another one on the left back there and up on the hill is a wind turbine . I've got a sneaking suspicion that something is happening in the world .So driving this car today is really show me one very important thing , and that is that it's very hard to judge a car from a one hour test drive , which is all I've ever done in this car . When it was launched , I got to drive it around . Brands Hatch , motor racing Second breakneck speed . I got to drive it about for about an hour on the roads , and yet you could tell all the things that you need self . The brakes work , the indicators work you could do steering with it , you know , you know that . But I've driven it far enough now , over a couple of days to work out .How it'll plays together on this one is the BMW I three Rex with the range extended little petrol engine in the back that is almost impossible to hear when it's on . You just don't know when it's on or off unless you're going at four miles an hour and then you can hear it stops , and it's just a little like a motorbike engine that's turning a generator that's generating enough power to keep the batteries at whatever level there at when it turns on . And that , I think , is an interesting transition , like a transition drug if you like from people who are totally used to fossil fuel cars on , then want to try an electric one , but they get over . What happens if it runs out on a lane at night , which you get most Maur People run out of petrol than anyone knows . There's been a big flurry of activity around because there's all these signs on motorways that go check your fuel level because so many people are running out of fuel on motorways all the time . Do they have range anxiety They do when they stall in the fast lane ? That brilliant picture of that the other day someone just stopped in the fast lane cause pandemonium on the motorway because they run out of gas . How ridiculously stupid is that ? So this car allows you thio gently transition to understand how electric cars working .I've heard from so many people on Twitter . We've got these cars today that say they never use the Rex is someone I've spoke to , someone who's left me a message who's done 25,000 miles in their BMW A3 on . They've used nine litres of petrol in that time , so they very rarely use it , but it's there if you want it .And I've been driving today just to see what happens about the last 30 miles I've been driving with the little engine running on the battery level has maintained at 45 miles range . All that time doesn't go down . If you go fast on the motorway , it drops a little bit because their little motor can't keep up with the amount of electricity you're using . But normal driving speeds and normal B roads . A . Rhodes . It's absolutely fine , so you could drive literally . I could drive from him in Wiltshire . At the moment , I could drive to Scotland in this car without ever plugging in . Just keep putting petrol in it . It uses quite a lot of petrol . It took me a long time to work out how much petrol . So when I was driving this morning , the petrol was very nearly empty . So I stopped at a garage and I actually stopped and bought petrol with a petrol pump put in �8 . 61 filled it .That was an expensive petrol for gotten how expensive petrol is on a motorway service is , and how much cheaper is elsewhere . So it was . So let's say �8 S8 A8 pounds . That's easy , and that gives you about 80 miles range in the car for �8 . So then you work out that , that is , I did some calculations , so it should be really easy . 80 80 miles for �8 . That's like �10 initially went out . Cost �10 of mile . I went , God , this uses loads of petrol . No , that would be That would be if it goes A8 pats even do a mile . Okay , I waited that wrong . What I need is some help from a young person to explain how many miles to the gallon it does . He bought 7.24 liters off petrol for �8 . 61 p . 7.24 liters is 1.59 gallons , so a gallon costs �5 . 41 . If you can drive 80 miles on 1.59 gallons , you were getting 50.3 miles to the gallon . It's not that hard , rob it . I can do it and I'm so anyway . So you would be an idiot if you drove this car just using petrol .That's not what it's for uses electricity very efficiently . It's really the engineer . There's no question of that . I love the engineering BMW done on this , the electric motor , the way it drives it just really satisfying .It's a really nice car to drive .Brilliant visibility , quite bizarre doors .We learned something today that if you're in the driver's seat there and you've got someone who wants to get in the bag on the far side , they can close this door . But they can't close that one . Which means that the drivers to get out on going close it , but very , really , when would you ever have someone in the back unless there was someone in front ? So , you know , being a bit picky . But there are quite bizarre . Some people love them . Some people ate them . It's quite nice when it's like this . You could cool it down on a hot day very quickly . Another that it's just , you know , it does all the things that cars do , and it's It's brilliant .So I mean , it's definitely in my list of top five all time , Best electric cars , anyway . That's all that's all for this week's fully charged Thank you for watching you know the normal stuff . I'll just say it quickly . Subscribe , Patron , That's it . Thanks a lot .What you're watching here isn't some activist film about the impact of cars on the road on the impact of population . And how the fact that the world is really in trouble . No , that's not what this is . It's really intriguing . When I first saw the BMW A3 being launched , they showed this film . This film is an advert by a car company about how ridiculous it is , how many cars there are on the road and how we've all gonna change the way we use cars on . It's coming from a car company . I just thought it was intriguing , so I just wanted to show it just a bit of it at the end of this week's show . Anyway , that's all . Have a good look at it ."
28,49,330e,"alone . Welcome to another episode of fully charged Now , just before I start , I just want you to listen to this . Just listen or let me do it again , because that is a really good amazing sand . That's like there's no total . There's no cleaning is just just really good .So this is the BMW A3 30 e . It's a plug in hybrid BMW . I'm just going to start now . Haven't driven it yet .I have been told how to switch it on , and that's always a good start , and you can drive it in pure electric , which is what it set in now on . You can drive it in hybrid mode , and you can drive it in a safe for later motor that you only use the engine , but you save the battery for driving a Z8 discussed many times .Press unlock button to select a gear . Unlock the intel have done it for now we're moving . That's nice . I'm not doing anything . I haven't touched a pedal yet .I've spoken to a couple of people who have driven these cars who drive these guys you owe in these cars , and there they were so enthusiastic about them and they were slightly kind of petrol . Head G's is rather than them ICO warriors , I would say . But they really liked it .It didn't want me to do electric , only driving . It wanted me to use the petrol engine , which it suddenly did . So this is what a lot of proper blokes like these cars , these fairly small but BMW . But we're quite large engines because they've got a lot of Polk . They've got a lot of low in grunt . They've got a lot of month , all those sort of things . Now that is a very bad way of describing . That is , what I'm doing is adopting , for those of you outside the UK essentially a slightly working class British accent . When I do that , I'm gonna do it again . They've got a lot of grudge .They've got a lot of off because posh people like these cars , too , because they're quite expensive cars .So this one is the plug in hybrid .It's quite it's quite aggressive or the normal stuff .I don't even want it . I'm not going to say , but I'm gonna say it very quickly . Now I've just realised I got some paddles , so look at those in a moment .But you know all the normal stuff off the visibility , the ride comfort .I can already tell it a really solid carve it joined to the road . It's proper is a proper car for proper drivers who like doing proper driving rear wheel drive Z8 throw them back out . If you're on a disused runway , as we've seen many , many times on certain popular TV shows , I'm sure you could do all that with this . If you turn off traction control , you can do doughnuts and all those very important .But what I'm interested in , as regular viewers will be aware is whether actually makes any difference to its fuel consumption . The official fuel consumption figures for this vehicle are 134 miles to the gallon . How realistic is that ? I mean , it doesn't seem very realistic . A lot of people I spoke to use it to literally for their daily commute , but they don't use any petrol it all on . In fact , the petrol tank in this car is especially sealed petrol tank because petrol goes off if you don't use it . So they've had to redesigned the petrol tank to enable it to be have a tank full of petrol for a few weeks because you don't use any Petra . It all you're doing 10 15 mile commute and you've got so much a plug in it work like the guy who uses this car . He works at the BMW dealership . He said he uses zero petrol from Monday to Friday and he uses a bit at the weekends when he goes on long journeys is a lot of people criticize plug in hybrids and for very good reasons , and I think there's lots of reasons to criticize him .But I think that is a brilliant If there's 10,000 people who use zero petrol on , they drive to work in cars and they've got so much charge them at work . That's a big plus . If everybody did that way , would use staggeringly little petrol because one of the things it's important to point out and remember is in this country is very crowded . There's lots of cars As the roads are jammed , people sit in traffic jams a lot of the time . What do you do when you have it down with a petrol engine running , you're wasting stupendous amounts of petrol . It's just daft in these cars . You don't .I know Modern cars have got start stop technology , but that's really annoying . You don't notice this engine starting some things you could tell . When I first got in it , I couldn't tell whether the petrol engine was running off . Now I'm getting used to the controls at the moment is telling me I've done 99.9 miles to the gallon ? Well , that's fairly obvious because you haven't used any petrol to get along here is doing 10 9.5 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometers . So I've got 126 miles of range with petrol because the tank's about half full on 12 miles of range with electricity .So this car costs after the plug in car grant , which I believe is still around two and 1/2 �1000 . In the UK this car cost 34,200 something it's got five seats .I mean , where I am is incredibly comfortable . I'll say that now I'm sitting in the back . Yes , now I've been criticized and rightly so , that I very rarely show what the back of the cars like . So I'm showing you now . This is the back seat of the BMW A3 30 e and it's very , very comfortable . It's got good support . I feel very supported and comfortable . All the head rest isn't right . Now that is important . You must adjust your head rest . I've learned how to do that . You get that ? And you got that ? There we go all . Oh , nice . That's good . Yep . I've got good visibility . So it's nice . Yes . I like the back seat . The back seats ? Nice .They can do doors . BMW can do doors . That's a good door . Oh , hello .Or that is How can they make a door do that ? It's so much better than normal doors .It's a beautiful door .Still doing now , John ? I point my gun . So it's got an eight speed automatic gearbox A8 speed , which are controlled by these paddles on the steering wheel .I bet that's interesting . So , you know , uh , what it did is keep the engine in .This is the worst car of you . I was determined to do a proper car of you when I was a really confident car of you , and I've completely cocked it up , right ?So what ? I was just testing then , if you can use if you can shift down through these eight years , whether you get any regenerative braking effect and you do . But what it also does is it kicks the engine , so it's giving it its not really designed to do that . So it's not like the region paddles that you get on the hunt . Di Ionic , I suppose .One of the things that when I first started doing fully charged , I just driven the cars I had . I didn't really know much about it . I hadn't driven a lot of other vehicles . Now I've driven dozens . I can't even remember how many . So you do start to just by definition of experience , you do start to learn the differences between them , and you do appreciate them when a car is really well engineered and does what cars do when people really appreciate them and motoring journalists go on and on about how they drive so well on how they don't understeer well , they don't oversteer , and you start to get a feel for that because this car is just solid , it just doesn't wobble about .It just goes straight in the district A8 , and then it goes round corners on the guys . But I don't even know . I had to describe what it's doing , but I just know it's doing it really well .And I'm sure that is the same for the pure petrol version of this or the pure diesel version . I don't even know what BMW do with these cars . I'm sure there are A3 30 D's on 3 30 eyes , but our petrol and diesel I don't even know . I'm guessing that . I'll tell you why . I don't even know that I'm not interested because those cars are boring . And this car is just on the edge , just on the cusp of boring Andi . Quite interesting . So this car has 249 brake horsepower and can do 0 to 60 in 6.1 seconds , apparently . Okay , so I'm going to do I just put it in sport mode . I'm going to do it a naught to 60 cause you have to . It's really , really important how fast the car goes . You're not 16 straight road . Actually , there's nothing behind me are in front of me here . We g o 123 okay ? Yes , it's very swift . It Z8 years and I got up to three . Has a top speed of 140 miles an hour , which is really important . So that still hasn't quite are . It has affected my mpg , I was gonna say hadn't affected is taking a while to catch up is gone from 99.9 mpg to 22 . So I think that shows us that when you do that with a car , it uses a set quite a considerable amount of fuel .Wow , that delay is quite weird . And then it it does kick it really quickly . Look what I'm doing . That was involuntary . I'm laughing because I'm driving a car much too fast and being silly . So there we go . So that works . You get the BMW .Well , that's really interesting when you're used to electric car where your foot hasn't even got to the bottom of you going lam like that before it's it's off . This that you go One . What have you got this weird little delay ? Yeah , that's quite it's quite long today .So here's an interesting little thing . Okay , so the mpg monitor of it's on the dashboard goes up to 99.9 miles to the gallon . Well , if the vehicle has the genuine claimed range of 134 miles again , you never get a note . It'll just always say 99.9 . So why didn't they make it go up to 999.9 ? So you could see ? And it makes you wonder why , presumably they using standard BMW software that they're using all their cars , and they know that none of their petrol cars are going to do anything like that . So that's as far as they need to go . But it is very peculiar that if if you can do over 100 miles a gallon when you drive electric cars , as the man who drove this drives this car regularly said to me this morning , you get a bit nerdy about it . You do You want to see how far you could go , the minimal amount of fuel and you know the maximum range and all those things are very important . And this isn't telling you . This is just stuck at 99.9 , kind of pointless . I'm very , very conflicted about plug in hybrids . I think they're a big step up from hybrids A ll . Those are our steps , but they really like the first step . Like electric , pure electric is what we should be aiming at 100% . So these cars are always slightly compromised . They're more expensive , heavier because they're very , very complicated machines blend an electric motor in a petrol engine together , like they do in these vehicles , is really complex and requires a lot of engineering and a lot of extra weight . But , you know , I am averaging really around the mid fifties mpg in this car . I can now see over 30 40 miles . So I'm getting a vague idea of what this car can do .It's no , overwhelmingly brilliant , that's all for this episode , you know , have a look at the patriarch link below this video . If you want to absolutely no pressure to do anything of the sort . Please subscribe . A lot of you have , and I'm really appreciating . It's fantastic . The subscriptions growing every week on , uh , what else could I possibly say ? Well , I suppose if you have been , thank you for watching"
29,50,i8,"just accidentally knocked into sport . Intentional thing is the BMW A8 plug in hybrid supercar , and it really is a rather sit in a car .So those of us who saw the very last episode of Top Gear on the BBC that Jeremy Clarkson evidence may remember that he did review this car and he reviewed it very positively , absolutely loved it on one of things he did during that review was he stopped at a motorway . Service is just like I am now , and he plugged it in to charge it , because what you basically did was there's two parking spaces here in front of the charge of those there . You can park it there or you can park it here . If you park this car there , you've got to stretch this wire right across the bonnet and make a huge drama out of something that's essentially very , very simple . If you park it here , you don't stretch . You just put it in there . You plug it in , you switch it on and it charges . So as a tribute to the complexity of charging a car , here is a tragic numpty , filling a vehicle with a highly inflammable and toxic liquid .It is , of course , perfectly straightforward . We're all used to it . It's normal unless you think about it , in which case it's completely insane . You have to stand there on pumper liquid that's been extracted from deep beneath the earth's surface . Ship it , refine it , store it , transported . Then before you burn it in the engine , you have to go and pay for it . So that was quite an unusual experience , really . Petrol . I think it's the first time I've ever bought petrol live on fully challenged . What I've worked out there , I had to do you use a calculator . I couldn't in my head to think we've done 320I two miles for 39 quid , which works out 12 pence a mile , which I think , possibly for a supercar like this , that is , Let's be honest , terrifyingly quick .It's probably very good . I had a tweet today from someone who drives us , they said You know what ? It is Z8 thing . The BMW said thing , and he gets between 20 and 25 miles together , and this is doing about 55 so far has been some thrashes involved , so I could have probably gotten a little bit higher than that . You see , it's much harder to work out things like miles to the gallon than it is to work out .How many killer hours of using a battery . It's really easy with battery can see exactly how much you got When I was filling this . I had no idea if it was full . It went to June , kept stopping . Had to know how you people deal with petrol . Really scary Electricity is much easier anyway . Time for sport mode now , did you hear that ?You could hear that what happened thing was a gear change sound on an engine sound , which I've discovered a few minutes . I've been told it's not the rial noise of the engine and that it's a manufactured sound , and it took me a long time to work out where the sound came from until I put my hand on the speaker there and then when I changed gear , the noise is coming through the speakers that is completely fake . Sandra , so sophisticated that as you change gear , if you can hear , it's very subtle . It's only something a testosterone obsessed male but begin to notice . It is a little blip in the A3 engine sensor's bourbon door gives a little a little cough on the gate . Change it hurt would .You don't need to do that when you're driving because it doesn't for you . It should be city and rather mature , but I can't do this instead .End of demonstration .So what this car is is a carbon fiber shell . There's no chassis so that the front wheels are driven by an electric motor in the batteries on the rear . Wheels are driven by a very powerful three cylinder , 1500 cc petrol engine . And the overall result of that is truly , truly remarkable performance . Absolutely extraordinary at the touch of a paddle . This is what happens .So we've now done 50 miles in economy mode and 50 miles in sport mode , and it's really taught me a lot about this car first victim admitted about way just over 58 miles to the gallon , driving at the legal speed limit . Then we changed over changed over to sport mode , which I've been driving for those 50 miles . It's achieved 36.4 mpg , which is much more than I expected . Now it's very hard not to refer to , he who must be observed Mr J . Clarkes and a squat because this is the last car . As I've said before , this last card , he have reviewed on top here on the BBC a short one . Real review . But that's what he did on that , and he got 35 miles per gallon honestly , to get down to 35 . It takes a real effort . You have got to be constantly doing something like this , which I imagine he did quite regularly . It's used much less petrol than the equivalent sports car with the equivalent performance , which would have been doing at the most 20 miles together . This is what this car is made for . It really obvious it changes the whole nature of the car . It's why you'd buy . You just always have in sport . Why would you bother with you ? Because you're not buying a car like this to a zit economical on sensible form of transport , virtually no storage .It's really difficult to get your bags in and out . I put my neck out , reaching around to try and find something in the back . It's very small , and light and compact is quite difficult to get in and out off , You wouldn't go shopping in it . You wouldn't pick up the kids from school . You know , it's just it's not terribly useful , but that's not what it's for is so obviously for that .That's what it's all about , that it's enormous fun . I'm not gonna deny . Even though I've got my shades off , I'm trying to look cool . I know I look like a crack , but , you know , I'm really enjoying and we're getting to our destination quickly .Before we reached our destination , I discovered the BMW A8 does make a rather racy sound as it passes completely contrary to everything I've said anyway , Our destination was the hotel arms hotel in the Scottish borders , the highest residential hotel in Scotland , which , as chance would have it , has an electric car charger in the car .So it is an amazing car . It's a major step in hybrid technology and its enormous fun to drive .But I'm a bit of a vicar . It was actually a relief to give it back , and I didn't even get a speeding ticket .Thing is the BMW A8 plug in hybrid supercar . What is it ? Sir , this is the BMW . I A8 plug in a supercar .Sir ? This is the BMW A8 supercar . What is it , Sarah ?I'll tell you what it is is Gabi ? Why didn't you say smeg it ?"
30,51,i8,"welcome to another episode of fully charged Now I've heard a lot about the BMW A8 . I first saw it a swish event in London last year , but I hadn't had the chance to drive one until last week . It was a very short drive , meaning it was impossible to assess what it's true world fuel economy could be . But one thing is certain . This plug in hybrid is definitely a supercar . Now it's on . It's on now , is it ? It's kind of ignition is on . We just need to start it . Nothing will actually started , Right ? So do I just press the foot on brake ? Exactly . You got procedure now ? You know she's gone , right ? It says , ready basically . And then you can pop it into dry A5 , pressing a little button on the side whilst you put a little stick back . And because our seatbelts on it should just allow the handbrake to come off automatically . Yeah , could drive away , which could headed in that direction .Now , that is , if you can hear the engine because I can't tell where how moment just granted . Give what state The batteries right now . I'm gonna be honest right now . The battery Looks like it's almost empty . We've done a few rides already this morning , right ? And so on this drive , you're probably gonna be charging the battery as right as we go . Hopefully , the battle will be a little bit more charge when we get Thio nights running the course . So just quickly say , for me , I've read all this because now completely got it . I can't remember how big the engine eases . Okay , so it's a 1.5 leads a three cylinder . They call it a BMW . It's a twin power turbo , but it's basically one turbot with fins at different angles . Picks up the exhaust gases different different rates of anyway . It's a turbo on a 1.5 later three cylinder engine , right , because itself somehow does definitely feel just the sound of it . It feels Maur more muscular . Very throat isn't like what is extraordinary . Now driving . This is working out what's pushing me , Okay , because I'm very used to electric cars so occasionally it feels more like an electric motor that then felt like a petrol engine . Absolutely So they're both working . Yeah , different times . When required , they will both be working , doing different things . Sometimes it would just be one , sometimes just the other day at the moment , because of the kind of speech we're going and going up in the hills things because there's not very much electric . Our left is gonna be using predominantly 231 horsepower , right ? 200 for 1.437 foot traffic is extraordinary , highly experienced but not trained driver .And yet this feels like I'm in a really tight , close control . It goes exactly exactly what I'm very crisp , very extraordinary .That's the way that's good , petulant and then is it then it's rejecting . When I every time you left off that is charging trashcans . It's very hard not to love because there's a lot of people ask me , Don't you miss the sound of an internal combustion engine ? Actually , to be honest , I really don't okay , because I've got used to it . And they also once you get used to electric total compassion isn't sound clunky . And that I was following a bus . It's a challenge . That's a Yeah , Yeah , Well , yeah , when your electric Audi photos boss trust coming out , I'm just gonna have another go with that absolutely way following this round that I like that sound . Take him going up . You think you can because it's a 1500 . I mean , it's like like an engine . You'd having a little card that You mean it just doesn't sound great . Very hard not to love as a committed person who's who's committed to the end of the internal combustion .So what do you drive them ? What's your niece and leave ? Okay . Okay . You have done for three years . 42,000 miles . 43,000 .And they were you here . The petrol engine cutter , which is running on pure election For a moment , she didn't require much shock . I would love to have done it with a fully charged battery . Just to feel what ? The full electric .I don't care . It's around 25 miles . They dry . I think you could drive purely on electric , but obviously there's all those those things that I'm always asking . What could you get out of it ? Mpg wise if you drove very carefully . I mean , you don't know you well . The have looked into the miles per gallon figure . I don't know quite how it worked out with this because obviously it's No , they don't calculate that . Julianne Electric that it would be much more . But there's 100 and 13 mpg combined , right , which is which . From a colonized this they can do what ? We've just done a bunk . It's just really , really important .It's just because I'm obviously this is a top of the range , expensive sports car .It is not for average driver , but what it does is the technology is becoming so refined that it just becomes normal . Have you found it easy to drive on . This is ridiculously easy . I've never forced back is like a supercar . It's ultra futuristic . Yes , all this modern technology . But it's incredibly way it could be it every day .Yeah , way . Then put on helmets . Swapped seats on a specially designated circuit . Bradley showed me what this car could really do . We're now gonna have a drive with a proper driver . You can actually try this properly . Let me give me the verdict . Woman Finish ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah . So it's had its had the full vicar experience . I don't mean to denigrate Vickers . I'm sure some of them very , very risky drivers didn't change that .You're gonna reclaim my title ? No , vicar would drive like this .I can now understand that when this car returned to the base just before I go in it , there was a very , very strong smell , Very hard rubber .Now I know exactly what that is . Just extraordinary .Driving around the track in a hybrid car . A plug in hybrid car is just stunning . Audi Nora , I think my bowels of just four now I haven't used one . Exploited . Maybe I've been a bit of time . Help bring out thing is just staggering .Absolutely way must charge the battery is very important ."
31,52,M135i,"for the past eight months . This M 135 I has bean my everyday car . That's why it's filthy . But this is no normal . M 135 I we've been modifying it would be upgrading it . So I'm gonna talk you through everything that we've done to this car . We've also brought along on M to same basic platform . Same basic engine , but a riel m call . So how close have we got to building a real M car out of the M 135 ? Last summer we bought a 30,000 mile 2012 car for 17 and 1/2 �1000 .Today , prices started around �14,000 .Working with BMW specialised birds , we've upgraded the car over a course of a few months . The first modification we made was to the suspension beaning the standard BMW equipment in favor of Eye Back Springs and Bill Stein dampers . The new suspension is built a bird specifications . It isn't just off the shelf . We also fitted 10 mil spaces on the front axle . Next , we replaced the open differential with a queef LSD .At the same time , we also fitted a short shift kit on modified the clutch pedal .Finally , we re mapped the turbo charged straight six engine . The car is now in birds , be one specifications .The whole package of upgrades cost �6643 .Those are the upgrades that we've made those of the modifications . How did that she make the car feel right ? Let's start with the engine standard . It's about 320I horsepower . And now following the remap , it's 390 horsepower with about �420 for the talk . So it's a good up left in power , a massive up lift in talk , and you really feel it . One of the things that I really love about the rematch is that it hasn't fundamentally changed the character off the engine , so it's still got good thought response . It's still got good linearity . Turbo starts boosting nice and low in the REV range , and then it's got good energy at the top end , just like the standard car , you just have Maur off it , so if you put your foot down in fifth or sixth gear from 3000 rpm , you feel that muscular talk just really pull the car much harder than the standard map does and then right at the top end , get down to second gear right at the top end . There's a ferociousness to the power delivery , so the car feels much faster . But there's also more character just because there's more power . More talk .We've also made a couple of minor modifications to the gearshift . It's got a short shift kit on it now , so it's a much more direct , much tighter gear change . The standard car can be quite wallow we quite vague . This is lovely and tight . This car's also got a clutch pedal modification , which makes the pedal itself heavier . That's really lovely on a quick drive like this one , but when you're in traffic driving through town , it just feels a bit heavy , a bit unnecessarily heavy on the differential . So it's a quite if limited slip differential . It makes a huge difference . That's a massive improvement over the standard cost . The standard car , as it comes from the factory , didn't have an air less dear just hadn't opened death . Now the problem with that is that because even the standard car's got loss of power . When you get on the power away from a corner , particularly if you've got the traction on the stability control off . All that happens is the inside rear tire just lights up now with this quite LSD , when he gets on the power away from a corner that this bites and it sends the drive to both wheels . And so you get much better traction for one thing , much better drive away from the corner . But also , if you stand on the power really hard on both wheels , start spinning up . You know the car is going to slide , and then it's very controllable , is progressive and you simply Jews size of the slide with your right foot overall . Having that def in there just makes the car march or satisfying to drive , less frustrating on more controllable . It's a really good upgrade . The space is on the front axle . Just quite little 10 mil spaces on the front axle just wide in the track with a little bit make a good difference to the steering . It feels more positive now . Finally , this suspension biggest upgrade . We've made this car the first grade that we made as well . Spring rates have actually gone up slightly , about 10% but What they've done is taking a lot of rebound damping out off the dampers . Their rebound is the speed of which that wheel can drop out of the arch , having bean shoved up there by a bump or by the car leaning over an event . So we've got more spring right , and that does mean that particularly low speed and on a bumpy road there's a little bit of edge to the ride quality . That's true . But by taking out that rebound dumping , what you're allowing each wheel to do is to roll through potholes , roll through sunken drink covers rather than crashing through them , and that really improves comfort . But this car isn't about a limo like ride quality Overy cushion right quality . It's also know about being super stiff on super hard for the track . It's fast road set up , ready on . Where really starts to work beautifully is on a bumpy road when you're driving at speed . That's when you feel how brilliantly the suspension is working . The body is kept well controlled . Certainly much better control than the standard suspension did understand . A suspension . The body would float around the rear ends with corkscrew . It would get loose over undulations and compressions , and you have no confidence in it . Now the body is much better controlled . You also feel how well the suspension is working to keep each time pressed into the road . Only when the tire is pressed into the road can generate any grip . So what you find is that you've got much better body control . You've got more consistent grip , and as a result , you've just got more confidence .So what we're left with is a car that's very usable . But it's faster than a standard M 135 It's got their deaths .That's more fun . It's more controllable on the ride in . Handling balance is much better . I think it's a very good car this , But I wonder .How does it compare to an M two ? Well , it feels faster than an end to It isn't night and day , but the M 135 I has a more muscular mid range , and it rips harder right at the top end . But the M two has better traction . It has less power and talk and slightly wider rear boots .So of course it does . And where is the M 135 I is now on fixed rate dampers . The M two still has a comfort mode . That means it has a more settled ride quality in normal driving . The M two also has much wider tracks , front and rear , which means it steers more positively , and it feels more planted in corners on a bumpy road , though the M 135 ice shows it up . Where's the M two skips along a little . The M 135 I breeds with road surface . The suspension is beautifully damped .So there we go .It's faster than in them , too , and in some ways it's better to drive as well . But you know what ? I think the M two is a great car , particularly this face lifted version , which is much better controlled over bumpy roads than the previous one .So overall , yes , he probably do still want the end to . It's the proper M car isn't that it's got those wide arches .It looks fantastic .It's got a better cabin .You could build one of these M 135 eyes , one specifications , and it's a faster car for half the price of the M two That's almost all you need to know , isn't it ? Really ? It's half the price of the M two . If you can afford them , too , then it's a great car . It really is . But if you can't like me for half the price , you can have a very , very good approximation of it ."
32,53,Z4,"something of the bass . It's licorice , all sorts about BMW Z8 cars and that you never quite know what you're gonna get if you look back through the years , Zedd one said . Three , he said . Four , Said A8 . You find a roster of cars , which are mostly but perhaps not entirely , sports cars , mostly , but perhaps not entirely roadsters , mostly , but not entirely pretty small on fairly affordable . But that certainly shared an unconventional sporting character , which made every one of them memorable and different . If you like this video , don't forget , like M6 , Z4 in particular , has pulled a consistency to that said car line up over the last 10 or 12 years that has never really known before . Now this is the third generation version of that A4 inland Broken line . Like the last two , it's costal R8 trois come to the choices in line A4 A6 under engines on Line two . On the same , the incoming players just secrets . They may have seen Mr Breuer riding around in that aforementioned I quite liked it so well . It's a car with plenty of promising stunts . Headline A6 500E F40 . It's a little bit heavier than the outgoing G5 but it's got a low center of gravity , slightly short wheelbase wide tracks . All of that should pretty well for the way I am . It's got 10% more power , 20% more talk in the old car that's got a decent specifications .Well , this is obviously the end division , and you get 50 breaks , 19 inch wheels on active for a differential .Adaptive dampers on variables , steering , standing .So how does it feel ? Well , that has ever really been small enough .Schools Carina account as an alternative . Thio . The likes of the likes to leave new outpoint . 10 . It's a roadster , really .It's not a hot rod faster than before , but it just lacks that sense of compactness that Jenna , small , lithe wide on the road , feels fairly big . There's nothing wrong with the way it handles very secure , very planted two flats stable .What's a grip ? It's quite golden , you know . Called it really nicely . Plenty of balance . It's good . It's very precise . Corners ready , flattered , really balances out the balance . It's a roadster down a road like this . It's a lovely thing to talk about it , I must say . But you know , you get as much out of it just cruising around seven cents , enjoying the view , you know as you do what ? Pressing on going a bit faster . It doesn't . It doesn't reward you taking it by the scruff of the neck and really get the best . You know what ?When you did give it a bit of encouragement , what do you get back ? Well , the set for eats up straight for an appetite you don't find many council . It's tight corners with plenty of composure and precision . But maybe not with quite the handling balance or diversity of the very best �50,000 drivers cows .What should we know ? Well , it's got this new generation BMW in Syria when I'm told , a lot of it is actually shared with super , so this stuff will appear elsewhere . You get additional instruments ready , big time system lithe Feels like a car .You could drive a long way or use every day , and it's great fun . With that falls roof down , you can hear more genuine straight six engine noise , and BMW would normally allow these days carving your way along an interesting road .Enjoying the speed and diners your fingertips on under your right foot is enjoyable but doesn't do anything differently than it said car forebears . Is it much more enjoyable than , say , an Audi TT RS roadster ? Might be simply by virtue of being a classically powerful front engine , rear driven BMW the news . That force certainly leaves that open to question . I like it . But if you're after a convertible , is this the best drivers car you might buy ? Probably still go for the boxing in it .If you like this video , don't forget to click on like and subscribe below , or click here to watch our video on the Toyota Super ."
33,54,3 Series,"BMW three . Siri's has got a reputation for itself is the ultimate everything toe All Men Saloon , none more so than this new F40 model , which in 3 20 d guys managed to coveted five star auto car Road test . But actually this car's route begin with this . The 21 A3 Siri's , which first arrived in 1975 the 21 3 Siri's was actually a very different thing from the new three Siri's for start .It was three door only .And , of course , in 1975 you certainly wouldn't about a diesel engine . Economy just wasn't much of a concern .It may have been the first model to other three Siri's name , but this car still had a lot to live up to . It replaced the 2002 T , which is a fairly legendary car . This is actually the 3 20 which is the four cylinder too early to call this actual car bean , really immaculately refurbished by BMW Park Lane Classic , and I don't think you will find a cleaner example in The Land is extraordinary is only got 7000 miles on it , have done an amazing job now , whilst , of course , it was designed to be fun . I would still say this feels pretty archaic Next to the new three Siri's I love the way it right .It's got that real kind of floaty sensation that you get in a lot of seventies and eighties cars , but it's very loose and it's very heavy , and everything about it feels quite old fabulous .But old Theo A3 Siri's didn't just have to be fun back in the seventies . That had to be really high quality , and you can see that they've managed that .Consider that in 1979 when this particular car was manufactured , the Austin Allegro and the Morris Marina .We're in the top five best selling cars , and you can see how the three Siri's managed to justify its high �4800 price tag .I think this is one of the best examples . We will see just how far cars have progressed in the last few decades . Theme New F 30 is quite an amazing thing . It really is such a rounded product , and I think more so even than the E 21 was back in its day . What do you think ? The style is quite such a progression . We'll let you make your mind up on that .The new A3 Siri's may lack some of the charm of the old car , but it really is the most incredible , all rounded proposition on it . Does everything you could want over 21st century cars economical is fun is desirable . It's easy to live with . We described it in our road test as brilliant , unsurpassed orbit flawless , and I think that pretty much says it all .Still , A3 Siri's didn't get to where it is today without a word . The ancestor topping its evolutionary line on the 21 is certainly that ."
34,55,M6,"the new BMW M6 . It doesn't get much more exciting , and that doesn't G550 to brake horsepower 500E two foot from a 4.4 liter V8 bi turbo . It certainly sounds promising , but not make a point here . We're doing about 70 miles an hour .Normal road surface here is a bit noisy , but listen to this here . How refined this car is . It's so easy to drive and its proper lavish as well .It's really comfortable gtc tile . You get all sorts of comforts , like the wind screen sat .Now , if you get all variables on the settings , I have A3 Gae Bok settings , three steering settings . Three down the settings on three engine settings and you can have any combination .And that's what BMW has done with this M6 . They've made it much more of a tour .They've also made it �94,000 or near as , and that's quite expensive .Have BMW compromised . M6 is essential purpose as a fun , exciting , and you're really thrilling sports car . Well , tell you what , let's stick it in m two on , uh , get everything on maximum attack , Find out .I think there's no doubting that there is much excitement to be out of unbelievably mean , frighteningly rabbit .You have to be going out to get it to sound like it does handle well .I'm not saying that this car there's no hard because it does . For 1.8 tunnel , more than one A8 body rolls progressive . It grips . The steering is lovely , really get a sense of what's going on . It's really well weighted , although its pluses too heavy . Frontal progressions good . This power trade is amazing . There's so much about this car , which is just brilliant .It's got 552 break at the same time , it has a combined economy of over 28 N v g . That's it's such a great engineering achievement . But yet when you really wanted to deliver , it just doesn't have that final level of poison excitement that you want .That's what you've lost in favor of it becoming more usable every day . Maybe it's a purist , but if you're expecting car performance and shine , I think you might be living with this point"
35,56,3 Series,"We're now some 40 years , more than 50 million units and six full model generations into the astonishingly successful life story of the BMW three . Siri's thistles . The new one , The 7th 1 a car that a great many people who do a great many UK motorway miles every year we'll have been waiting for , You know , even though we're generations deep , no into X1 Z8 X3 Zone one Siri's This is still the most important on the biggest selling car BMW makes . You can buy one in March 2019 and today we're gonna drive this 3 20 D on the road and M3 40 eye on the track before we start . Don't forget to subscribe below . If you enjoy this video and click the bell to turn on notifications this time around , New really does mean you for what's probably the world's defining compact executive Saloon car . BMW switched this car onto the lightweight aluminium and steel cluster architecture platform used by its biggest saloons . It has made three Siri's a few inches longer , about half an inch wider than the last .Car interiors had a big redesign .More on that later , the car suspension and steering systems have been wind , the redesigned and re specified and the familiar range of four and six and under petrol and diesel engines will feature some animal knew . Others haven't been given thorough overhauls .What do you think ? The pictures have been out a while now ? It's been a couple of motor shows . Fair to say . The reaction has bean a little bit mixed . Some people think it's great , great looking car , but the people that kind of take issue with a few things on it , maybe the grills to big headlights aren't quite right . Wheels it blinky . Maybe generally , it's just a slightly overwrought , fussy kind of surfacing treatment for a three Siri's . I have to say , I've got a foot in both camps on this . I think it's one of the better looking silly in cars around the moment . But we hold BMW to a very high standard for design , don't we , Andi ? I don't think this car's got the perfect proportions of , like any 30 or 46 or even dare I say it out . For Julia , it looks fine when the sun shining on it like this on a sort of a gray morning covered in dirt in Basingstoke .Well , right , we'll start in the 3 20 shall we ? That's the important one . After all , there's a few technicalities to cover before we crack on the force , and the engine in this car is new . Instead of using twins , girl turbochargers like the last one uses to sequential turbochargers a big one on the little one , and it makes the same peak . Power and pick talk is the last two litre did G20 day , but it's alleged to be more efficient on more responsive A3 . 20 D Peak power is 100 and 87 horsepower picked or is �295 foot . You can have two litre turbo petrol power in the 255 4th power 3 30 i or a three litre turbo straight six engine , either the 3 30 d or in the M3 40 . Only that I'll be driving on track like , you know , given it's only a four cylinder diesel , the engines pretty strong . It's a 400 diesel , so it's always gonna be more about talking power . It's never gonna sound that great way , know that , but judge by the right standards , it actually robes really cleanly pretty much all the way to the red line of 4000 right ? Um , really nice , broad spread of talk . You can sort of tell that maybe BMW hasn't got the refinement measures in this car that it puts in the biggest leans A5 siris because the engine sounds a little bit gruff at times when you work it when you rev it , yet you can tell it's a four cylinder diesel . It's not the most refined engine off its kind , but then BMWs have never been outstanding in that respect . It's fine . It just sounds like a force into diesel .But it's a good one . Come out to chassis and suspension has a bit more of a departure to report there . So , yes , the car is bigger in the last three , Siri's got longer wheelbase , but the front track has actually grown in greater proportion and beyond all that you've got , stiffer springs is different . The roll bars stiffer mountings , more negative camber on the front axle , and all of that's going on below a body structure that's 25% more rigid than the last three . Siri's . That's what gives BMW permission to stick up the chassis rights without compromising the right . Hopefully , the really an innovative thing in the chassis , or what BMW calls lift related dampers now , then adaptive dampers and such . But they do have little individual structures within the reservoirs that actually provide Maur damn possible at the extremes of the travel . So A4 compression but full rebound dampers just work a little bit hard , harder for the car , and that allows them to perhaps be a little bit more laid back in fluent right in the middle of travel on that provides more ride comfort theory anyway , you don't want knows . You could have shorter , firmer M6 port suspension springs , which also come with firmer anti roll bars yet more negative camber for those front wheels on variable sport steering and then beyond that . If you want to go even further , you can have adaptive M6 suspension with proper adaptive dampers . DVD , although by and large A3 Siri's by don't tend to go quite that far , which intrigues me , nothing BMW done it so spaced out . The ratios in the eight speed automatic gearbox in the car gets so the shorter ones , the level ones a shorter the high ones are taller and at times . Maybe when you're using manual mode , sometimes you feel like you're in the wrong gear . You know your gear higher , then you expect to be on the computer . But weird sometimes when you just sort of tooling around town and like fourth and fifth .But even in Dr It's Really slick works really well and apparently being abused in a lot of work on the six speed manual box that's in this car standard . So it'll be interesting to see what that's like when we get a chance , right ?So the crux of the matter how the ride and handling spot on , I would say better and respect the handling . Maybe a little bit of a trade off on the right , but but a perfectly acceptable right one , I would say so , yes , there's a firmness to the ride . I mean , you almost wouldn't describe it as firmness it It's never course . It's just a little bit excitable . It wants to deal with bigger infants quickly and then get on with it . On the trade off is a car that handles really , really nicely . It's precisely eternity in balance . Did you drive it through ? It feels classically rear driven . It's kind of everything you wanted . Three serious to beat , and it's no to dialed up . So the initial off center steering response is fairly gentle , actually . Feel the front tires load up , get lots of confidence . And then if you go , you just sort of enticed to drive it on quicker and quicker and to have a lot of fun with it .And this is just the full set in two days .All right , this is impressive , right ? So we'll park up . We'll talk about interior .So this is the all new interior A3 Siri's first impressions . It's a really upmarket treatment in here . This is a sports car . It's got aluminium trim , but it looks really plush . Still , BMW have obviously noticed we're up against a Mercedes C class on Audi A4 . Both of those cars are really upmarket cars all of a sudden , and this is the response , and it's pretty good .We got additional instruments in front of us . You get elliptic gauges speed on from the left , rev . Counter on the right , Rev Counter reads backwards . I'm not sure there is easy to read as they might be , and they look a bit stylized But you know , whatever floats your boat . All the controls were organized in what they call islands . So it's supposed to look neat and tidy as well as be easy to use . You supposed to be able to find things very easily . I think you can prefer these drive my buttons all individually collectible like that rather than a toggle on Dhe Still feels like a pretty small car inside .But I can sit behind me on dhe . I'm not small letters , you see . So the car as BMW latest .I drive seven in pretend just a minute . It's got a bigger touch screen . It's all touch screen bull . And you could still use the old Dr Rotary Control if you prefer . The new innovation about it is is an all new voice control system which allows you to speak really naturally , Terry , as if it was another human being . And you can call it what you like . If you want to call it Charlie , you call Charlie , you wanna call the kit ? You should call Kit , but it will always recognize how you BMW Hello . What can I help you with ? Take me to the race track of pulled him out .Okay , then welcome to the L Guards . Most visited tourist attraction among the motoring journalist fraternity these days .Quarter mile circuit Somewhere in the new top of the range version off A3 Siri's M3 40 i , this guy uses a newly developed version off three litre straight six twin turbo motor that we've seen in the kind of upper level A3 Siri's for awhile . 300D 69 horsepower . This time it produces �369 for the talk , which makes for a knock to 62 miles an hour acceleration claim of just 4.4 seconds . In this car , you get the active M6 port rear diff .You have to pay extra for that part of other M6 cars .A3 330I Both ought to be pretty decent sports car certainly got the makings of it , given that new , active diff has been developed in the one on the outgoing M3 .Eventually thing about this car is it's extra . It is four wheel drive Now .By my reckoning , this is the first time I think since 1977 BMW hasn't sold standard droid version off A3 series with a six cylinder petrol engine who yeah , that kind of feels like a big change to me .Some people may be made just a little bit uncomfortable . I think what it means is this car better Be damn good to drive the handling better be spot on . So let's find out .Well , okay . Feels pretty real by someone . Say this car has the optional adaptive damping that comes at extra cost .So I got in sport . Plus I guess that means the extra system set up for the sportiest told Mr Briefing . Anyway , it's balanced .It's certainly fast on . I've got the DFC switched off just to see how poised how Rhea driven this thing can feel when it wants to . So let's see . Second Gear Corner , I guess around . Yeah , I mean , we know this that way . We know four wheel Drive is nothing to be worried about when it comes to the balance handling balance with four Door Saloon these days we have seen evidence of this a lot recently , but normally we see in proper M cars where you can just turn off the front drive shafts completely . Orin Mercedes-Benz G's you know , proper upper level performance sports . That's not what this is . This is kind of the top of the normal range three series , and technically , I haven't really done anything to the four wheel drive system . It's just being just being itself . It just being A3 series for your sister being pretty adjustable , isn't it ? It's sort of a step on from active . A4 will drive systems that we've known , so you could just get a bit more attitude in the car . Use a bit more opposite . Look before the drive line , start shuffling , talk forwards again and put in the car out . This life , it just feels more Red River natural cornering balance of a car is really good as well . It turns in really kingly . There's not a hint of understeer in it , and body control is great . And the faster you go , the better the car get .This is on 19 optional wheel sports attire . I've been driving it pretty hard now for a while . Tires are really holding on quite nicely .Breaks a standing up .I think it sounds really good as well . I was just into them roar up down the pitch strike before I got in a job Well done . I think honor is restored .Wait you haven't BMW Defining Compact Executive Saloon may not be quite as compact as it used to be , and it may not be quite as great to look at , though That depends on your point of view , but it's got a clearer sense of luxury and technological wizardry about it now than it ever has before on despite its size , it also does what every generation with this car has done so well over the decades , delivering more engaging drunk than you'll find in so many of the Saleen of this kind and as ever , by convincing you more by what it does and what it is that it might just be one of the very best cars in the world .Stay tuned to order cars YouTube from or three Siri's content problems just as soon as we can bring it to you .

36,57,M5,"This , then , is the new sixth generation BMW M5 .It has a 600 horsepower , 4.4 litre twin turbo charged V8 have to put that onto the road . It has for Dr on the outside .Subtle , isn't it ? It looks a bit like any other fires . There is . It isn't pumped up , muscled out like , say , BMW em too . But look closer . There are vast cooling ducts at the front . Court exhausts surrounding a diffuse at the rear , on in between those a carbon fibre roof .What's it like ? This is a big car , you know . It's five meters long , two meters wide , 1.95 tons .Actually , this is a twisty road , and it's quite pleasant , actually , is quite feeling it feels quite dynamic . Everything is his own forward drivers on but its most stable mode . But because the steering is quite quick , not much more than two turns to autumn turns quite fast direction change . But that isn't nervous in a straight line , which is important in a car like this , isn't it , because it's built for going ridiculous speeds on Autobots . But let's say that you don't just want to go quietly , smoothly and easily from one place to another . You want a bit more dining .Okay , so there's quite a lot to talk you through mechanically , which is why I've stopped . It's a 4.4 liter V8 at the front . There was before , but this one has new turbo charges . The injection pressure is up to 3 50 bar , and it now drives through a conventional automatic rather than a dual clutch auto . More significantly than that , it drives to all four wheels . But this is where it gets Penis like complicated , right . We get modes for everything , right normally is rear wheel drive biased , and it pushes power to the front when it needs it . That's even in standard four wheel drive mode , But there is also a sport four wheel drive mode , which puts even more power to the back and then only a little bit to the front . And then , if you do certain things with your stability control to turn it off , you could put it exclusively into rear wheel drive as well you might . Even with DSC off , you can still choose between three different four wheel drive Mose , and they still do three different things on top of that . There are three modes for engine response . Sport sport , plus deficient .There are three moves for the adaptive dampers . There's comfort sport sport . Plus , there are three modes for the steering . Wait doesn't change the steering speed or anything . It's just electric . Paris's steering . Conventionally , you can put that in comfort , which is like through to sport plus , which is really heavy on top of all of that as well , don't you believe instead of just a sport mode for the video governments , a sport mode for the gear lever as well ? You can also then put these up and down on it just changes the sort of registered the Gables changes like that . That was what will .Anyway , let's go for a drive and we'll see how all of this I will start off then with everything in soft mode if you like . So I've got the engine inefficient .I've got the dampers and comfort steering , waiting comfort , noisy exhaust off . This is , after all , a business express , so it's fair to assume there will be times when all you wanna do sit back , relax , just get to somewhere briskly , quietly and easily , so reasonably comfortable Actually , the engine is doing what night ?For case . 50 miles an hour . The engine is faded to nothingness .That gearbox is changing up quickly , Smoothly , easily on the right is fine .You get 19 inch wheels a standard and get twenties as an option .This is them . Comes on a sort of not quite iron discus standard with carbons . Ram M6 an option . They reduced the Unstrung Mass as well as just last a bit longer on circuit .Put it in confirmed driving stabilization right now . I mean dear seat off . You see , this is where it's dumped , isn't it ? It's just too much going on . I need to get to the menu . He's got a vehicle . Get him set up my ex drive right now . I can stop changing that , but I'm already on the road . I'm gonna be on . So I possibly think there's too much going on on the choice front . It's No . One . You have to have two of these buttons appear which of which part of the program didn't .But anyway , I gotta go to four wheel drive sport in any of the four with supposed to only really put a pound to the front when the rear start to slip . So what's the thinking ? Is mostly rear drive , anyway and pushes power to the front when it needs to . So can feels BMW , wishing that from injury will drive fashion all the time anyway .But the exhaust on yet another thing you can change it does augment the noise slightly through the speakers . Right ? Someone comes from there , but by all accounts , has tried toe upped the ante off the exhaust toys . Andi , I think it's fair to say that probably succeeded . No , I was angry is an E 63 AMG . Those AMG engines do make a really special noise inside and out . This is more refined than that , I guess . More subdued , they say .I guess the exterior isn't really This is a bit more honestly , I think probably the right comfort to this is a bit more executive car .That then does sports lose stuff when you really want it to any 63 is always a bit more bit more edgy . See what this is good . This has got loads of poise and even interesting even on the road . Just if you just give it a little bit of a tickle of the front , lower corner and just strains the line . Even A4 . We'll drive sport mode . It's quite rewarding , engaging . I like that most about fun . Isis . Becks will come if you put it . Two wheel drive might need a circuit for that . We have one . Not for very long . Couple of laps , that's yes . See deactivated . Could figure extra . I've now me , too . On immediately there's been nine balance . A big , naturally A3 will drive Car E Oh , I like it . I like it . No .See what what is like to experience on the road into Will Drive may expect 95 cents . You notice any difference whatsoever , But just as you X6 corners , it just doesn't feel that little bit more . Never gets quite as angry as me 63 does . It never gets quite a CZ growly , but it's always It's always that little bit soft , right ? Things always that little bit more subtle , I suppose . M cars Quite often . You know what I think ? I rather like that . I think you'd rather like that , too . What I like about it is it's it's It's not just doing what A6 A3 does . The AMG and BMW em both do pretty different things , similar things . But in a way , I've got an awful time for both of them , Actually , which would you choose ?You know , I think it's a really tough question . I'm probably a question for another day ."
37,58,M2,"BMWs .Little ist m carving the air , too . A4 Steel body to the M two ways . Only 25 kilos less than a carbon fibre roof M3 .And it also has a three litre straight six engine under the bonnet . That's not a sort of small , light ready unit like a Toyota GT 86 is it ? Let me show you the power and talk rough for that . For that motor . �370 feet of talk from 40 100 Treves all the way through to Ford . That's a big bruising muscle car type of engine , and it is not simple inside , either .There are three different driving modes that change the adaptive dampers steering late , the gearbox response , the engine response . Then there's an active , limited slip rear differential that I need to tell you the text about here it locks up .The look is also closed by the required percentage through enthusiastically driven curves according to the levels of lateral acceleration on Dr at Work .So given the 46 grand to he's barely any lighter than M3 or in Fort has 60 horsepower less is it just 1/2 hearted poor man's version orbits bigger brothers . In a word , I think he's really , really so I forgot . Well , ostensibly to Siri's body , but it's wider by inches overall to fit within it .Largely aluminium M3 A4 suspension straight six engine has been tweaked up to 365 horsepower , and it drives through either a seven to beat D C X6 because manuals evacuated X6 downshifts to smooth . That's okay . There it is . Very good boys , Right . Well , I don't like the option to turn it off . You can turn it off the any way I can find your way . Might like the option of going that way .Eyes 2002 A3 morning car is going to be Oh , let it made its substance in the nuptial of the discoveries of it . Smooth it does feel does it does feel like the way this just brings it on that extra step its brevity .They get large A6 . But there are advantages as Portia is probably living . Having A6 wait expensive rich sound something like this .I'm not going to turn up now just plus on DSC off . But by no means is the steering Tonto .It's a smooth from from agent Wait"
38,59,M3,"Now the difference between a car nut on someone who simply likes cars is that the car nut will agonize over the small decisions . They will look at the small print about the process of going to drive that new car , and they'll think about it for days . They won't sleep properly the night before , I didn't sleep very well last night , just thinking about love in his new car . Here's a barmy one for you . Shoot choice . That's what we opened on shoes . I think that the pair of shoes I'm going to wear for that first drive in the M3 are crucial . Let's have a look at some options . The heavy boot to be avoided , the sort of smart brothel ecri Paree thing again too bulky to be avoided . The training shoe like running , but it's no good for these purposes . Now we're getting closer . This is almost the perfect first driving DAP , but she's a bit Pawnee , so I won't wear that sort of disco train . Everything light Good contact patch Good . Better feel through there . I like that again to be avoided . The racing boot . I've heard it's happened before that a man has turned up to drive his new car wearing a racing boot . I only hope that someone shot him on the way home . Avoid reading material . You might have to spend some time waiting in the showroom before the cars bought out . You might as just this accident weekly Car magazine called Auto Car . It's the original car wickets , also the World Oldest car magazine . Now for May . If you get the footwear right , you get the clothing right and you've got a copy . Wars . The car to read while you wait for the car to come out . There is only one more thing to get sorted , and it's crucial . What tunes do you listen to during those first few miles ? Those bonding miles within You can . Here we go . Here's a selection of what I would like to listen to today , The editor's first album . I thought that was very good as well . Queens of the Stone Age . Is there a better rock band ? A4 Driving ? I don't think so . Foo Fighters . You can't really go wrong . This is controversial . Yes , Minister , You think I'm mad , but if you're stuck in a traffic jam , you don't listen to the queens of the Stone Age . You'll listen . Sister Humphrey talking Absolute Bobby's Traveling Wilburys . Yeah , good stuff . Good driving music . Some sort of dancy business because that could be quite good as well . Now , important dunce . That looks like an 80 year . That's an album by a band called the Prodigy . Avoid them like the plague because you will overdrive the car , either crash it , get courts beating or over of the Indian . Likewise , a C D . C . Nutters music has its place , but not during that first dr of a piece of kit . This thing Mobile phone . Statistically , you are more likely to have a problem with your card during that first drive than at any other time . And you want to go to phone the garish as they come and get me on now , having sorted footwear . Very important clothing . Not quite so important music tantamount to the most important thing you can do in a car . You're sorted . You are ready to go and drive your new car .Now before you even drive in Utah . Oi ! Please tell me you're like me . You like to have a poke around . Look at stuff . Make sure it's all okay . Just sort of soak it all up , maybe look for a few blemishes . Come on . Things I've spotted about my new M3 .Do you think that gap there's a big old like It's too wide or something . The panel gaps in the rest of the car are absolutely spot on , but where this skirt means there's this sort of crevice that'll make no difference to the ownership proposition of this car . But I find it a touch irritating . Maybe I'm sad . Come around here . You'll think this one's even weirder when you look here . This , this is called a satin finish line , probably cost about 400 quid or something preposterous like that . There's some ceiling under here , and it's just about a millimeter proud . I've actually nudged it back in my son , but you just see there , it just comes out of it . That marked me out as a very , very sad individual , but I've still noticed . How about this is ? Well , get a camera now . Obviously , there's some wax in this thing to stop rust getting into crevices that aren't really galvanized . But the way the wax just dribbles out from the bottom of the door there , it just looks like my dog's had away on the side of it . I find that irritating . Unless I'm mistaken . There is some orange peel on that paint the paint job . Okay , the color . I think the color is fantastic , but there is some orange peel on just about every panel . Bit disappointing . Okay , one more thing . One more thing .Have a look under here . So you're following me and my white M3 ineffably thinking , Who is that twerp in the white M3 ? I'm thinking it's all white and silver , but when you look down here amounts that hole that matter . Back box on a bright red just looks really weird when you follow it to great big lumps of red rubber . Now I'm playing Devil's Advocate because I think it's a wonderful looking car , and I think it looks . I think it looks so punchy and white , and none of these things really matter to me at all . I wouldn't reject the car because of them , but it's funny , isn't it ? When it's something brand new and it really matters to you , you go over it with a tooth cut , so you make the preparations .You choose the music , you get the perfect footwear on you go through the rituals that you can't really explain to people that don't like cars because they make you look really quite weird . Then you get in the car like I am now . This car is now done 26 miles . So I've done 16 miles in my new car .You know what is the most bloody frustrating thing on the planet ? Can't stand it . I'm limited to five and 1/2 1000 rpm . You can't get anywhere near that . You've got a nurse . The gear change . You gotta nurse the brakes . Really ? You want to get out of spite ? Nothing stupid , and you can't . So you just saunter around . The unavoidable truth is that those first few special miles in your new car of the least fun you never have with it ? They're frustrating . I know that The e 92 M3 is the guy I've been wanting to run for . Young's now , innit ? I'm doing 50 miles an hour and I'm not really enjoying it . Only feedback can tell you is that when you use five and 1/2 1000 rpm , new M3 is a quite boring and be not very fast . I have a solution to the problem .However , next week , when it's had its first little service and done enough miles , I'm allowed to make the rev . Counter Needle go around to this bit here where it says , A8 , there's a nice red blob . I'm gonna drive it to the Nurburgring . I'm gonna rinse it over many laps off the North life . If that sounds over the top , then so be it . But after all this frustration , I think I deserve to give it a good girl .Right . As we approached the tolls , I now know that I'm not really nailed this car yet . A little bit terrified . Look at my hands on a Don't say enough . Apologize . Yes . If you want to go skids , you can ."
39,60,M5,"theme . New M5 says BMW is a cleaner , more economical , more socially aware machine than the snarling gas guzzler it seeks to replace .Its twin Turbo V eight engine , for example , might not be as pure as traditionalists would have liked , but it's still produces 10% more power on burns , 30% less fuel . So this , then isn't ecologically responsible .M5 a car that isn't going to ruin our planet in its quest to deliver the ultimate driving through , well , sort off .So the hard points off the new BMW M5 . It costs �73,000 .It has 552 . It will get to 60 miles an hour in 4.4 seconds on DDE . It's limited rather ridiculously , to 155 miles an hour .But this car is so much more when you start driving thanks from the outside , it does sound nuts . There is no doubt about it , but from the inside , I am a little bit disappointed that it doesn't make a bit more noise . This is full throttle in third gear .I mean , it's a nice enough noise , but I just want a bit more off it to tell Mei to confirm to my ears that this is actually an M5 .One thing that they didn't get right at all in the old car was gay box . First time that they used a proper sequential gearbox in M5 , and they made a bit of a mess of it . But blimey , they have corrected that mistake this time . Give us in this car . He's fantastic bots . You've actually got less selection modes . You have five last time now , even A3 , so they kind of made it less impact . But this shift changes the shift speeds and just the smoothness of the way you can upshift or downshift is just amazing . The gearbox in this car is for me the standard item amongst quiet .I've been trying to work out what this car feels like when you put your foot down and go up through the gears and I've done it . It feels a little bit like you getting in the way just sucks the horizon towards you . I guess you can't really pay BMW engineers because I don't know and M5 it feels like a vagrant . That's mental , but it's true .Now let's come to one of the crunch matters which is how much this car weighs . 1945 kilograms . That is ridiculous . Range Rovers used to weigh less than that not too long ago , however , I don't have it done it BMW chassis Engineers have managed to make this thing really handled on dhe . Really right . It feels as if it weighs about 1600 kilograms . So they pulled up right trick there , right ?The steering . It is good with a small D . Why ? I think it feels a little bit fake . To be perfectly honest , it's very accurate . You could be very precise where you put the nose , but the field is a bit weird , and that is because there's a bit more steering that meets the eye . In fact , I might have to slow down , stop and show you what's what it's all to do with the EM drive system because you've now got two buttons which changed not only the characteristics within the steering , but also the dampers and the throttle response on gear change speed as well . So really , what you're ending up with is an Elektronik artificial field to the steering in all of its modes , and it never quite nails it in any of them .So it's obviously a very good car than you M5 . But is it a great one ? Whoa , yes , and it's the overall picture .It's not just the straight life for which is absolutely nuts .It's the ride , the handling , the refinement , everything it does .It does , really . And you know what ? Overall , I'm glad they didn't turn it down too much because it is at heart , still a proper lunatics ."
40,61,760i,"I'm sat in a BMW 7 60 Ally , and it's really very comfortable , but it's really very fast as well .It's powered by 6.6 liter V 12 Twin Turbo with six years and nine horsepower and 800 Newton meters , and it's got a will drive on dhe . It's very quick to 60 miles an hour . That's not demonstrating now . So driver launch it .Not six day Michael . This is fast , and that is I can see 100 ways still go in . This one is actually limited to 189 miles an hour . We don't know for a it's really quick , but also surprisingly relaxing . That's 161 160 times . I'm bottling and I drive a slow down . Come on , calm down , calm down . It's Stacey wanted . Maybe just chill out watching telly instead .It's like taking off in business class . It is .The M 7 60 ally has some styling changes over the normal seven series to make it stand out , such as more aggressive and deeper from bumpers . You also have 20 inch lightweight alloy wheels and blue brake calipers . There's some side skirts to make it look like it's hugging in the ground and in the back . You can get there seven series with a little boot lips spoiler , which is a bit unusual and then low down . You got deeper rear bumper again on what you got . Bigger exhaust pipes actually exhaust by Seymour exhausts around pipes actually in there . But it's not fake . I guess it's the thought that counts .One also counts is the thing that's at the other end of those exhaust pipes . The thing I love about V 12 engines that they are silky smooth . I'll show you . Now let's remove this plastic engine cover . Grab myself a bottle of water , place it precariously on there on tick over your serious holly reports in the water . But if I rev the engine will flex the whole car , watch this , and that brings me onto the sound that 6.6 liter engine makes . When you have this car in comfort mode , it's relatively quiet , even when you rev the engine .But when you put into sports mode opens involving the exhaust that it's a lot more raucous .If you ever somehow forget just how many cylinders the car is packing , there are some not so subtle reminders to help you remember .Get V 12 budges here on the rare palace on and on the inside .There's another thing . 12 . Budge here near the gear selector , and you get them on the kick plates .Definitely 12 . However , this means the M 7 60 ally is also definitely rather expensive to this car . Cost . �135,000 . But don't worry , BMW have chuck quite like it .It's so a standard . You get a lovely Bowers and Wilkins stereo with these handsome metallic speakers . There's also the automated driving system , so adaptive cruise control with lane keeping assessed .However , for some reason , if you want a lovely Alcantar headlining , you have to pay an extra �145 . What is the point of a �145 option on a �135,000 car ? Just not worth the paperwork ? Really ?Thankfully , a lot of the stuff you have to pay extra for on the normal seven , Siri's does comes standard on the M 7 60 like a ceramic finished of the controls , upgraded leather interior on dhe sport is steering wheel .Despite all this though you may be wondering why you'd want to the M 7 60 over the cheaper M5 . After all , that car is luxurious enough . He's super quick . And , of course , it's a proper , full blooded M car . Well , some speed freaks will just prefer the 7 60 is less focused driving experience .This does feel like a softer car . Doesn't the bombs a little bit better but more cushioning for the air suspension on quieter as well when he hit the bombs ?It doesn't feel quite so overly sporty in terms of the economy , while I'm getting around 25 miles per gallon performances strong , all of a sudden , the average economies dropped five mpg . Let's see what happens again . Look , you can just destroy the cars dropped by another due mals Miguel . And then let's not do that anymore . I want to get to our destination without having to fill up again .The M 7 60 is great for cruising on the motorway on despite its huge size and 2.2 ton weight , it's not a complete disaster on a twisty road , either .It's oil drive system has been tweet to beam or rear drive biased . Also , there's active anti roll bars to stop the car leading too much in the corners or the rear wheel steering aids , low speed agility on high speed stability . And , of course , you can choose from a range of different driver settings , depending on your mood or the road you're on summer . Playing two sports mode to stiffen up the suspension makes the engine sound louder on dhe , the gearbox more responsive at any war . It's a little bit greasy , R8 air , so I'm thankful that I've got four wheel drive traction .What I'm not thankful for is the heavy 6.6 Leovy 12 front ways . Quite a lot . So it does feel like a bit of a brute to manhandle round here .The brakes have definitely getting a bit more work out .However , despite the M in the name of the M 7 60 isn't a hooligan carp . It's more sophisticated , more civilized , so just accept it for what it is . A quiet and luxurious limousine that could double there's a drag right set .You know what I found ?

And then after about 10 minutes of the video , finally reveal what my new daily driver is . I'm gonna reveal it right now , but before I do , I want to see if you can guess what it is . So click on the pop out badly in the top rank on the screen to vote . Do you think I've got a Mercedes E 63 BMW A8 ? Siri's a brain Drover sport or an Audi Q A8 . You can see good . I can now reveal that my new daily driver is Tara of all Focus . Yeah , Actually , I will be driving this car a bit because it's on loan to car wire for six months from Ford , so we couldn't see what it's like to live with , and I will be testing this car , but my dad divers actually over here , look , here is it's a BMW A8 , Siri's and 8 40 to be precise .

So if you want to see some behind the scenes stuff , then follow me on Instagram at Matt Watson Cars keep today .Now a lot of you might be thinking , Oh , number .

So I'm gonna launch it . Got in sports mode on We're holding the break . It's a brave And then release the brake . She spoke of the ray wills a bit S90 60 miles an hour dealt with in 5.1 seconds . It's not too bad , I think , without the world spirit didn't even better . Let's try it again . Okay , let's have a second attempt . Then I'm gonna put the car into sports plus mode for extra dynamic settings . So it happens . Will it help ? A little bit attraction issue , but not much . I got it .A shave 0.1 of a second off it . It's five seconds longer . Do now is just turn off the stability control . Where we go , it's off on gonna warm up my tyres to see if that helps May .Yes , this is four wheel drive , but it's really Dr biased on it will slide around of it .Right . That should do it . Tonight . I'm gonna put the stability control into the traction Dynamic setting Got in sport plus again , third time . See if we can beat five seconds .What's about Launch way guy ? What you gonna do ? I have made a difference . No , 64.6 seconds . That is quite for a diesel . It is not boring people . Okay , so I've proved to you that the diesel is quick , but you still won't be won over by because listen , yeah , it's still a Rackley . Diesel would be much better . This is a nice , beautiful sounding V8 admit . Well , there's some good news you say I'm gonna keep this 8 40 d for three months . So it's actually with various tested it in various videos for you guys . Some drag races as well . And then I'm gonna swap it for the M 8 50 I the 4.4 litre twin turbo V8 which can't do naught to 60 in 3.7 seconds . They will be quicker . So I'll try that car after three months And keep that for further . Three months to Don't worry , I will be getting the petrol .Now , I should point out this car looks rather like the M 8 50 I really won't tell the difference because it has the M Sport technique package on it . So that includes some aerodynamic body styling . You've also got M6 breaks for stopping power . It's actually got a rear differential as well . From the m es 50 i for bad corner extinct traction . You've got an M staring , Will . You got Alcantar headlining inside this M sink belts as well This cause also got Look , the Corbin roof .Now all this stuff combined ads around five grand to the price .Other options fit to this car . I will explain some of them now .So one of the extras fits in this car is the technology pack .It does cost �2800 which is quite a lot of money for you to get quite like it included in it , such as an autonomous driving system which effectively lets the car drive itself pretty much when you're on the motorway , demonstrate that in another video because now on to demonstrate some other kids , you get included in the technology pack the parking assistant .So this is a big car , so it can be tricky to park . But with the parking assistant , the cold park itself in a space as long as it's more than 80 centimeters long in the car itself . So that's about that much . So here we have quite a tight space . I'm gonna get the car to park itself in that gap . The way this thing has just happened , the car's main infotainment screen has just gone blank . It's switched off . I didn't turn it off . If I press on and off , it doesn't seem to do anything the digital drivers displays working fine . So it's a little screen for the ventilation system . It seems to be working behind the scenes , so listen to this A3 gesture . Control is working . Second , turn up the volume for the stereo . I could go through the different menus using this , but it's not showing , I think . When did the voice commands work ? Hey , BMW , turn main screen on control . This place , which don't No , it's not . It's not right . I think we're gonna have to do is just like with a computer turned off and on again , so that's gonna involve two in the car off , turning well , get it out of locking it . This usually works and just walk away and leave it to think about itself for a bit . Vaccine .Right ? Then let's give it another go . A7 gets work .Ah , yes . Success . The screen is back with us . So I'm gonna show you this parking assistant and a little test of that . So I'm just gonna reverse up . Plus the space . Let's say I'm just driving down the road like I could be doing . So you're hunting for a parking space . What you do just hit that parking assist button on as I'm driving along the car is looking with all its senses to find a parking space . It's sensing that vehicle there sense in the space . It's measuring it to make sure the call can fit in it . Well , tell me if it can go past it . There we go . So it's come up with the peace . It knows you can park in that space . And so I just hit that to select it . And now the system is engaged on . I don't have to do anything . I don't have to select the gear . I don't have to control the throttle the break or anything . All the steering , the car does it all itself . So the test is How quickly can you get me in that space ? So I've got my mobile phone here in the time it . So here we go . 321 go up . BMW off It goes doing everything itself While I'm holding a phone which you wouldn't do when you park it shouldn't do when you're driving . So it's reversing into the space turning the wheel . Older systems just did the will . You have to do the accelerating the brakes , but this does it'll form a There you go changing gear from reverse t forward .It's quite tight space , actually . Well , let's get nice and close as well . Look at that . It should even me up . And I think that is it disengaged . So that took 37 seconds . Now I wonder if I can do the whole thing quicker myself . So let's give it a go . Here I am , Pastor Space . Let's start the clock . 321 go .Don't damage the car . What's gonna prove a point ? I definitely getting close to cutting the will . So no flange was wrong first , Actually , no , I'm coming there .Come on , Matt , Beat the system has me . Don't let me stop it . Come on . 33 seconds . So I just about be the car . That all depends on how good your a parking as to whether you want to invest in this system . But there's something else that you get is part of the package which really is worth having Another driving aid that the technology pack includes is the reversing assistant on demonstrated now using this slalom I've got laid out in front of May . So as you drive along that saying in a underground car park in your region around the pillars the car is constantly remembering your steering input on it always remembers the last 50 meters that you drive and remember . Even if you park your car up , don't come back to it for a week or two . Remember it when you put the car into reverse and you hit the reversing assistant button . The car will then play my steering in reverse so I can now do this slalom in reverse . Very easy , actually . The car Do it . Look you see on the screen as well . You see the little cones a smile of in reverse That really had me if you had to reverse out of a really tight parking space . So there we go is done as the end of the slalom in reverse . What is it much harder to do it myself ? I do like that feature and I have used it a few times .Another option 52 this car of the �1500 laser lights ? Yes , his car has frickin lasers Says so They're they're really , really good . Say the beam is about twice a strong as normal headlamps and they can shine up to 600 meters down the road . I love them when you're driving , the dog is pretty much just like you turning on the sun . And they do that thing as well where they could distribute their being pattern so they don't dazzle oncoming drivers . Brilliant . Right edition .The final option fated in this car is something vaguely calls crafted clarity . So what is it ? Well , it is glass elements for various interior bits and pieces . So you get glass here on the volume control hearings , whoever will for the I drive controller here for the stop start , but on most notably the gear selector there . It's kind of like a paperweight made out of glass . When I first saw that in the BMW X5 , I didn't really like it's in , which was a bit too chintzy . I don't mind it so much here in the A8 Siri's , because this is supposed to be the poshest , most luxurious BMW combined , so it kind of works here a bit .However , all this stuff does cost �600 so yeah , I don't like it that much . Now I've explained adoptions on this car . What wanted to do is see if you can guess the total cost of this car . So the list price plus the options we can play a game again . Don't get killed , you'll join in . Come on , click on the pop out Battle in the top right corner of the screen to guess Did this car cost �69,000 ? �78,000 . �86,000 in �94,000 you guessed ? Yeah , you did it good , right ? I can now reveal that the total value on this car was �86,000 . Congratulations . If you guess correctly , you're awesome .Finally . Finally , finally there We come to what this car is like to drive . It feels more sporty , but slightly less comfortable than something like a Mercedes s class . Q . BaiI on it feels more comfortable but less sporty . There isn't like a Porsche 9 11 In fact , it kind of occupies this space all of its own . It's quite interesting and unique .I do like it . There is one thing that's a bit odd , so this is the diesel . But if I put into sports mode when I put my foot down , it's quite a good and loud noise . It sounds almost like a V8 here on the inside , and that's because you're getting artificial engine sounds played through the cause speakers . So it sounds on the inside , but for the people on the outside they get , I don't actually like that kind of fakery . Would rather they did sound cancelling and just did in the diesel clattered . Not , though I do really like the car so far , and so far I've been getting 33 mpg , which is pretty blooming good update you on the economy later in some of the videos .In fact , why don't you tell me what videos you'd like me to do on this car with some drag race ideas I could do with it tests I could do with its , um , road trips .

42,63,X3,"This is the new BMW X3 , and it's a family friendly SUV sizzle . Very sensible , however , BMW have a reputation for being fun to drive , and that's why are often driven boy hooligans and has given the brand a bit of a bad reputation . However , it also has a reputation for producing posh feeling cars , and this is an exception .That's the reason why this new X3 starts from �39,000 . Have a three car while you can get it from just under �38,000 . So if you click on the pop out by now only below the video , you can see how much you could save on a new car .A car inside this X ray is a very nice Carter sit in . However , for May , I think the design of the XC60 is just a little bit pasha . What I can't fault , though , is the quite the material , which I do think are slightly better than in the Volvo . So everything you touch feels expensive all around the cabin . The steering will even here the materials of soft leave on the front of the glove box . You have to reach away down the door bins to find scratchy materials . And then there's a solid feeling , too . It's a look . The center console . I could I could hit it as hard as I want , and it will not budge . This thing feels absolutely solid . Then . There's nice touches as well , such as satiny feeling , switches and dials . And they're all logically laid out , like these features as well . You're from the door . You've got a little X there to remind you that you're in an ex car . Yeah , it's all very nice .Now . This particular car is known as the X Line version is the one up from the entry level . Can you get some extra satiny bits of trims and slightly larger Allah wills on these sports seats ?Which do you feel ? Quite sporty ? In fact , this car feels a little bit like a sports car that's jacked up rather than a sit on SUV . Yet there's still pie , plenty of room on adjustment in the seating positions . They'll be fine if you're big or small in this car .This particular car , the X line it's not from �41,000 but I plugged the details into Carl . Whoa , Andi , I got an offer back for 39 a half �1000 which is pretty good . I would not go for this trim level that I would step up for the M Sport .I want the main reason without other than some extra kind of bits of trim looks a bit more sporty .Still is the fact that a standard you get this lovely 10 inch wide screen entertainment screen now it's lovely . No models to get satellite navigation is standard , but this upgraded system is just even better . Easy to use . You can swipe and uses a touch screen if you want . Or my preferred method of import . Using the swivel well , bend of his I drive is brilliant . I just find it much easier to use . If you could pop out now or I'm gonna blow the video .You can see my in depth review of the entertainment system Now , could be space in here . Very good . Practical car . This x ray . So look huge door bins must involve you fit in there . Under here . There is room for a bottle . We have some Maur storage under here . So you got one is charged on this particular car . Your mobile phone doesn't work with my one plus five because my phone doesn't have it . But the cup holders a big , quite deep , shaken , even hold a flask in there . Anything I don't really like is this the silly , big phallic gear selector . Don't do that anyway .Let's move into the back seat . So once again , here in the rear , it's all very Rimi . Yeah , nice , decent me room is good headroom I can in this particular car look recline the seats if I want to . You can't get the seats that slide forwards and backwards like you can in an Audi G5 . But it's not too bad in terms of going three at once . Well , there is this humping the floor , but it's not too high on the middle . Seat isn't too much of a perch , so you could carry three abreast in the back .If you need to some other things to point out . Look at this . We've got . It's almost here . You open that you got your classic BMW Cup holders there . Come on shut . Also have this Andi , through loading , seeking carry ski's longer items and two passengers either side pop that back . Another thing is the door bins . They're huge here in the back . On couple features are like down here for the Tri Zone climate control . You actually have a digital display for those in the wrist . It's easy to set the exact temperature on Look at this . Rather having USB ports . He's got no more 12 . What socket ? But BMW gives you one of those little charges there with the USB , and he's got BMW logo on it . Just keep that myself anyway .Let's move on to the boot in terms of the capacity is exactly the same volume as an Audi Q5 , which means it's bigger than evolve . XC60 isn't all models . Get an electric tailgate a standard . Also , you just out of the way . You've got no load lips . You can slide things in and out . Dead Easy isn't in the feature I like . If I press this button here , I can remove the parcel shelf . Lift this up this on gas struts to hold it up . You got some storage into there , but I can slide this low cover neatly in here , so it's always at the way when you're not using it in the future , like is this look I wanna fall down the receipts . I can do it from here and they fold down under their own steam in a nice , big flat load area that easy to slide items all the way to the front of the car . There is also some X6 stories just here . You got some tethering points here . Slide herbal ones as well , so you can have your netting were tethering exactly where you want . It is also a 12 socket , but there , which you could use to attach electric vacuum cleaner to Hoover at the boot if you made it all dirty . Now , if you want more information on this car's practicality , click on the pop out on the link below the video .C'mon in debt video on that Now then it's time to the car .Wow A5 annoying things about this car thes part digital dollars , maybe standing , which is good . But what's not so good is that the way they've done with bits of plastic involvement ? One . They just have it . Full widescreen , high definition digital display like you get without his virtual cockpit .Unlike in some other SUV's , the doors don't extend away over the cell . So if you've been driving on a dirty road and you get out , you're gonna end up rubbing your legs on those cells and you get Mark on the back , your trousers , which is really annoying . We'll drive . Come on .More people have android phones than have apple phone . So why is it that BMW only does apple carplay with this car are not android auto ?Oh , look at these sporting events clearly designed to the airflow from over the wheel and down the side of the car . Are they real or are they not ? Use the car Stick of truth to find out the stick of truth . Say's No , they are fake now .I can't remember the last time I reviewed a car that didn't have quite adjustment on the seat belt . But this premium expensive car doesn't seem to have it .Thankfully , this car has plenty of cool features to help make up for all .This is five the optional surround view cameras on this car . Brilliant , because I can look all the way of brown death This on Is this function if I reverse which I really like so put into auto mode gonna reverse the car off Seems quite normal . But as I get closer to the obstacle knowing you get these warning blocks , then changes to a bird's eye view so you can get super super close , even auto brake . You see , you don't get the obstacle .This car hasn't acted . Grill . As you can see , the grill just shut . Then it does that when you get in on the motorway at speed . But if you're stuck in traffic and then you need some extra , according , those girls will open again to the area called the engine .Get the car with an air purification system which involves perfumes his ideal . If you've got stinky passenger , I fought it . He actually thought it . It's such a farty dog .This new X3 is about 55 kilos lighter than the old X3 , just about the same weight as a lovely producers . And that man is this by using lots of aluminium in the construction , which is actually recycled .You get the called A7 preheating .Would you operate from the digital K perfect for fruits and cold days like today .So now we've looked round the car . Let's see what it's like to drive this knee bend of the X3 is such a good all round Carter Dr . It's noticeably better than the old X3 .So , for instance , when you're driving at speed , it's quiet and you can get it with acoustic glass , so it really doesn't just keep it very silent in here . You don't get to toggle either . The only thing you notice is the diesel engine .When you put your foot down , it's a little bit on the rough side , two litre diesel . But it's probably gonna be the engine you're gonna go for . If you do moderate to large miles because it's a decent price , it's got maybe a punch 190 horsepower north , 16 8 seconds on , Bentley says . It'll do 56 months for governor and I'm averaging . I'm averaging 39 which isn't too bad . Other engines you can get include a three litre diesel , which flies and still gives good economy . Then there's a three litre turbo petrol , which will do not 60 in under five seconds . But he's a bit Thursday on . Really , if you're not do many miles spectral to go for will be just the two theater by petrol , which is pretty punchy , gives okay , regardless of which engine you go for that , you get a brilliant eight speed automatic gearbox , and it responds instantly when you want it to .When you're just cruising around , it blends those gears together seamlessly . Now all models get all wheel drive , but its rear drive bias on that Mason's car feel quite sporting drive now . It's not the bill and end all in a car such as this conference king , but it does just give this BMW on edge . So when you go down a twisty road , you could you can throw it around like it's a saloon car . It does seem to hold the road a bit better than other S8 V's . And then when it comes to comfort while this causing the adaptive dampers and they're available from �750 actually in the end sport version , they're just in the 500 you gotta have because you put the car in comfort mode and it deals with bumps very , very well put in sport if you want to , which makes a firmer and stop the car . What is so much in the corners ? But don't bother with that big waste of time . Comfort is what one of these cars is all about on in town . It helps as well , so it smoothes out the potholes , the speed hums and general to drive in town .It's pretty easy . This car visibility's okay cause you set up high , decent sized back window , extra little window at the back . The only problem I have is this bit here . It's a bit of a blind spot .

43,64,E Class,"This is the new Mercedes E class . I don't know what you're thinking .Oh , my gosh . Just like Audi must say it is is now also designing its cards with the photocopier because it looks identical to the C class and the S class . But then that's nobody thinks they are good looking cars . And anyway , photocopying can be fun , as illustrated here with my collection of artwork , which I like to call Xerox Purgatory . Now , on the inside , this is less of an upscale C class A more as though the A3 sized s class has been downsized on A4 sized e class . If you get confusing , think I'm talking about Audi is I'm actually talking about paper sizes . On the whole , it doesn't feel like the S class in here . The design with these events like this , it's very much reminiscent to the S class . And the quality just feels a cut above that of its rivals . A few words of warning This black shiny trim does scratch easily .Also , if you're buying a four cylinder car , you don't get a 12 inch screen , you get smaller . 18 screen on with Gorman satnav , which feels a little bit after market just doesn't suit this posh e class .Now you have a six in the car .You upgrade to the command system , you get this glorious big screen on . The definition is lovely . Also , you can upgrade to have digital instruments like in the S class .And it's just a looks very nice .And I like the way you can control things . Just with these touchpads is not , but it is actually touch pads there on dhe , you've still got the usual command system down there . So you got swivel wheel , you've got the touch pad , but on the whole , it's just not as easy to use as a systems you get in a BMW orn Audi , though you can get it with apple carplay , an android or tone , I suggest you use your phone rather than Mercedes-Benz system .If you want a full review of it , click in the top right hand corner of the screen on the card For more information and your belt , have another look around this car's cabin and you might be looking to respond until you anyway , coming spaces in here are really good .So plenty of places to store a war bottle On the whole , it's very spacious , so you get electric seats a standard , and you can take them back quite a long way .

And that's because they're very spacious in the back on this new one . Well , there's even more room . So got loads . Any room , lots of headroom . The seats are very comfortable there , slightly reclines . I feel nice and relaxed here now with all these cars . The middle seat isn't that great , but I think this isn't that bad at all . It's quite narrow , but it's not sat too high , so that when I sit in the middle , I've still got plenty of head room on the foot wells . A big transmission tunnel isn't too large , so you're on the whole . This is the best car in the back seats in its class Now that means it's going to continue to be the favorite with German taxi drivers .And it also helped that this car has the biggest boot in its class as well . That I don't know everything about it is great . For instance , the actual shape of the boot means that you can't fit as much stuff in as you'd like . This bit of trim is all flimsy for the , well , the cover for the false floor on Do you have to buy extra if you won't fall down rear seats , which is obscene ?On a car of this price ?You have to pay extra if you want an automated tailgate that I wouldn't bother with that .

That's more than used to get with the original Nintendo entertainment system .Reversing camera is as high definition as I've ever seen on any car , but you could probably count my freckles . You can park the car using a small fire nap or some Annette to leave its space .But well , that's all well and good . There are a few things which let this car down entry level .I see cars come with a real lead on their seats . Where is the more expensive AMG Lying cars get fake leather , though it doesn't spend thes exhaust surrounds .Actually fake . The point for the diesel engine is actually hidden under there so late .Entry level models don't come with number support standard , so you might be more comfortable travelling like this .If you wanna know wheel drive version of the diesel , you guys have to wait until 2017 .On the whole 40 is impeccable apartments , cheap plastic head it's awful , But on the way the new E class drives make up for this .Well , that depends on what you're after .

44,65,7 Series,"This is the new BMW seven series on It's a technological powerhouse .That means that I don't need to use my own iPad for some tenuous gag at the beginning of this video , because the car actually comes with its own personal tablet so you can use his tablet to control various functions within the car .Now , needless to say , this distant comes standard . You have to pay extra for it . In fact , a lot of things I'm about to show you now you do have to pay extra for on quite handsomely .We're talking thousands of pounds so hard to pull this down and I'll operate the car with this tablet . So we got some green ambient lighting there . I I think I fancy purple . So yes , look , I've changed it to purple . I can also , if I want to just put on a nice reading like just go so I can read the paper and the stocks and shares reports . I can control some other functions as well . With this , I can Actually , it's a bit sunny today . I think I want to shut out all the lights so I can close the blinds . Actually not certain at all . Is it really ? It's gonna get dark . So I could just reacting them if I want to . Something else I can do .This car has got the upgraded massage seats , and I can control that with this .And , well , there's wide range of programs there , and I think I'm gonna go for pelvic activation .Oh , well , actually , better stop that . But I'm with the rest of review now , this is the long wheel base versions of the car . You don't really need it unless you're gonna be carrying V I . P . S . Because then , well , may look at this . There's loads of knee room . Loads of headroom actually need to put this back down because I want to control the seat . I can recline this card . It feels super luxurious for a press . This button here , I can control the front passenger seat . Push it all the way forward . Obviously , you can have your CEO sat here , aren't you ? And yet , on the whole , very comfy long wheel base or even in the short wheelbase . To be fair , if you need to carry three abreast , it's doable , you know , little bit cramped on head room .

If you click it there , you can actually are full in depth practicality review For more information on that , how easy it is to spirituality in the back of the seven Siri's and just how much stuff you can fit into the boot to speak of which the boot now is it .Imagine with a car of this size , it's absolutely massive , So a saloon is never as practical as a hatchback . But this wound is a very good job because the openings nice and why the load isn't very big . So it's easy to load things in on out . It's a very flat space goes back a long way . It's widen square , and you can get it with a through loading hatch if you need to carry ski's . And on the whole , this boot is more practical than that of its rivals . I was even able to get a bike in there with its wheels off .Now there's some useful could be space in this car as well when we ran to the front while we do that we'll take a look at the design because , you know , for me , the seven series , it's a big old thing . It looks a bit like an engorged A3 . Siri's now company fought the course much here on the inside .Let me get this embargo show you that you could be spaces . They're good all round in this car , back to the desired .It's nice I like it seems very , very upmarket . The designs pretty not quite simplistic as the Mercedes s class , but I think the quality is better mean .I love this little screen here for your air conditioning system . In fact , a standard . The car gets four zone climate control . You also get stuff like Wallace charging for your phone or and heated seats .But you'd have to pay for this because this car starts from around 63 a half �1000 . The extent , well based version that's always more expensive . Andi , you can go crazy with the option you can spend like loads and loads . This thing is actually worth over �100,000 is particularly I just just bonkers . But there is loads of tech available on it .For instance , there's a new drive system on all of it , so you can control it the usual way they're using the swivel wheel , or you can actually , if you want to use it as a touch screen . So there we go through the different menus just by pressing the screen , and there's another thing I can do . I control it with gestures . So to turn up the volume on the stereo thing , I can just waggle my finger around , and it does that . So there we go now for our fall in debt video review Off the entertainment system you need to click up there on it's got a long video because there's so much to tell you about the system . It's just that impressive .But is a seven series as impressive ? When you hit the road ?You know what ? It doesn't actually feel like a normal BMW to drive . It's It's more like a Mercedes , actually part . The reason for that is that you get adaptive air suspension of standard on . You can put it into different modes , and I've got in comfort plus than it has this really nice , soft , relaxing , floaty effect . You do feel the order jolt through bigger bombs on rough surfaces . It does fidget around a bit more than the super smooth Mercedes-Benz class . You can tell they're really trying her on the side of comfort with this car . Still , you can press a few buttons and stiffened things up and even get a system which will read the road ahead using the satin out . Embrace the suspension . So your corner nice and flat . But yeah , On the whole , it does just feel a little bit different a little bit there . S8 barge like you can also great the cruise control system so the cold pretty much drive itself on . Deacon , stay you to keep you in late , so you do have to put your hands back on the wheel occasionally . Otherwise it gets cross .However , you won't get crossed cruising in the seven Siri's as it's super relaxing . Very quiet .Vengeance get to petrol or two diesel or a hybrid . The best choice for this car is a 7 30 d . This is a 7 40 d X drive with all wheel drive on over 300 horsepower , and he'll get notes . 62 miles an hour in just over five seconds , apparently will return around 52 miles per gallon . Look at the trip computer . I'm returning 40 . That's really impressive .So , too , is this automatic gearbox . It's responsive . When you wanted to be a it's smooth when he wanted to be . It's brilliant , and he can change gears yourself , using the paddles , though I wouldn't bother .What would I do have ? Is visibility good at the front of the back of a blind spot here ? But the worst is this . If I move forward , this pillar here is really thick , so any pointing out Egyptians are looking that way , you're constantly trying to pay around it . Now , if you click it there , you can see for yourself by joining me for a 360 degree passenger or video .There are some other annoying things about the BMW seven series is five .This protruding gear selector looked a little .It's stupid on phallic gesture . Controls are a bit of a gimmick , and the network all that well . Plus , you look a bit of a tall driving longer .These common core badges look a little bit now , and they're even worse when you find out they're actually not that much of the car's called is garbage . The car looks so much better with silver actions rather than this black trip , especially is after watching a motor trend video . All I see now is a hockey stick .This digital key may seem like an apple watch , but the screen is really Laghi .But there are some super cool things about this car , including what you can do with that key .You can drive the car forwards and backwards by using the remote control , which is perfect for driving into very tight parking spaces . You couldn't get off or ghost riding the wave .With virtual 360 degree cameras , you can look around the car completely . It's been like grand charisma .This You get the car with laser beam headlights , which is so bright it's like turning on the sun .You get the car with ionized air conditioning and very sense . So look , I can choose between a wolf to pure water poles or maximus of lush grasses . With the BMW Vitality program , you've effectively got a personal trainer in the car with you , so just started with the tablet .What I have to do is follow the instructions on , then press my body into the seat as directed to help build up my muscles and hopefully keep fit .So then overall , what I think of the BMW seven series , its options a hideously expensive and it looks a little bit nondescript , but it's absolutely lovely on the inside on its supremely comfy to travel in .Now , if you click up there , you get more information and find out the best deal .

45,66,E34 M5,"This is the E 34 M5 1st 1 into production back in 1988 . This actually later . 1990 version . Back in the day .It cost the equivalent of 60,000 euros , which is roughly back then �40,000 .I love the way . Open the bonnet on this car , so pull the lever . It slides forward . If you just change places , you then open it this way .Shut the gate . It's just reverse process , really get down there and then slide into place .One thing I like is that the steering wheel has no buttons on . It is just for steering . There is one . Actually , it's for the That's it . You have cruise control here on a stork , and I can move the steering wheel electrically there . It only goes in and out , no , up and down , so it actually feels quite high .You get it M5 with compound brake discs . Also these worlds Very interesting . They're known as throwing stars . The reason for that is that you can actually remove this central section , so it looks like a throwing star and there's the normal alloy behind them , and you can actually change the look of the wheels that easy .Who needs modern ? I drive when you've got fancy trip computer like this . Look , Wow . You can check your distances and see the temperature , and so you can also put in the code to immobilize your car . Also here , in the driving information , there's a special digital display which shows service information .Listen to this .One of the side of that . I just I stole it .All right , that's enough of that .This was the first M5 to get Elektronik dump control . And you can change the stiffness of the dampers using this button here between s and pay , which is probably sitting in German light sport if and huh you got this cute little war jets here to blast water and clean off the classic round headlamps ?That's just so , period .The attention to detail back here is just incredible . So the seats , lovely and comfortable . I like the central armrest . It's got , like , a ratchet system . Okay , just locks in place . It's so well made .These things like this look A3 obligatory ashtray . There's loads of them throughout this car . Your blinds there where you got an extra blind there on dhe . There's one here for the back window . Look at that .The 34 M5 , since it's part of the rear wheels for a five speed manual gearbox , it's got limited slip differential with 25% lockup on dhe exhaust . A standard is a sports exhaust is no upgrade to be had . Marketing has got a lot more cynical since this calls bill .This particular car is painted in Daytona Violet , which is part of the BMW individual catalog . Also , the car itself has always been owned by the BMW factory . It's never been owned by anyone else .The front seats are absolutely lovely , and they're fully electric . So obviously you can . So I don't forwards backwards . You can tell them as you like . You can also recline it . Andi , move ahead , rest up and down electrically . You can extend the underthe I support on dhe . It's got on memory function .This particular car has got the extended leather , so there's more leather in it than normal on just the attention to detail .The way it's even stitched ran the button for the warning lights .Wonderful .The car was initially launched with a 3.4 litre straight six with 315 horse park . We could get from North S60 in just 6.3 seconds later . Iran . It was upgraded to a 3.8 liter with 340 horsepower . And look at it is glorious . You've got a cable throttle hair . You've got individual throttle bodies . It's a thing of beauty .Let's literally go for a blast from the past . I have to tell you the same .It's very , very crisp . Redlines at 7000 rpm does encourage you to wring its neck .Body controls all right , his initial better role . But it seems to grip on very , very well , and it has that 90 slightly floaty feel to it . Way still lets you know exactly what that's from .Will's are doing . What a treat this is cocky grin off your face .That's one thing you definitely notice compared to a modern turbocharge car . If you choose the wrong gear on cock up your corner . Yeah , it's gonna affect how fast you go .What an amazing car . Let's have a little go up and see what it's like accelerating in first . So that's 100 Came h there . Oh , lovely .

46,67,C 63 AMG,"This is the Mercedes C 63 AMG coupe . A normal review . Press cars . However , this one actually belongs to the founder and CEO of cargo , Mr James Hind . And there's a picture of Angel happy with his new car . Now , James has only just bought this car . So I've pledged on pain of death to take great care of his new baby .I've promised I won't drive it very quickly at all on . Of course , I told him that our treat his car with the same respect I would my own car .And with that in mind , here is the most to date review of the name Jean . Keep A8 you're ever gonna see . This is the range topping edition one version of the C 63 AMG .Keep a that means as well as the usual AMG beefed up bodywork , frippery and sporty cabin features . It has an extra inch on its rear wheels , some gloss black detail ng and a huge stripe running the length of the car like some giant German scum on this car goes like stink .So under the body off guy four litre twin turbo V8 on as this is this model , it's got 510 horsepower . It drives the rear wheels by a very slick seven speed automatic gearbox with paddle shifters on dhe . A limited slip differential for really good traction . No , that means she'll be out to do naught to 62 miles an hour in just 3.9 seconds if you use launch control . However , for each car test , I first need to learn the procedure . It's easy and some cars than in others . To find out how the C 63 bears are gonna have a race against a human , no human that , unlike the car , is built for comfort rather than speed . So what's gonna happen is when the start starts to race , the one is going to go , and I'm gonna pick up the money . I'm gonna figure out how to engage launch control and engage it , and they're gonna launch . I'm gonna race the runner and see if I can beat them to that cone . That's what happens .Here we go get the manual are known this car launches called race starts . So where is it ? In the index ? Come on , come on .Okay . Put the car into sports mode . Sportsmost engaging put it into drive from the brakes on the brake . Pull both paddles up together , right pedal to confirm . Yes , I do . Wanna race start floating froth ?Is there good night blubber that that was close ? Fortunately , the car managed to beat the human . Actually , once you've learned the launch control system , it's a quick to engage so long as the cars in anything other than comfort .As for the time , let's see , that's 4.6 seconds . Not bad , considering the track . It's slippery on . The C 63 has a tendency to light up the tires , so this engine produces 700 new two meters of torque . And put that into perspective for you . That's more pulling power than you get from a Ferrari F 12 . And the best thing is is that it's available from under 2000 rpm . So you put your foot down . I think it just takes off , and it makes a sound of an old fucker . I'm talking about the World War two airplane .The saddle , huh ?If you turn the C 60 three's electronic stability , control off the car turns into an absolute good .James wrote my men returning his car with a little less rubber on its tires .For me , the tribute to this car is that while it's as wild as a wolf , it can also be is controllable as a sheep dog . If you put the car into sports handling mode , it gives you a little bit of tail slip if you want it . But we'll safely gather you up before you get past the point of no return . That's brilliant if you want to feel like a driving God , but you don't actually exposed eventually as a false prophet . As you end up backwards in a ditch , the only real lead down to the whole experience is perhaps the steering . Yes , it works . But unlike in some other performance cars , it doesn't make you feel the road . And so it's a bit like trying to re Braille while wearing oven gloves . Still , you don't always want to feel things , do you ? And as your cycle this car through its various driving modes , going from race to sport plus two sport and then to comfort , you can fill it gently , lower its guard and just become a little bit more chilled out as the throttle response softens and deductive suspension just relaxes , and it becomes more comfortable on even the exhaust . Know it becomes quieter as you go through those stages . And , yeah , then it's a reasonably comfy Carter just fool around it .Then you're left with a normal Mercedes-Benz Cooper .That means a comfy cruiser with a high class cabin , which feels top notch .The only let down is the entertainment system , which isn't as good as that in the BMW S4 BMW is better for carrying rear passengers , too .But then , that's not the point of a coup bay , now is it ?Your mates , Mon Lake and bloody well , get out walk because , after all , this thing is anything but a cheap ride .For starters , this is an expensive car to run so Mercedes-Benz it should be capable of 33 months for Galan . But since he's owned it , James has only averaged 21 Mars began , and he drives a lot more sedate Lee than I have been today .And then there's the price . XC60 three keep a starts from �62,000 but if you click on the popular band , you can save around five grand on one card co dot uk . That's exactly what James did .I just hope he doesn't watch this review and see how badly I treated his car . There was . This is gonna be my last video for girls , Actually , probably on the car . He enjoyed this video , plays like it and share it on our logo to subscribe on on the video windows to watch our AMG mega drag race on full in depth review of the Mercedes C Class coupe A8 ."
47,68,250e,"hello . Welcome to another episode of fully charged . This episode is all about the Mercedes to 50 e , which is the car I'm driving now , and I've driven for almost half a kilometer in it . So I'm doing that thing I often do when I get in the car and start driving it and then start talking about it . And I know nothing about it , but one of the things that is fascinating about this car that's got nothing to do with the technology or the build quality or the fact that it's purely electric car , which this one is 100% electric car . No petrol engine is not a plug in hybrid , but one of the mysterious things is that it's sort of secret . It's like Mercedes of built this electric car we don't want anyone to know on . They're not that keen . Thio Advertise it . Here's a first impression off what it's like to drive . Obviously , I'm a sucker for this stuff . Regular viewers will know . I'm easily impressed . I would kill . Call this a high end electric car . It is very nicely put together . It is very solid feeling a very easy car to get control of the visibility is fantastic .The mirrors are really good . The rear view is excellent . Controls are very intuitive . As soon as you see the dashboard , you know exactly what you're looking at .A ll . That stuff is really good . I'm not . There's no you can't sort of go . Oh , it's it's Mercedes-Benz colleges never up too much . No , They're really , really good making really good cars . Everybody knows that this is a really good cars now . They had a long and complicated and , I think , varied relationship with Tessler , and they still clearly supply components to Tesler . And I think Tessa Audi quite a lot of work with them on their electric drive trains on that shows on this car .So here's the basic stats for the car it has a 28 kilowatt hour battery has , ah , electric motor with 340 Newton meters of talk , which means it's quite powerful .It is a cup , very comfortable five seater interior .It has an official stated range of a run over by a 120 miles . The lovely man who's let me this car , Andy said he thinks 85 to 90 years of realistic like every day , driving range in rain in the cold and wet with pills , which seems very , very plausible . But here's one of the things that I know will garner some comments and some annoyance because it is a brilliant car . It has no rapid charge ability , so this car could be charged on a 13 and plug you have in your kitchen . Or it can use a wall mounted car charger , but only up to 60 nap . So it's only a three kilowatt charger , a three killer or five charges , so it takes at the minimum 4 to 5 hours to charge it . So if you're going to stop it , a motorway service is plug it into a rapid charger . The only charge you can use is the really slow one . So you're gonna be waiting three or four hours toe . Add 18 90% to the battery . Which is which means it's just crazy on what Andy , the owner of this car said , is that he just doesn't He's not gonna go on long journeys in it . He can't because he can't be bothered to wait that long to recharge the car . That is a really I'd say that was a really drawback of this vehicle because everything else about it is really nice , and it's really hard to know his . I think his reasoning is quite , quite sensible , why they didn't put a rapid charge socket on it . And that is because the cut this car you can also get is a diesel version or a petrol version .And they haven't changed anything about the exterior on this car and the actual refueling socket for the fossil burning version eyes specific size . They haven't even changed that . So the only they haven't got room to put in . For instance , a Chatham Oh Charger or on a C charger , which is a slightly bigger connector . They haven't got the space in it , which you just think . Well , that's baffling , because it can't be that complicated to engineer that into a car .But that seems to be the only reason because , you know , in every other respect , this car is above average for the for the range of vehicles that are equivalent to this , you know , electric rivers with around 100 mile range .I think this is very nice car , you know , this is a proper , posh Mercedes . It's no Renno Zoe And I love the Reynolds . Oh , don't get me wrong .But you know , the Renzo is I love it because of its simplicity and its base sickness of its design . And this has got a lot of very Germanic silver and black fittings and all kinds of stuff like that .I'm gonna try . I'm trying . I just put it in sport . Now I'm just going through all the various things it can do That's interesting . Similar straits to sport . It went from 82 miles range to 73 . So , clearly sport is a lot more responsive . It gives you maximum and it doesn't do a lot of regionals . I'll go back to ICO , plus more region .So it has all those things and you get used to those things very quickly . Need learn which ones you want to do . But what you would never get used to is the fact that you can't wrap it . Charge it all cars . Now I'm gonna big up the rain Ozone . Now you can wrap it . Charge the rain . Oh , Zoe , People Dr John O'Groats in the rhinos . Oh , they drive all over the country and it's not like it's a new thing anymore . You know , Chad Ammo's almost a decade old . All the other charging systems that come out that used by Volkswagen , that used by BMW . You know , all of those cars have rapid charges . I can't think of the last pure electric car a winning that doesn't have a rapid charge . In fact , I've never been in one that doesn't have a robbery charge . They all do . So why have Mercedes-Benz that choice ? That's something . I don't know how I can find out Aiken , my e mail them . And if they respond to me , they've never responded to me before .The deals you can get on this car are unbelievable . This is not unexpected car . I'm not gonna put prices up because they there isn't any point , because the price that you might find listed isn't what you'd pay for it . If you want one of these cars , go to Mercedes-Benz ship and say I want one of those cars , they will say , Oh , now have the diesel version have the petrol version , but eventually , if you can get one , you get it very , very cheaply , very cheaply . So there's no there's no point saying how much it costs because I don't know . And I think that I'm not the reliable person , as we've discovered many times about . My guys have been criticized for not saying how much the Tessler Power War cost or for not saying how much the conversion on the Volkswagen Electric . But that's because there's so many variables . So it's probably from this car is from �20,000 . But I reckon you get it . I think you get it for less . Maybe you've seen I have never seen an advert for this car , like in a newspaper , on a Web page or anything like that . I've never seen . I've never heard people talking about it . This is the only one I've ever found , and this is really through a regular , fully charged viewer .We got in touch with me , who's a Patriot supporters , amazing guy and a very nice man , and he said , I'll come and have a go in mind , which is really generous off him , and I really appreciate it . I'm being very careful , Andy , not to scratch it or run into anything . I'm just having a really a brief test drive just to see what it's like just ahead get a feel of it because I couldn't do it in any other way . I couldn't like I would do normally with other vehicles . Get in touch with the manufacturer . They lend you a car for a week or whatever , so you can have a test drive it . I don't know whether I can do that with Mercedes . Maybe they'll be nice to me after they see this . I'm not shaking the car off . I think it's great . Why isn't it got rapid charging ? That's what I want to know . Riel . Real mystery . Ah , there we go .Okay , so I'm just learning how this car does its subtleties . We're going down a hill . What I'm feeling now is the region is that I would say half break half region when you're at that speed . Regionalism . Impressive . Don't think it's got adaptive region . I don't I don't believe there's any other . Oh , I say that I can put more regional with the paddles on the steering wheels . I love that . That is brilliant . That really makes a difference . If I do that , it takes it off . Oh , hello . When I do that and it puts it on our why can't all electric cars have that . That little bit of extra control over your region is just magical . That is , that is brilliant . The only other car I've ever experienced that has that is the Mitsubishi Outlander that had a very similar system . That is just genius . Because you're particularly if you're going down a long hill , you can control the speed purely by re generating electricity into the battery , you can turn up and down and up and down . It's such an obvious thing to have on electric cars all manufacturers please , please in your next model . Make sure you have that . So now no re genital . Maximum . Brilliant . Brilliant . So I'm controlling the speed of the car purely by . That is fantastic . Just I'm working out all right . I'm working out safely . Indicate it's so automatic for me because it is exactly the same as the Tessler .Sorry to keep going on about that . So for locals who live in the Star Bridge Kidderminster Redditch area , we're going up Chapel Lane towards Clint . I've never been to Clint in my life .Very pretty , Randy , Lovely hills and stuff . Well , now we got a nice downhill or I've got maximum region or that's a nice eyes and I can let it off bizarrely . If you're going down a hill , you let off the region . It's not bizarre . You start going faster . I'm actually driving with region . Only I haven't touched . The brakes went down quite a steep hill . Have not to touch the brakes . That is lovely .Wow , that is It doesn't make up for the fact that there's no rapid charging , but a boy just so frustrated because this is a brilliant car and it's restricted in its usefulness by that simple thing , because that technology that the car requires tohave to be rapid charge enabled is is not that expensive anymore .When it was first introduced , it was still , you know , developing technology is now mass produced that stuffs mass produced Mercedes . Daimler Benz could by loads of them . They could buy them from this , and they could buy them Renno . If they don't make them themselves , you know you could get them .I just want to drive this car from across the country .It's really , really comfortable Car to drive Really easy counter drive all the turning circle . Oh , hello . Oh , that is fantastic . If you're used to driving . I've said it too many times . The Tessler that is such a delight .It turns really tight way pedestrian warning sound . It's quite mournful , quite a sad noise . It sounds like a mummy whale that's lost her baby whale in the sea .So it is a peculiar car . This , it is , is mysterious that of all the things that not have rapid charging is kind of one of the essential ones , you know .The other thing that's quite spooky is it has a key . I all cars , every key . But normally you just have it with you in the car starts this one . You have to put it in a little hole like an old fashioned key , and you put it in and you turn it . But then you have to do the like what , like used to an old fashioned cars where you have to kind of turn it all the way there that turns it on . It's on now , but that's very peculiar . Don't have to do that . I mean , I'm not just talking , so Tesla's I'm talking everything of driven . You just have the key with you . Don't put a key in . That's quite peculiar .So I'm I'm really I've got really mixed feelings about it because there's no question this is a really highly finessed vehicle . It's really nicely finished . It's really nice to drive . It's got , I would think very good , very decent range just means that , you know , you go on a motorway , you think , Oh , I'm going to stop here . I can plug it in and using the things like rapid charges . You can use the the ordinary 80 charger , but it takes three and 1/2 hours to fill it . So you're going , What are we gonna do ? For three and 1/2 hours ? I've had I've had my coffee . I've had a week just , you know , it's just that doesn't work . And that's all the criticisms of electric cars from five and 10 years ago . We don't take too long to charge . This one takes too long to charge at home . It's fine . Doesn't matter there . But when you're on the motorway or something you wanted to do anyway , other than that it's it's brilliant . It's , you know , it's very , very good . I really like it . So that's all that's all for this . This episode of fully charged you know I'm not gonna be too boring about it . But I just mentioned Patriot subscribe . You know , if you want to And if you have been , of course . Thank you for watching ."
48,69,C 63 AMG,"I'm in the new Mercedes AMG C 63 s .Now it's got a hand built four litre twin turbo V8 with 510 horsepower , and it's possible to do naught to 60 in four seconds . So I'm gonna find out if it really can . My specialist timing gear up here got the car and it's racist settings . I'm just gonna launch it .That was over like that . No . 26 day , four seconds dead . Let's say we'll do it again .Yeah , let's have a look once again . Four seconds dead , right ? The state one last time .I'll do it . It's all day long , actually . Actually , this time it's done it in 3.9 seconds . This car is fast , But then I guess you knew that now then , if you know .But we've got Refer Friends game . So if you click on the pop out back in the top right hand corner the screen , you can see how you could earn a �50 Amazon gift card . If you prefer a friend to call while on a bar crawl through us .Okay , then let's start this review by talking about this car's design . So the big change over the previous C 63 is the new AMG Grill sensitive horizontal slats . You've got vertical ones , and it's just like that on the AMG GT-R . But do you prefer this new grill ? Click on the pop out , banning that some rank on the screen to let me know if you prefer this one or the old one . Now , over the normal C Class , you've got a deeper from bumper . Then it's slightly different in terms of its design to the old C 63 . Angie's got some slaps here , for instance , to help the airflow into the radiators . There's also some new wheel designs as well .You can get them in 18 or 19 years . These are the Nineteens , and they've been specifically designed in a wind tunnel toe A8 aerodynamics . This car's got the optional carbon ceramic brakes . It's also got the full multi beam led headlights , which is a nice touch on being XC60 .Three . You've got slightly wider wheel arch than on the normal C class until it you know what the bullet . Of course , look , be A8 bi turbo on the front wings . There you got some side skirts and obviously the cost . It's low to the ground . This one , you might notice , has carbon wing mirrors has got a common pack on it , obviously , an upgrade moving to the rear of the car . It's a more common here with this little booklets . Boy , let's kind of discreet , but it looks . Looks like carbon , doesn't it ? And then the rear diffuser of this latest C six trees a bit different on deeper than the previous generation , and so it's a bit more noticeable , and you've got some started redesigned exhaust pipes as well . Inside , there's some notable changes over the previous C 63 . For instance , you now get this new AMG steering wheel , which is designed to be more grippy and nicer to holding . It does feel pretty nice to hold .It also comes with controls for the entertainment system , which means you onto the new largest central screen . There on dhe , a new digital drivers display , both of which is standard with a digital drivers display .You conflict through various different mo's change the views , and there's lots of information that you can see that very nice .I like it also , the fact that Mercedes has given these sports seats adjustable side bolsters , which help keep you in place when you're cornering quickly , which you will be trying to do in this car .Other than that , though , yeah , it's pretty much like the previous C 63 inside , which means that the quality is good and it's got quite a stolen attitude . Maybe that's classy as an Audi RS4 interior , but it's definitely more modern feeling than a BMW .M3 Sze does the pricing well , S8 isn't confirmed yet , but the cars like to stop from around �63,000 for the normalcy 63 rising to �73,000 for this C 63 s version . But if you could pop out there in the top right hand corner the screen , you can see how much you can save one of these cars or any new call , for that matter , Carlo .Now then it's time for the car . Wow , A5 annoying things about this car on European versions of the C 63 a .M . J . You can choose whether you want another U S B port , their mobile devices or 12 on sock It to you . No , in the UK , though , you can only ever have a 12 what socket there or the USB stuff is contained into the central arm .Rest a lot , This blue paint . Of course you do . Well , you have to pay extra for it . In fact , unless you want the car in polar white , you have to pay extra for any other color paint scheme .This is a very expensive car .And yes , it's dated . However , the entertainment system that you get in it isn't actually the very latest one from the Sadie , so the one in the A class is actually better .Headroom is a little bit tied in the back of the Mercedes C class in this C 63 version .Taller people end up kind of slamming the head back against their light when he accelerates , and then they give him a bit of a headache and also miss of the hair styles here with a left hand drive car , the steering wheel is perfectly placed central to your body , but in the right hand drive cars , the C class is single is slightly offset to the left , so you can feel a bit twisted behind the wheel if you're British .Thankfully , this car has plenty of call features to help make up for all this is five .Both versions of the C 63 now come as standard with an electrically controlled , that limited slip differential on that can actually decide how much power to send to eat to the rear wheels for maximum corn exiting grip .Another thing that standard on this car is adaptive suspension , and you can choose between a comfort mode sports mode race mode on light with a BMW on Audi .You don't have to pay extra for a performance exhaust within its quite mode . It sounds like this .Then , at the press of a button you can put into sports mode , then it sounds like this .I think I prefer like that . Don't you see ? 63 s comes with dynamic engine mounts , and they can either loosen or tighten their grip on the engine . Either improve comfort or better balance .You can get this car with some new steering wheel mounted controls , and they're really cool . For instance , on the right , I can use to choose a different driving modes from slippery individual comfort , sport , sport plus and race . Now the one on the other side . Aiken cycle through different menus and I can use it to toggle between the different eggs or settings , the suspense and settings and then moved back . If I want to turn off the stability control and when I do that , I can use this other dial toe . Alter the intervention from the traction control . If I want , I can have it all the way off for massive tail slides .You look like a complete plonker down on with this helmet on . But it's the rules of this track . So have to bear with me today what doesn't work .Well , with this seat , I'm gonna end up with this massive hunchback of us . Stay in this car too long like this as a compliment . Head back .So out on this technical track bill Stubborn Germany . This is a heavy car .It was a good job around here . I am thankful of those carbon ceramic brakes because there's lots of breaking from high speed on this circuit . It's very technical . The still breaks cord runner talent after a while .Yeah , this is pointing . It's fun , You know about the car . With its systems in race , I also have the stability control in sport handling . It gives me a bit of slip , but it's there to gather me up if I get things badly wrong . What I can do , though , is put it off by pressing the button down here . Now it's off now . What I can do , though , is turn the dial to alter the amount of traction control I have from quite a lot to Not at all . I know . I'm probably gonna go for no help it'll we'll see what happens . Hopefully , it's all gonna go badly wrong for May . Let's have a look . Look , this is quite good Corner . Let's try this .Oh , yes , Oh , yeah , This guy's an absolute basis . You'd expect A7 AMG . Nothing's changed . Their fact is , though , right ? No one's gonna be driving that car like this is a treat for journalists .And we spent so much time on track going on how great cars are driven them on track and we get to burn through tires without having to pay for them . And it's no a realistic idea of what the cars like , So yet they're gonna lose his helmet loser track and get out on the road .So this is more like it . I can find it a realistic test of this car because being on track , it sort of hides its performance a bit . Obviously , you've got speed limit on this run off . You get things wrong . Where's here ? Yeah , there's no burn off , just trees the other road users on . Of course , if I get too quickly , I could end up in prison .So I've got all this car settings kind of dull backs that the suspension is softer . They always still feels a little bit on the firm side , then the gearbox . It's in its automatic mode speaking , which is actually a new nine speed automatic gearbox . S8 says It could shift gets faster than the old seven speed in the previous C 63 . And yes , it seems to shift is pretty quickly . It still has a wet clutch rather than a normal talk converter . So you can do all that control stuff like a shady earlier . It feels more relaxing . I've told it back , but still , you know this is a beast of a car . You can always hear the engine rumbling away , say fill the suspension is a little bit of the firm side out . Control on the steering wheel remind you this is a sport vehicle , as does the raw , the firm sport seats within Audi RS4 . You could just driving along on Forget you in a performance car . It's just like any other A4 until you put your foot down that it comes alive . Where is this ? It never fully relaxes . You can always tell it's ready to pounce . I mean , that's just the AMG way .You can actually compare this car and its rivals to the big cats so that BMW M3 would be like a cheater . It's the lightest . It's the most agile , the Audi RS4 . It will be a leopard . It's this stealthy ist . And of course , it's got that extra grip so they could climb trees .This , though , this is quite clearly a lion because it's the most powerful on dhe . It's got the loudest roar that way . One reason to have this car alone is for the autumn V8 engine . It's still the car's standout feature .Hey guys , how would you like an Amazon gift card worth �50 ?

49,70,C 350e ,"welcome to fully charge . Now this show is really special because I'm in a Mercedes now . This is the first time I have ever driven a Mercedes . Always have been in Mercedes-Benz usually sat in the back while someone drives me to a TV studio Summit . Mercedes Z8 . But I've never driven a Mercedes in my life , and this one is obviously really Brother Pasha . One . This is the Mercedes C 3 50 e 2017 model .It's not even out yet . You can't even see this car . That's how cool is now . Here's an interesting little fact that he's got really nothing to do with a car , but it has got a little bit to do with the attempt a house to put it . The Mercedes PR department and I've been trying to get in touch with us for a long time because they're doing a lot of electric and plug in hybrid cars on . I'd love to test drive them for fully charged . I've never been able to get any responses of them . I mentioned this to a friend of a friend , and we're gonna drive off now . There we go on , and I got a message back from a very , very nice man called Phil who ? Who owns this car . And he said , Why don't you come and test drive mine ? So instead of getting a , uh , Mercedes-Benz Mercedes , I've got a Mercedes from Phil .So it has , I think , from what I can tell about a 25 mile range on the batteries , if you just drive it on pure electric mode on Dhe , then But you can also drive in a sort of varying states of hybrid modes , like a hybrid car so that the battery comes in and then goes off again . And then the petrol engine comes in . So you're getting higher mpg , Uh , and then you can also have it in sport mode on . Then you haven't in sport mode plus , which apparently is quite impressive . So it is a two litre petrol engine , I think , a turbocharged two litre petrol engine and an electric motor .One of the interesting things is the all the stocks on the steering column are extremely familiar to me , as in they are exactly the same ones on a Tesla model s . So these levers here on the steering wheel wipers , cruise control gear shift arrangement , that's exactly are the same ones that Tesla has . Mercedes-Benz . You have to forgive me because I'm literally I've got in the car with rigged up cameras . I got in the car , satin it started it , drove it . That's it . That's interesting .So he's driven 1000 and 47 miles on on electric mode . Since he's had the car , he's driven 3000 miles in the car , said , That gives you a clue of how much you do in the in the electro mode .That's impressive , anyway . So it's a Mercedes is beautifully , clearly beautifully engineered , its X3 the absolute pinnacle of German engineering prowess . The steering is exquisite vision out of the car , that rear view mirrors .All that stuff is you just go card when you get it right in the car . This is what it looks like .As you can tell . It's incredibly quiet .I will try the various different mode , so I'm gonna go into that now . This is E save mode . E Save mode means that the engine should be running .There's the engine running Okay , Yeah , that's quite fast .But what that's doing is it's saving the battery until you get to your destination , But even then , now the engines off now because he didn't need it . But I wasn't pushing it . Okay , so now we'll go to another one . That charge that will charge the battery . So that means the engine is running constantly while you're driving and it's charging the battery and you could feel actually , it's working harder . I can sense that it's going thio because it's Judge and it's still running now . So even though we're going down a hill , the engine's still running . So now I'm gonna try . This is hybrid motor . Now we're going down a hill , so the engine isn't running it all because obviously it doesn't need to .The electric motor is now region ing power back into the batteries because obviously , if you've got a Mercedes , then you're probably into driving on you like the control that you have over your driving experience . In fact , you want to driving experience . So if you put it in sport mode , right , you've now got control over the gears . So that was in quite a low gigs . I was going down a slight hill . So if I do that now , I'm in third . I'm in second .Yes , Okay , It does have quite a bit of George , but there's one more that sport plus . Okay , now it's now got a lot of extra things have come on the dashboard basically telling me , Just don't do it .I'm now back into electric .What's interesting is I've been in this car for a love five minutes driving it . I've been shown where the buttons are once , and I'm just finding them . I don't take my eyes off the road . I find all the various modes by field . I'm not looking over a screen in touching a screen , like in a Tesla . Okay , they don't like buttons at Tessler . But , you know , every now and then there's something to be said for a bit of a button , so I should explain where we are .We're down there extra in Devon , and it's gorgeous . My dry going for a lovely drive in through the countryside .Ah , I Didi save . No , Come back . I want the mood there . No e mode . Can I just take back what I said about touch screens ? They're really good .I actually what's weird about this ? My first time driving in Mercedes , I actually feel like quite a good driver , John , don't normally feel really in control of the car . That's the beauty of it .What this does , of course , is all , as always , is people who drive a plug in hybrid , then go off my next card , the electric , because it works and I can use it , and I understand how it works . Fill the owner of this car plugs current hope just on ordinary three pin plug .So there's a couple of other things I'm learning about this car one . I really like driving it , too .I wish it was 100% electric like that in this and leaf that's going the other way . You know , it just feels like it should be an electric car , cause it's just a brilliant electrical . When is one ? But it's got some amazing technology . The throttle , the accelerator , the go faster pedal has haptic feedback . So if you push it too far , so I'm like pushing it to where it's gonna come out of hybrid mode and go into got electric motor goingto use the petrol engine . You get a little cliques doesn't stop me doing it . But do you get this feeling on your foot like you're like it's got a bit of like . Some phones have haptic feedback on the buttons , and some computers do . It sounds like this . Very grandiose . It's just a little vibration . So you're getting this feedback when you're trying to do an economic dr on the feedback in the in the throttle is coming from the SAT navs knowledge of the route .Andi . It's trying to make sure that you get the maximum fuel economy for the route you're using . So the haptic feedback is telling you a ease off . The throttle of it on the way that information comes is from the satnav . So you put a destination on the satnav . It knows the route . It knows the hills , the dips out . There we go . The engine just kicked in . Then it just reminds you basically , So it's sort of dr of Feedback , but it's a new form of Dr A3 back of never , never experienced . When it first did , I was worried that I'd broken the throttle , that something had snapped because it felt a bit wigs . It went like that . It gives you a little kick in the foot .There's no other way of describing it , but someone who isn't a professional cower reviewer driving a really awesome Lee decked out , high tech Mercedes for the first time , going . Wow ! It's doing all sorts of really , really clever things , and I'm not quite sure what they are is that moment .I haven't got cruise control on , but the car's just sort of driving itself . She's quite alarming .So at the moment I'm doing 99.9 miles to the gallon , which is completely unrealistic because we've been going downhill in hybrid mode there what ? Phyllis told me his he averages over . He does a lot of very long motorway drives he's averaging . His overall consumption is about 60 65 miles to the gallon , which in a car off this size and potential performance is , you know , is better than your average Mercedes-Benz a law Petra , which would be which would get 25 to 30 miles ago . And now , of course , I like saying that because then I'll get hundreds of comments from Mercedes-Benz , who will swear blind that their diesel Mercedes get 85 miles to the gallon . But you know what ? I don't believe that someone's gotta work out a better way off . Measuring how many kilometers you due to a liter ? Because that doesn't work . Saying so many liters per 100 kilometers is too boring and longer what I want . I want the same as MPG . Can someone work it out , please ? Because I got love criticisms . What I'm talking about now is what I'm seeing here . Which is , it says in the car . 99.9 m p . G . Miles per gallon . I'm quite like KP something kilometers per liter . So someone killed my family college in doing so .The Mercedes C 3 50 e Sport Here are some actual stats directly from Mercedes is �38,845 .But as we all know , that's a suggested price . The car is available to lease for around �250 a month .It's a five seat , four door plug in hybrid with a luggage capacity of 335I litres .See 3 50 e can travel 19 miles on a full battery . The battery has a 6.5 kilowatt hour capacity . It has a top speed of 155 miles an hour , or 250 kilometres . An hour on can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles an hour in 5.9 seconds . It is powered by two litre , four cylinder petrol . Engine on has an electric motor with a combined output of 215 kilowatts , or 293 brake horsepower on E350 Newton meters of torque . According to Mercedes , It has an extra urban . I think that means outside of a town fuel efficiency of 61 mpg or 25.9 kilometers per liter . See , that's not so hard to work out , is it ? On ? It produces 48 grams of CO two kilometer .Well , now that I've got stuck in a traffic jam just outside Exeter , I think this is a good time to wind up this episode .I've had enormous fun driving this car today has been really a pleasure .I'd like to thank Phil for letting me borrow his car . And I'd also like to thank Mercedes-Benz . I'm not gonna say thank Mercedes-Benz , fully charged by lending me their latest battery and plug in hybrid and electric vehicles . Maybe one day I will maybe they'll see this and they'll go all right , let him have one , then for a couple of days , because that's the trouble with a very short drive .It , particularly in a plug in hybrid tea , kind of actually get a realistic view of what you're realistic Mileage would be is very difficult . I mean , it's still telling me 99.9 mpg , so you know that I know that isn't very realistic .But anyway , I've really enjoyed driving . It has been amazing . Car to drive .It's a real privilege to work for my first ever Mercedes-Benz driven to be basically an electric car , pretty much even though it's got an engine in front .That's all we've got time for . Please subscribe . You know the normal things . Please describe . Please have a look at the Patriarch Page . If you want to support us $2 a month , $2 a month , that's all . There's not much really makes a big difference to us on dhe . Of course , as always , if you have been , thank you for watching"
50,71,EQC,"there's a car company who you might be familiar with called Mercedes-Benz , and they actually invented the car , So they've been around awhile . At the moment , the only Mercedes-Benz A5 that's pure electric is actually not really Mercedes-Benz a smart and it's called a needy , But it's about to become the smart e que because E . Q is the name of the sub brand that Mercedes is creating for all of its battery electric vehicles . From now on in 2019 their first completely dedicated ground up evey is gonna be born . And the reason why I'm walking along a lonely road in the Black forest in Germany because I'm about to travel in that car , a pre production of that car that's going to go on sale in 2019 and it's called the Q C . We don't exactly know what this car is . This car . It's going to go on sale next year on the underpinnings of this are going to underpin four Mercedes-Benz e . Q . See the e Q E v e que es on the each , you A . You can see there's a partner curry . Is this exciting ? Yes , because Mercedes is spending eight and 1/2 �1,000,000,000 on their e que Siri's We just got in the You see , I'm with chief engineer Michael Kilts . Michael , you are You developed quite a few Mercedes-Benz . Yeah , that's right . From my responsibility to the area , I've also Z8 class . See , Ellis was last one . Yes , One of my favorites like this is a very different game for you than if you felt you had to learn a lot of different skills . The evidence she has . And it's a great time to be in such a program because you have a lot of opportunities . Yeah , appears to combustion engine car . So finally , for me , that's a great thing . Yeah , I mean , it's it's a completely different platform . And , of course , we're in the E Q C , which is a pre production car .Which is why it's good . All these crazy lumps and bumps and patterns to disguise the exterior . And inside , we've got lots of fabric covering up what the dashboard looks like on what the controls look like . You got a lovely piece of felt over the Mercedes badge here .How long have you been developing this car ? That's the first question . Yeah , nearly three years Now what about three years ? A lot of bench testing yet . So , being one test binge you now we are in the main driving face , actually , so we have a build about 90 cars to know 90 of 90 . Well , it's it's going on sale next year . So that's that's quite soon , I suppose . On behind me , I have hiding . I have Wolf going off . You're the spokesperson for E Q . Right on this . The Q C is going to be is the first on the all new dedicated vory V . Isn't it because we've had the B class electric before ?Which , obviously , based on the B class petrol diesel combustion car on the smart E D , which is based upon a smart but nothing else , the right actually really good ignoring a mg Mercedes-Benz cause , you know , their luxury cars have always been smooth and quiet , and the focus on refinement and comfort isn't so . That's perfect for the electric drive sister . Absolutely so I'll be going is to be as quiet as possible . You should not hear anything from the drive train , so you might have already heard when you when you when you put your foot down hard . I just had a little bit of a whistle and that was it .And this will also way . Get rid of this . You're gonna get rid of those there . You g you want total silence . This is a specific noise that it's coming from the border Come forward if he is electric one . Yeah . So finally we get to get rid of this one .That's quick .That is quick .This car is related to the generation Q7 from 2016 right ? It's Q5 Paris 26 . Yes . And that concept was an SUV with an interesting front end .That's obviously doesn't need a radiator grille has two electric motors , one of the front one in Syria .Okay , I want to go to sports mode that I want to have some more . Great on the Rio . Yes . So , in the end , discussing a lot of opportunities that you regularly have you fare on the developing .This car so far has made combustion cars seem very old fashioned . Well , no , I think commercial car is is completely different . Yes . Oh , and we're used to the combustion car , No doubt . Hey , fund .You have high acceleration was No . No . Yeah , Yes . Oh , really say OK , sports car you used to . He's getting more . You have a rev counter . You have to go up here . Yeah , I think it's just dig Z8 like hell . It does go like help in terms of performance is going like So you have even handling on that road , isn't it was it was quite good . So yeah , that's of course , this is quite high .This is a big car . What size is it compared to an existing Mercedes-Benz it like the heat ?Nance sporting . This should be like a seal S8 . Finally , there's also no doubt . Yeah , so it's gonna be done . So it's pretty easy because even here , it's pretty steep . It is on the road are quite bad .Still in terms of performance are we talking like a sub five seconds to 62 ? It will be about so five seconds . S8 might do you good . Good number . I mean , they haven't finalized this because we did not any acidification or final testing because we are still in tuning seriously . Software ? Yes . So finally , we will see about that . And if Mercedes-Benz decided to make everything in house , the motor is not been effected by messages about the battery and everything else is meaning . Mercedes-Benz is there in the battery is coming from comments so far .More dough , Giacomo . Okay , Miss Sadie seemed to be going for a more for a familiar look to their electric cars . They're not going all out crazy design . It should feel and look like Mercedes-Benz out . Yeah , but still , the whole body is completing you because some brands have gone . Have decided to go , You know , BMW with the eye Siri's . It's quite radical compared to A3 Siri's G5 serial , the regular Siri's . But I can see I can see the logic of Mercedes going well . Actually , let's just let's not scare people . We found a nice , quiet area . You can pull off the mayor and just have a quick look . I mean , there's not a lot to see because it's so heavily one of these bumps . This is just like cladding , isn't it ? This is not the real car . No , no , there's a little bit off the real car , but here we have covered is a lot you can see . And the camera . Maybe you've got this sort of like d i y shop kind of grilled . That's covering up the rial , the real grill , the real identity of the car and all the Mercedes badge have been removed . When you're developing color . This woman , obviously , for this exercise , this is all about the drive train and rather than the aerodynamics and the styling for the aerodynamics , we take all this off .If you come around , you'll see said she caught a big car with A4 . It's obviously an SUV . What are we on here ? Not nineteen's ? That's quite quite tall tires .This is funny . Yes , you don't want us to know what the C pillar is . The C pillar really looks like this . This sort of strange oval kind of poor hole in there . How how close to the production car is the body of this underneath is absolutely . It's finished . It's totally finished . That's coming off . You guys know what it is ? It's all confirmed . It's just people like me on out to see it . But we will see in September this year , and the car is made of steel in or aluminium , steel and aluminium know opposites . Not those composites know . So it's Thea Aluminium Steel together .Yeah , way have a look underneath . Am I allowed to look underneath . Sure you can you look at that ? Yeah , that's legal . That's legal .Sure . I can't see anything . It's all coming up . It's coming up . That is plastic . Yeah . You need Thio . Good drag efficiency . Yeah . So the batteries obviously lived between the axle , But you need the excellencies on their starts here , but I'm gonna quit looking for the country front G5 .Oh , yes . So it is very flat . I can just see the front drive shafts looking . Yeah . Okay .Well , let's carry on driving .Good . Okay , let's go on . Sidestep . Interesting . That's a proper achieve . Anything , is it ? Yep . So if you like it , you can get it .Exactly why you're here now ? Yeah . This is coming from the speaker outside . No noise . So simple for a slow from Monday . Yeah , not too bad . No , no , no . I just hate the fact that there's a law that exists that slight . You know , Europe doesn't exist now , but it will come . But you really have it already in those speeds , and then it fades out . Yeah , you know that , right ? Director , Coming from the current's pretty I can see that you're really You want this car to be completely silent .Yeah , just walk around A3 exterior of the car with Michael on Dhe . We weren't allowed to show on camera under the bonnet when the cameras were off . I gotta look under the bonnet so I could see the front motor on the front motor in the way in which it's set up is amazing . It looks like a tubular steel cradle that is dumped . That's that's for noise dampening okay . But it's also because Way produced the car in the same day registration like a combustion engine car for flexibility reduction so you it can be built alongside a regular production .Linus is an existing G old sea jelly , whatever . It might be a class , so that little cradle allows it motor and everything to be assembled and just put click clipped in . So there's one car come with compassion , and this one is for Levi in the black in hybrid . So all this can do it in the mix as we wanted to build it in one assembly line , and that's the reason why it looks like that forward thinking .Let's talk battery capacity and go on . What can you tell ? May and So we have about 70 kilo . What's off ? Killer dollars off capacity in the battery . 70 killed more than yet . The maximum output is that we use . Yeah , it's rehiring killed lots . Okay , Okay .So wait . Yet We are looking at about 650 kilograms 650I for them something , and it's and it's including everything . I saw you got it under the bonnet , Got a heat pump so you can scavenge heat , which is just great is necessary , especially for winter heating . No doubt . Way of spells .So and that's how aggressive you want the region to bay on the pedals . So where the gearbox would be on the normal Mercedes-Benz gable . So we use the same thing . He's the pedals , leave . We can go like we go now . So we have the so called sailing mode Say , leg your reparations , take my foot off , and it's just Yeah , way can go from Plus . So which means to sail yet against goes through what we have as a d . Like on the conditions engine . Yeah . So you know , this means dr yet and this is like a combustion engine , so you can just feels about take my foot from the pedal and just feel it's Dag on the compassionate . It does . You can go to the heavy one war that that needle is swollen War , right ? That's that was , like , 90% power recharge region . That's right . So I can go one pedal . Well , I don't need the brakes . Okay , so it can be a one pedal operation . Come to activity garden , Greg . That's pretty clear .Some forever breaking not , but , uh , what's what's the Q um , official line on autonomy , autonomous driving something that's gonna come to take you family ? Yeah , way have a two line strategy in general for autonomous driving oneness . Kind of to develop a lovely tune . Three vehicles . So existing driving assistant system . Making it better on an evolutionary approach . Yeah , And then there's the second part , which is defining a new level 4 to 5 system . It's more radical on creates a new kind of people . Yeah , yeah , yes . And I think you're gonna see number one in the first few hours on end . Uh , next one's in Carson's coming up 20 in the beginning of next decade . Okay , 2020 plus 2021 . Well , presumably you're the main competitors your your enemy for that , This car as it were , would be Audi . Easy , Tron . Maybe the Jack . You were either a ce a same size . Same signs on the same segment . Yeah , Wolfgang , are they ? They're gonna have a separate department within Mercedes-Benz . Ships . Has that been decided for Q Sarah thing ? That's kind of a neck trick . If it's 48 volt system could plug in hybrid smart card . It's electric . Yeah , um , it also gonna have you label . And then there's the product , friend where every thanks . Like Oh , yeah . Thank you , Andi . Just a product brand where the product itself is named . Keep like you see . And you mentioned . Probably de Que es us .Whatever . Yes , I'm gonna offer a c charging for sure . And DC charging as well for sure , X1 The precise capacity is gonna be announced later . Maybe a world premiere . Okay . And and the charging plug is it . C c C C s was the walnut . Yes . Yes . It's just gonna be ccs . Difference is coming if you look at 0 to 50 . Yeah , because in the end , zero E400 even does not see how the car accelerate . Yeah , because especially if you are a traffic light or you wanna go somewhere quickly . Yeah , like around town Year . 0 to 50 kilometers an hour is the crucial one . Reddest out recently that you're much less likely to get road rage in an electric car because it's quiet .Trouble relaxing .I'll tell you what , Michael , can you imagine this drive train in a G wagon ? That would be something else . And last time I checked , the G wagon's got quite a lot of surplus space underneath .How cool that Andi just about about but just launched a new G wagon . So you have it there . I'm just , you know , throwing these ideas out there . Come in . They wouldn't sing it . No one say Good to think it's OK . Everybody knows to do every one of its one of those cars . That's like it's It's ridiculous , but at the same time , it's so desirable on DDE fun . Onda For May , the build quality of it is just something else . Is it our fault ? Is it because everyone staring at this pre production meal but will slipper ?It's addictive , isn't it ? That response is the whole day , right ? Well , he does .She's enjoying it so much . Yeah , yeah , tell me about range , guys . Battery range because obviously it's hard to given official range when it depends on the climate . It depends on how you drive blah , blah , blah , I told you , Depends on what kind of cycle you're looking at yet , but it can be up to 500E right , which I think is over 310 miles or something of that speak . That's big Miles .I'm enjoying it . I have to say it's ever so smooth , you know it's composed . It feels like on existing Mercedes-Benz just quieter and with more immediate acceleration , which is a good thing .It's coming out of the corner . Give it a little square there , that's a good run . And do it . That's a good road you have .Badri Factory's definitely won one in comments Germany Deutsche mark a moped . If it's the name of the company on , we're gonna build a 2nd 1 there . What ? We also announces that we have different production plans where we're gonna build que models . One of them is Bremen . We're gonna build a QC . Yeah , but the other one is Beijing way . Also gonna build you see on dhe Also additional batteries oh , way announced that we're gonna build a cue . Models in washed up on similar figure in this well on tests . So all a major production plans will be able to use electric cars really super flexible in the same line as we do the combustion cars . Yeah . So this is this help says a lot when we see that demand off elective kills is rising , we can adapt in production . If it's coming in slower than expected , we can also slow it down . That's clever . So if you go to Tuscaloosa , they're gonna build a bad , replant their go to Beijing . There's gonna be better , right ? Look , Germany , you got two bedroom . We're gonna build a lot , invested heavily into infrastructure , and that's another big that's being invested . Well , thank you very much for this . It's really , really well , it's nice to have the opportunity to be in something that , you know is not commercially available yet . You've devoted three years of your working lives to make sure it's gonna be right . It's always a big deal when it goes toe . When in the world gets to see it . Sure , because you're alone . We've seen it for ages . We've driven it for ages . But it's up to the public . The buying public . Absolutely . What they think we're gonna take up to camouflage in September . Yeah . Then everybody can see . I'm looking forward to the comfort him . No , but see what it's really like ."
51,72,CLS,"This is the new Mercedes C . L s .So this is the kind of car that you're probably gonna be interested in if you would like to get , like , a Mercedes custody . But you see , it is being a little bit too sensible and boring , but the Mercedes E class coupe is just that little bit too impractical for you with its no rear doors . This there you have that coop , a sweeping roof line . But you also have to look , look , look . Some handy A3 adore was there obviously style and practicality .Think about a price in this car actually starts from �58,000 . But through Carl , you can save almost �7000 on on average . If you're 70 conserving this coal , any call for that matter , click on the top right hand corner of the screen would pop out or only below the video to get a car . Wow dot com .So this Cartwright do everything it's gonna do style . It's don't do practicality , and obviously the rear door was a key . But look , here's a star . Bet you have frameless windows , like on a normal keep A8 . Put these down . Secrecy see inside .But What's it like in the back ? Well , any time with me , it's not your right to get in , because those riddles are pretty large . Once you're here , you think . Are there any rooms ? Good enough . Foot room's fine . Then you lean back and you realize , Yeah , that be the price of the sloping roof line . Even my head is touching , and I'm very average in high time . Hundreds of the nine centimeters . Also , because it's a coupe , a like design . The rear windows are quite small , and all I'm saying from my line is this pillar here , so it does feel a bit cramped in the back . Even their legacy is really good If you need to carry three at once . Oh , dear , you ain't gonna like how much is this middle seat ? It's It's an occasional solution you can carry through in the backup once . If you want to hear this middle seat like a vision isn't great , it's quite narrow .Not that convenient that pull this down . You've got this arm . Rest of this , um , bizarre storage under here . You can actually have through loading , though . So if you wanted to ski trip , you got people skis or snowboards through there on people either side , as long as they're short in the body . Of course , as we just established now there's some other things of majors .Enhance this look , this area that just looks cheap and horrible .But there are some charging points there . There's a USB on 12 volt socket that's not particularly nice , which is it takes . The rest of this is pretty well trimmed .Now it's covered with the practicality at the boat . So yeah , a lot the way you open it by flipping up the badge . And the capacity is ever so slightly smaller than that you get with the Audi A7 . It doesn't matter because it's still quite large . The biggest difference , though , is that this car has a saloon boot , a CZ . The Audi has a lift back . Tailgate hatchbacks is a bit more practical and easy to load larger items , though it's not too much of a hardship . This is more like a saloon car . There is a matter of practicality , like vote for these levers . I can't fall down the rear seats . Put those right .It's quite a distance back there . Also , you got some nets . Just hear some tie down points . There's a poor care looking hanging , shopping off that on underneath . Here you have some extra space because there's no spare word on this car on Dhe . Say it is classical of this , the classic shopping basket there , which is collapsible . There's a neat little space right just under there . Now , if you want more detail , this car's practical . A ticket on the Palm Pilot Better on the live below the video To watch my detail . Practicality video , you'd be able to see just how much stuff you can cram into this car's boot .How is this different child ? See what it's like with three adults in the back ?Now let's continue with the practicality theme inside the car . So Mercedes-Benz created quite a lot of storage spaces in this vehicle . I mean , look at this . Right to the doorbells can hold . Know what two large bottles there . You've got some more space under here is quite deep , and their various charging ports in there as well . There's more space under here . Lucky got to cup holders . There's a Wallace charging pad , their mobile phone on another us be there . And of course , the glove box is a reasonable size . There's also look place for your sunglasses . They just need the S O s button , which comes standard on this car . In fact , equipment levels very good . There's only one trim available in the U . K and that's MG line , and it gets pretty much everything you need to just 19 inch Allah whales .You get leather interior .You also get around parking sensors and reversing camera .And these two huge digital screens now breathe into the entertainment system so I can operate it through the central system here , using the usual Mercedes Way with the swivel . Will this touch powered on dhe ? Actually , the system's a lot better than older Mercedes , its prey blooming good . You can easily navigate through all the different functions with radio getting navigation all simple . And if I want , I can't control things here through these steering wheel controls on , I can control this screen using this side or this screen using this side touch control . And there's like two different features . I can change the look that dials . It's all very good and pretty easy to use now for more information on what this system is like two years clicking the pop up out of the top right hand corner of the screen on the link below the video to watch my detailed infotainment video review .Now I should point out this car hasn't called . The premium plus package is just over three and 1/2 grand on includes integrated satellite navigation system , which includes online service there .So you're basically Internet connectivity within the car for various different reasons . That package includes the Burr Mr Hi Fi , which sounds awesome . You also get electrically operated memory seats on dhe . Look , you get an electrically operated steering column and really in Mercedes , you shouldn't have to do things manually .The premium plus package includes this look . Assume grief , though it's not exactly the largest must I do like the interior design of this car ?Almost as much as I like next year , which is just sleek and beautiful once again , it's swooping here on the inside are like the turbine effect of those air vents are like this trimmers well here . I think it's wart on my entirely sure , but it looks and feels quite nice and said to the rest of the materials in general , apart from that bit in the back of showed you earlier .So this car I've got here with a diesel engine , it costs from room �64,000 . However , I played the details into call . Wow . And I got an offer back for �57,000 of saving of around seven grand .Now , then it's time for the car while A5 annoying things about this car .There are only two son of painkillers on the C . L s black and white .Everything else is a cost option . It's great . For instance , �700 .This is really cool looking car , but this little Mercedes-Benz out here , it's a touch NAFTA . When you're driving , it's forever .You know , I line I really hate the way that Mercedes uses these fake exhaust tips on its diesel cars . I mean , it's completely unnecessary . I assure you that fate Now we're using the car . Wow , stick of truth . So there's a stick . Look , he doesn't go anywhere , just blanked off . So there's the truth .This'll car has a slightly offset driving position on . I'll illustrate it now with another car winds , Stick of truth . It's just a different variety stick of truth . So if I places on the center of my chest . Put it in front of me . You'll see that it isn't in the center of the three pointed star on that can make you feel a little bit twisted behind the wheel .The need straight six diesel engine in this car is very smooth when you're driving it , but it's just idle . Taking over sounds a bit like a van , actually . Can you turn the van off ?Let's see what I mean .It's not all negative , though . Here's five good things about this car .According to this equipment list for this particular car , it is fitted with the optional energizing comfort control . So this systematically uses the functions of the climate control system , including fragrance sing . That's what this is . Some kind of party called Free Side moved . He combines it with the heated seats as well as lighting a musical atmospheres , allowing specific wellness set up Taylor to the mood in need of the customer .As result . Well being on performance levels are enhanced .Well , all that's missing is well , song and some mindfulness Theo led headlights on this car . As bright as the law allows , the high beam produces the same amount of light per square meter as a candle at a distance of 650 meters , which is really quite impressive . The car's reversing camera is neatly hidden under the Mercedes badge . It pops out when you put the car into reverse , and then when you drive off , it disappears again so it doesn't get covered in red .The interior ambient lighting is linked . The car's climate control system on the lighting round events actually changes color as you change the temperature so as to make it warmer . It goes red to indicate that . And then if you make it colder , of course , go blue . And eventually it will go back to the color that you chose from the 64 different options . And I've gone for Green , which is number 47 in the Park Pilot system .You can use an app on your mobile phone to remote part the car , either in or out of a bait to make it easy to get in or out . Now , I actually don't have the app for my phone , but then I don't need it because I have stuff to do the hard work for me .You know , I said this engine was noisy . When it's just idly while actually when you're driving , it's really , really quiet , in fact , is one of the quietest , smoothest diesels I've ever driven .It's also the most powerful diesel Mercedes has ever fitted to one of its cars . So it's got French and 40 horsepower and could not 60 in just five seconds that you put your foot down and it's just relentless . The rust that is really , really quick . Economy's really good as well . So Masae Audi says when they do 48 miles per gallon , No , I'm getting 38 almost 39 which is actually no bad consuming how quick it is . They can get a less powerful version of this three litre straight six diesel , and you can also get a three litre , turbo charged petrol engine as well . But I think this is the engine to go for in terms of the rest of the driving experience .It's pretty lovely , so the night speed automatic gearbox is really smooth , and it's responsive , and change gives itself . If you want to use the paddles , it's comfy as well . But that's because this one has the optional air suspension , which just floats over bumps . The standard suspension isn't quite so , but it can fidget bit at low speeds . R8 . It's worth your grade .One thing that does surprise me about this car is really is quiet , but it doesn't seem quite as quiet when traveling at speed as an Audi A7 . You just get a bit more noise from the tires on dhe . Some wind whistle from around here , which is not really because it's a very sleek aerodynamic shape .Thankfully , though , doesn't really impaired visibility . So , yeah , it's to sweep this pillar here . But this image of a blind spot and you can get decent V8 the back window , so it's actually not too bad to maneuver this car in town .As for the handling well yet for real drivers standard on all models , so you got plenty of grip . But remember , this is still a big car may look sporty , but it doesn't feel the most sporty to drive . It's more of a relaxed cruiser . Still , I do not the steering it feels precise , and you can feel what the front wheels are doing . Unlike in the idea A7 I want . If you want to , you could put into sports mode , and that was stiffer suspension . Which means it doesn't lean so much in corners , though you do notice the books a bit more in the road that it's all about trade offs . This is all about trade offs .If you want more information on this car or two so much you can save on one or any car .

So are they telling the truth ?Theo Headline facts about the new M3 . It's got a tiny bit more power than before , from a straight six twin turbocharged engine turbocharged . That's the key word , but that also corresponding before �120 feet more talk than the old via M3 . Keep that in the back of your head . Amazing statistic that is . You start to put a least things together . More power , mortal , less weight , more sophistication , better economy on DDE .Then you put it with the price , which is no more than the Elle com , and you very quickly start to reach a conclusion that this is an immense amount of car for works , endlessly in all sorts of directions to make the new M3 better to make it lighter toe improve thehe lech trove mechanicals dearing to make the brakes better toe . Just , you know , everything is always going to be better on a new M3 and ease . The steering is lovely . The brakes have great feeling . Huge power . You can definitely detect that there is less weight to carry you M3 , and that's a great thing because it just spreads throughout the whole of the rest of the car's dynamics .You can also get a six speed manual gearbox standard . Give us he's getting one end , but with a few modifications . This one that has the paddle shifts , the dual clutch option on DDE . I don't know . I haven't tried a manual to be fair , but this is the way this paddle shift gearbox works . It's just it's just so good . Couple down .If you can afford it . Theo .The cabin is a pretty nice place , actually . Lovely , thick , chunky steering wheel . No to think this time . Great seats . Really nice , clear , typically kind of driver centric .

I love the new M3 For that , I'm not sure how relevant it is to drive it on the public road , but I mean the fact that you could do it and the fact that it will do that so nicely it's just lovely .But there is one huge caveat with this car . Is it huge ? Caveat . No , it Z8 decent size career , and that is the nature and the sound from the engine . It's it's a kind of it's not boring . It's just a bit just a bit flat .90% of the new BMW M3 I love . I love the steering . Love the brakes . Love the chassis . The ride is really good .Two cabins , nice prices deeply appealing , as is the overall specifications car .But it's just it's just the motor on it . Sounds like a terrible cliche , but I'm just not sure that this can benefit from being turbocharged . I know that means it's more ecologically sound , and it's more you know , the emissions of far less et cetera , et cetera . But come on , the engine is at the center of every in car , surely on dhe . The engine in this particular and card is whilst amazingly efficient , bursting with talk is just no , it doesn't have that rip to it real proper M engine has had in the past . But I'm afraid that now seems like it is a thing of the past , but the rest of the caf it's fine"
53,74,M1,"so seize the BMW one . M arrived on our fleet last June . It's done this on face on this .After 14,000 miles and nine months in this crazed bulldog of a car , you could say we're sad to see oh , from squaring up to the Cayman R and spending half its time doing this kind of thing . What else have we liked aboutthe one in ? And have there been any downsides along the way ?Good bits involved pretty much anything that happens when you were in the move in this car , I mean , the engine might be turbo charged in somehow know , keeping the culture of a proper M car . But it's an absolutely monster on the move . I mean , if you didn't know this engine was turbocharged , I don't recognize gays because the throttle response on the power delivery what a great hit talk you get is just amazing . It just feels so natural . So a new turbo charged .I also just love the way this car handles . I mean , it might not be , is a sure and incisive as a came and and it definitely doesn't have as much grip . But over the last nine months , I've come to realize that that actually might not be a bad thing . I mean , get a load of this .Downsides . Well , you do tend to get stared at , whether you like it or not in a one end , which is something that Valencia orange paint scheme does not a lot to alter .The front seats also seem to have developed a mind of their own when you climb in and out of the rear . For some reason , the memory functions gone .And if you drive it all hard , don't expect much in the world economy . Best we saw in nine months was about 27 mpg .Worst 16 being honest , the right qualities pretty poor on UK roads , too .But that did improve a lot when we put these on , which is set of 18 inch Mitchell in pilot winter tires .But bear in mind , they do at �1900 to the price .WeII . I guess we were always gonna love our time with the one in . It's that kind of car , after all . But maybe the best realization awful after 14,000 miles , why 11 g o x ? It is not merely that . It's a great car . It's that It's a great income . That makes it very special indeed .I'm gonna miss you , old friend . Best of luck with whoever you get next ."
54,75,M3,"this , then , is the new a BMW em to competition . Now there are various tears to the BMW em hierarchy . At the top are CS models . Then they're our competition models like this one . Then come regular high performance M cars such as the regular M two and M5 on . Then finally , there are M performance cars . So anything within M prefix like , say , an M5 50 d extra torrent . This , then , is the M two competition . So it is a more hardcore version of the regular M , too , which is a car we already like and is already relatively hard call . It's kind of old school , but not old fashioned , if you like . This one is a manual , which is called too .So the M two competition is shaping up like a good car , isn't it ? I mean , it's relatively compact , so it's the right size .It has the right engine .It's got the right weight balance .It ought to be a good fun car .Competition takes all that turns everything up a little bit .You still only get passive dampers . You still don't get it .Oh , you get it .You don't get carbon ceramic discs you , But you cannot break the brakes .This one has it on . I just sent in it .So you're learning as only place Gold a scarry , which is in Spain , offer from Malaga . Long circuits are racetrack per se .It's somebody sort of personal , like First , they'll tell you it feels louder than the regular into .Sounds really nice , Actually , that's far .So the M two competition gets a bit less soundproofing .A bit more power gets struck .Brace in the front .Suspension isn't vastly different . I'll go into detail about it a minute out on the road . I think the upshot is is that it is a more hardcore version off the regular M two . Steering more precisely , Get more back straight away . Changes direction better .Changes direction Really nicely . It's got a differential . Hooks up justice , turning their back on the back . Just feel it squat down . I'm at the moment in standard DSC Boat just took up . Just keys in Standard M two is good . This is really , really nice .Still plenty of talk that's got a turbo charged six cylinder engine that produces a decent amount of talk from narrow , so you don't need to be totally up in a long time . You don't need to rev it away to the other side of seven . I don't think just feel the traction control slipping in . But even though this is in this town of mode , it's no to nanny , and it's not too in your face .This is a really nice girl , is a really nicely balanced , agile , responsive guard , even more responsive than before , I think because of embracing of the front , which just gives that extra steering , precision , extroverted , turn in and agility .Key competitor , I think for the M two has always bean Porsche S7 , 18 came in on Dhe A7 18 .Cayman always did keep the things that mid engine balance means that it's quick response . Thio turning the weight is closer to the middle of it meant that it was more agile . And even though you could slide the M two , I think probably more easily . A7 18 just has that better sports car thing about . This sets out to redress some of that balance , I think , and really does it , as far as I can tell , really expertly , just tidy . They have understood that that's with MGM , moved into sports here , see most still on , but it really does allow a nice bit of speed on this day .But if you just come on the brakes as you turn it on and then even though that's only 4000 ribs on so annoying , right , the power , he's got enough power there . A4 at 4000 ready to just balance the chassis on the way out fast .This is a really nice car . I like this a lot . So that second with the devil , it's allowing a nice mess like this is cool . This is really , really cool . You know what ? On a track day , I think it suits twisty circuits . It doesn't feel overly harshly sprung on track . Davis would be a really great thing to drive . Really good fun . Really , really good fun . Liking this a lot . What's it like ? It's a road car . Well , stay with me .I'll run you through some technical details on Dhe , then head out onto the road on find out what it is like a Z8 . What changes then , between the M two on dth e m to competition .Well , the big news is the new engine . Previously , the M two had a single turbo charge straight . Six . Where's the M two now replaces with the engine effectively from the M3 and M four . It has two Turbos instead of one will be here . It's de tune to 404 horsepower rather than the M 4 425 There are bigger brakes , too , and a new exhaust .It has electrically controlled flaps for a bit more noise , but I think the biggest difference in the way the M two competition drives will come from the chassis changes . There is a wishbone shaped engine bay brace . The envoy has one of these two on this retune steering that plus Rose joining in the rear suspension . The stability control has been recalibrated , and new spring and damper settings finish the job , BMW say's of improving response on on Lim handling what it means for the ride .We'll find out other changes . A limited to improve the calling , which , as little weight plus , there's new wheels , optional seats and different door mirrors .But the general goodness of the M two remains intact .So what does a ll that translate to as a road come well , the right still relatively blind . There is an extra amount of steel response and feed back to its really precise now really , really nicely precise , actually , where some M cars when they arrived , they have steering that is accurate enough , but a little bit bully around the edges . This feels really , really , absolutely tiptop . You point , it goes on . There is also because of the changes were there is a little bit more accuracy from the way the rear follows the front as well . So although there is some bump absorption and everything else , it just stares with keenness that was not there before .It makes the car feel lighter , and losing is really welcome to it . Makes it . It's a real part of the immersive experience now that engine notice so smooth , stability control is not too disruptive even on the road .There , you pop it into the MGM , which is a kind of half off mode . It just allows a little bit more slip before it gets involved . That just liberates some of the handling characteristics on the right corner , where you miles and you just , you know , a slow one slowest quarter with a nice exit just straightened out a bit on exit . It's just really good car to drive this a really good God to drive this . So that's the question . Is it ? Ultimately , How good is it ?Because the last one had a better engine ? The last one ? The current M , too , which this have competition , effectively replaces because there's no reason why you have a regular into when the competition is this good .So what are the changes that felt so good on track translate to on the road ? It doesn't take long to realize they're actually the same feel on dhe interaction . You gone circuit you could access very usually on the road . Changes to the suspension are not fundamental , but the little tweaks that there are make a big difference . That struck brace in front just seems thio , given extra amount of stiffness , which translate back into the steering rack so the steering is much more precise . This one is a manual you can get between clubs , but I think that manual is a nice car for this kind of old school sports Hatch Sports coupe , where you don't have adaptive suspension , you don't have carbon ceramic brakes .It's just a very straightforward , front engined , rear drive sport on the Internet's really liberated a bit of extra from it as well .Gearboxes good against shit is good , but on roads like this , a lot roads , actually , you know , you're really changing here for the fun of it .You could just let this turbocharged engine lugging out from lower ribs where it really helps exploit the chassis . And that is where we are . I guess the first generation into it had an engine that was better than a caiman handling that was not quite as good .And I think the Cayman remained the better sports car .This time around , the engine has gone up yet another notch . So the engine is better again .Then the four cylinder in the Porsche on the handling and the response on the field , on the goodness , all of those bits that make your fingers tingle when you go on the right road . I think now is pretty much there . It's got to be really close to the border . I'd love to try the two back to back .It's gotta be really much , pretty much there . I think this is now . Then the best mid range sports car you could find"
55,76,i8,"despite its near �100,000 price tag BMW , it could be one of the best value cars on sale right now , I think about it .Beneath its aluminium and carbon reinforced plastic body shell , I A8 is bursting at the seams with technology , most of which works a treat on . All of which would have cost BMW an absolute fortune to engineer way before we get into any more detail .About what ? That's right . Is it a sports car ? Is it fun or is it just a techno fist wheels ?So I know the eye is predominantly all about it's ICO credentials , and half smart is a sports car and how little carbon it throws into the atmosphere , etcetera . But you know , it's also proper sports car . You put it in sport , you put your foot down . On it goes it really , really goes , and it sounds . I love you is a hybrid , of course , and as such is propelled by a combination of forces . Main thrust comes from a 1.5 later three cylinder petrol turbo engine . This produces 228 horsepower on 236 butt dial in the efforts of two different electric motors on the combined outputs rise to 3 57 BHP on 4 �20 feet of talk on despite its 200 kilogram lithium ion battery pack thing I Ate is also light for a hybrid , thanks to that carbon plastic in a dominion .So it weighs a pretty decent 1560 kilograms .And that , in a nutshell , means it's fast how fast thief performance figures all out . I'm not 16 A4 A4 A4 on it feels as if you get 100 about it . You know , it's properly fast in a straight line , and it's really , really talking that big benefit you get from the power and its charge together and they get another 24 started , which is a really nice touch on bended knee so that that just fills the gaps between where the pound drops off the combustion engine kicks in . As a result , you pee for down in mystic , and it goes like I mean , no , it doesn't . It doesn't quite kind of sing like a 9 11 might sink , but range of noises on this just a minute range throbs this wonderful . It really seriously exciting . Got to drive and drive .There are four different DR programs in the A8 e mod ICO Pro Comfort and Sport . The range is around 25 miles , and in theory , car has an overall range of around 1500 miles . Back in the real world , though , fuel consumption rarely drops below 35 mpg , no matter how hard drive on a more gentle motorway , trips averages at least 60 mpg , which is pretty decent , given that the 0 to 62 time is 4.4 seconds . And in sport mode , the A8 feels and sounds at least as quick as an Audi R8 V8 .The steering is a electromechanical , of course , is is bound to be on a car like this on . There isn't much kind of touchy feely loveliness coming through the room , but the steering is very , very accurate . You can place the knows perfectly through any corner on alert . It's light . I actually really quite like the way this Carstairs , So the eye regenerates .It's e power father breaks , but also , when you're in sport mode , which I am now just giving a little bit drag when you're a frontal . So basically any time that you're no absolutely flat on the floor , The throttle . It's just kind of tickling itself electrically on DDE regenerating battery power , which is great . That's exactly how the Laferrari works .Another thing that I'm really impressed by is the brake field . A lot of hybrids harness that power by the brakes . Just have a horrible feeling . Brake pedals . You kind of have this awful sensation that you're pressing against something , and the car is not slowing down . And yet when you tell you foot off the throttle , you see a treacle . The I It's not like that . But there is this slight feeling of drag you get when you come off trouble . But it's not too strong on the field through the pedal itself . I mean , don't fly by wire stuff . But the field through the bill itself is really is pretty good property . It really does .He's got these pathetically skinny little tyres on it from Andrea .And if you really , really start to lean on it , yes , it does understand . No question , but just a thread along the lovely road like this , which is kind of far .I just feel really does feel wanted . It doesn't feel four wheel drive . It feels like a really , really great , really well sorted , composed , rear wheel drive car . Just so happens to have phenomenal traction . No matter what you do with Rachael out any corner and the valleys is go . Mid corner in particular is lovely . And that , I guess , is because the central gravity is pretty low .I mean , I I know this thing weighs 1550 kilograms because it's got a battery pack , et cetera .But the flip side to that is that allows engineers to get that way really low because the battery's really low in the car and you can feel that corner of the eye feels really , really nicely balanced , just stuck .Okay , so the other side of the eye it's personality is what happens when you press . E . Dr . The ride changes . The ride becomes more comfortable .Obviously , the exhaust note disappears completely . It becomes a milk float .Um , the throttle map changes . Obviously you don't have a combustion engine on the right foot anymore , and I don't know , there's just there's just something really intriguing and fascinating and quite nice actually about this bumbling around with no noise , no engine noise at all .I'm actually because the tires So give me there's so much So I know it's either you could just a little bit of gear one from the from the gay books over the front axle and that's it .It's kind of surreal . It's kind of nice as well . I like driving .So the next step up from a mode is comfort . It's basically any mode until you really nail it .Z8 . That's quite nice , actually . So you can just It's all dependent on what you do with the truffle , if you like , with frightful everywhere , you kind of almost tease it into a little bit longer than than it normally otherwise would .But then , if you nail it because you suddenly need to take , then the combustion engine is just right there . It's quite cool , actually , and then you've got ICO pro .Would you get another ? BMW is where you always hints up on the dashboard here about how to drive about how much throttle to use at any given time to get the absolute maximum , and the absolute maximum theoretical mpg is 134 134 mpg and stake your foot down and it goes looking has a proper range of abilities .Great , I really do . It's just it's completely fascinating . Okay , It's Noah's pure two drivers , a 9 11 Nothing like really , but just the range of things that it could do in the way in which it does . I think it's great , I really do .But I also think it's fantastic . Value 95 grand 94 grand BMW says that it is not a loss leader . They say that no car would ever be given the green light if it didn't make a profit for the company . But I don't know . I'm not so sure I believe them at this moment in time , because there is so much tech . There is so much clever stuff in his car . Fanny by 95 Grand's phenomenal .I really , really like me , I think probably the most interesting car driven this year that costs with okay , it's a kind of junior Laferrari , really , for 95 grand .Wow ,"
56,77,X6,"We're driving one of the most politically incorrect cars to go on sale this year . BMW New X6 four by four This is the free liter V six diesel version of the X6 , so it's got 286 BHP . It's fast with it to 6.9 seconds for 63 miles an hour on 146 mile an hour top speed put down .That makes a great noise for diesel as well . But the thing is , I can't go off road .It makes no pretence at being a family car . It's only got four seats , and really , it's just designed to go quickly down a B road . There's no arguing that the BMW X6 doesn't have its downside , although it may look great .There's not an awful lot of room inside . There's only four seats on this . The sloping roof light means that if I try and get into the back , I'm six foot one . There's no way I want to do a long journey in the back of this car . Got plenty of room width wise , but as you can see , my heads against the ceiling on my knees , air in the back of the driver's seat .At first , the X6 may seem a bit pointless , a bit too much of a poses car . That is , until you get it on a fast B road like this , where you realize that it is actually the best handling . Four by four on sale today . Bond , a Porsche Cayenne , included Ranger sporting leading F40 rolls Being doled out former is completely compared with the extra eyes on four wheel drive system means that you can just power out of corners . Just absolute confidence , even in weather like this thief problem they were driving a car like the X6 is that it makes everybody else on the road .Hagan . I've never driven a car that irritates other road users as much merchant bank twice already , right ?We're on the motor way back to London now , supporting a bit of traffic , but it gives me a chance to tell you around the neck sixties cabin . It's very functional , very typical BMW . Very high quality on the steering wheel . There these paddles , which pretty unconventional they're sort of triggers under your thumb and rover , then left foot down and right for all you have to touch that drop a couple of days . Then there's this gearshift down here , which , frankly , instead of changing , you could be launching a Scud missile , BMW says .X6 is sold out for a year already , and I expect many of them will end up stuck in more affluent parts of town like this . They shouldn't just be dismissed . There's another Chelsea tractor . Okay , it is a complete post . It's not very practical , but it's also one of the best handling SUV's that money can buy on the way it goes down the road is something really special that's important to you , then I can't recommend it highly enough ."
57,78,M3,"Hello . My name's Steve Suck riff on the car you're looking at is , of course , the brand new BMW M3 . It's a pretty exciting car , and the reason it's exciting is BMW first V8 A3 . The old car was a six cylinder car . This one's gotta V8 . It's got a lot more power than the last one . It weighs about the same as the last one cost �51,000 . It's time , but the ingredients are pretty mouth watering , really ? So let's find out what it's like .Okay , so that's the new M3 . Very , very impressive . Very impressive . It's a lot faster than the old . Well , maybe not a lot for us . It's definitely fast in the old on which , which is saying something , because the old one was extremely quick . It's a very civilized , quite a lot more civilized in the old one , but the surprising thing is , it's it's quite soft . It's deliberately , deliberately civilized , which , if you would just judge it on its own . That's not necessarily a great thing , because all of a sudden M3 has . It's kind of slightly lost its way in terms of personality , but it's very , very old base from joining this car is gonna be another version of M3 CSL version BMW of all , but admitted as much on that . That car will appear very soon . So judging this car , in light of that , you can understand what they're doing . And I was up 365 day a road car . It's pretty impressive ."
58,79,i3,"According to BMW , the I three is the world's first premium electric vehicle , ignoring the fact that the excellent Tesla model s has been with us for some time now . What BMW was trying to say , I think , is that the eye three is desirable , just like every other BMW . It's an electric car , which convention excuses aren't required . In other words , and as such , it can and should be judged much like any other BMW .So on the move , the first thing that strikes you about the A3 it's the same thing that strikes you about a LL TV's on this . This I've selected Dr I'm putting my foot down .It doesn't matter how many times you do . It's always really spooky . You just start moving and there's no noise at all . I mean , 100% in mode at the moment . I'll show you what you could do with a range extender in a minute .First thing that strikes you once you've got over the TV bit is that the right is It feels absolutely , typically like a BMW in that there's this underlying sense of kind of firm reassuring . Call it sporting us if you if you would . But you just detect every little grain of change in texture of Thomas beneath you back , sir . And I like that because I like to know exactly what's going on down there on the road between the tires on the road surface on the other three has that lots of other Evie's . In fact , I don't think any other Eves other than the Tesla model s give you that . Same . I am driving a proper car sensation , and it's really nice . It's great .The I three is powered by an electric motor that generates 168 BHP on �184 feet of talk . That makes it more potent than the McClaren P one in evey power alone .Interestingly , it's also extremely light for a navy , but just 1195 kilograms .And that's thanks to the extensive use of a new material called carbon fiber reinforced plastic throughout its construction . This also makes it stiff , maybe a touch too stiff .In certain circumstances , the steering is just a little bit heavier than you might expect , considering how exactly narrow front tires are .I mean , look at this . Look how much like a bicycle tire fat looks , but this proper feel through the steering , even if the steering wheel itself .It feels nice enough in the hands , but it just looks a bit weird .It looks bit spindly , the performance , but it's way the right side of spite BMW . Reckon it'll get to 16 7.2 seconds . We figured it just a whisker over eight seconds , but either way you took it . I call this properly brisk . I mean , we're talking about a warm hatchback .Inevitably , the brakes do feel a little bit weird to begin with because there's regenerative braking going on , which means when you lift off the throttle , you get this kind of dragging effects . It feels like you driven into a sea of treacle in the car , wants to stop on its own without repressing the brake pedal . That's because it's regenerating power .Back to the batteries are the breaks as you break . And then if you actually properly break my breast in the pedal , that's when he gets a bit weird , because it feels a bit unnatural . But ultimately , the eye three stops really , really well , I'm not sure I quite go for the scissor doors .It's a bit weird . I don't understand why you couldn't just have a conventional set area doors that open independently from the front doors . You cannot open the rear doors without front door being open . I kind of see that Z8 beginning really , rather than genuinely useful . I don't get it on . The boots are a bit small . The boot in the front , please pathetic on the boot in the back is quite badly compromised by the fact that you go a little motorbike engine in the back there . But you know , there's just about enough big space and there's loads of room inside .Okay , six foot two and above are gonna be a little bit uncomfortable in the back seats . But up here , that's just beautiful feeling of spaciousness .Really nice , clear ergonomics . Nice fresh dash designed , which doesn't really have a conventional instrument cluster in a really nice big screen over there .For all the governs , the government's let's talk about the government's let me slow down , stop and just show you through governs . So by playing with the I drive button down with the gear lever might normally be , you can swap between pure evey and range extender modes check out your own driving techniques , pre load the heating system and even get tips on how to drive your A3 as economically as possible .It's a fake it ridiculous , but you can actually turn the traction control off in the eye . A3 . It doesn't mean you can turn everything off , unfortunately , but you get this kind of dynamic mode traction control system , and you can probably chuck it about , and it does respond really well . Chuck it about under stairs , ultimately understood because there's a lot of weight in the back of the car on .There is no way BMW would possibly have allowed it to oversteer , no matter how many safety systems is gone .But actually , if you do throw around , it does . It goes pretty much where you wanted to , so long as you don't flying to a corner too fast . Education just got understeer . Understeer understand . A3 basically handles and handles well . It feels good to drive this thing . It really does .The reality of the range is what BMW claims about 80 miles worth of electric power , which takes you about 34 hours to charge from a normal plug on about the same again from the petrol engine . But I have to say , I've been hitting it around a bit today and I've done Oh , don't I ? 30 old miles and I've only got 21 miles left , apparently so I'd say the real world ranges is probably 70 to 80 on E power , probably 70 to 80 on on the petrol as well . But even so , that's 160 mile range . How often do you do 160 miles in one journey ?Okay , so is because there is so little noise , in fact , known always at all from any kind of engine . Elikann here is this kind of road rubble because there's nothing else to interrupt that noise .It's actually starting to become a little bit so conclusion about the BMW A3 as an evening . It takes the game into a completely differently . Compared with such a Nissan leaf , it's not quite as compelling is not quite as intriguing and interesting as the Tesla model s , but in many ways , is it kind of junior version of that card got some proper performance .It drives really nicely . The steering is good , the handling is good , ride feels BMW , and it's not too expensive .The purely electric version costs �25,000 . With this one with the Range extender , which is definitely one you'd have costs 28,000 . That's a lot of money , but this is a lot of car .A3 is very good borders ."
59,80,A Class,"This is the new Mercedes A class , and it really is all new . So you got new body panels , that new mechanicals and all new technology in fact states lots of kit from the S class . It really should be the poshest small car you can buy . But in this video , I'm gonna find out if that's true . If you're wondering what the heck I'm carrying the camera myself is because it wasn't a space on this launch from a cameraman . So Apologies , Pope .What if this turns out like Mercedes-Benz for the old A class ? Because , to be honest , it wasn't that good . However , it's still sold strongly because , well , it was the cheapest way to get into a new Mercedes .Now , image really matters on this car has one thing going for it from the get go that three pointed star that was in lots of buyers . But the rest of the design is really smart . It builds on the old car and just improves it . You got the pen effect grilled at the front . This particular car is the AMG lines , so you get some more aggressive from bumper treatment . There's conceived with these vets down the side on being the addition warm . This has an extra Why look yellow striping on it . One thing to note on this car with headlamps and very , very Narron Sleek really gives the car quite . I mean , look on Dhe , the new A8 caskets . Mercedes . You design language . He got very flat body panels . Not too many creases on in this map . Gray Paint it . Cliff looks like a pebble . There's been washed smooth by the sea over hundreds of years . It really is a nice luck .This one's riding on 19 inch Allah wills .It can see you got the yellow effect . Rand was robbed of your dream for this edition model . There you go , the Lord tradition car because the A 2 50 now down the side once again , not too many creases keep quite flat , but it definitely has a very nice look to it round the back . It builds on the old coal once again , but just looks more modern . Look sleeker . Got bigger , tell lights there but more pointy on DDE . It's a very nice looking back end , but I do want to see something , because down here it looks like we've got some proper exhaust pipes are they ? Are they really are not ? No . They lead to nowhere once again Mercedes-Benz continuing its trend off fake exhaust pipes . I wish you'd stop doing it .What is it to tell you ? The truth is cost predecessor wasn't even Maur serious offender of form over function . So has Mercedes-Benz game this time round .One of the problems of the old A class was its boot opening , so it was very , very narrow . Now let's see if they've improved it and lo and behold , they definitely have . It's much easier to get stuff into the boot . The size is all right . What you got is just a little bit less in a Volkswagen golf . So not the biggest . But it's all right . There would do like this feature . You have three way folding seats available , and , as you can say , they fold flat . Look brilliant . Let's check out the actual space on the inside for the rear passengers .Once again , the old acres . It wasn't brilliant . Hyping this is gonna be better to put the seat back . I hope my camera dime . You can talk to them and I Well , look , this thing's my driving position by sort of dead . Straight bedrooms . All right , knee rooms . All right . Comfy place to rest on there . It's all pretty good . I've got an arm .Rest here is well on GWU , some cup holders .I am more than happy . Lucky , Yeah , absolutely fine . The smallish windows to make it a whole sport doesn't mean that he's not the brightest back here , but it's not too bad at all . I find I'm feeling bed Nilka Bushel .That's because the new A8 classes slightly longer and wider than before and therefore more roomy inside .But really , what sets this new car apart is its incredible cabin . I have to tell you , I absolutely love into it is under this car . It moves the game on by some margin compared to that of its rivals . I love these events the way they're like turbines , the step dash . But obviously the past bet is this huge display panel say , consists of two screens out standard . You get to seventh displays . This has the upgraded one so you can upgrade the size of individual screens one or the other . This hasn't both done on looks marvelous , absolutely glorious .Let's talk about the one for the driver so I can control that through this steering wheel merited controls head just like you get in the s class . In fact , that sting Will is just like in his class . This is Mercedes entry level car . It's wonderful . So lots of different menus you can cycle through . You can change the displays around , make it look different . Taste the dolls , control everything you want to pretty much control all through this it's dead easy and simple to do nice and easy to use . And then there's the central screen . Now you can operate it using the touch pad which actually vibrates . So it has happened the back . So you know you're operating these or you can actually use it like a normal touch screen to swipe through it . Now , on this particular car , I have some very nice features . So if I go into the car settings go to seek comfort on dhe , get massage seats . Now , unlike other massage seats which have air blood is in them . What this actually does is just move part of the sea about mechanically to just keep the blood flowing around your body . You know , you get really top in tech in this supposedly lowing car . I'm very , very impressed with it then this voice activation so you can control things in many cars by pressing a button to activate the voice . But you can actually operate this like a bit like you can operate Alexa Amazons , Lexa or Google . So we'll have to say is how you miss a day's How can I help you direct me to split airport ?I am starting route guidance to split April SMU . Castell assessed er Doctor Franch taverna . But then what ? Every proved ? It is , but it's got the right place . It is the airport .S8 is cancelled . Guidance route guidance canceled . You know that's the way to control this car . Really ? It's all very good .I know some of the materials . Absolutely lovely . These on the dash is still world of seats and lovely as well . This gloss back frame , it looks good , but I can already see some scratches on it . And this is a brand new car . Then there's one or two pieces which just feel wrong and cheap . For instance , thes switches down here . I mean that . Look at that . They're like the offer toy . These things are gonna touch . That is my only gripe , though . In another wise , brilliant cabin .Now it doesn't come cheap . So the stock price of this car's over �26,000 . The one I'm in here is well over �30,000 . Now , if you don't see what you can save on any car , click on the pop out better in the top right hand corner the screen to get a car . Wow dot com and you are gonna want to get as good a deal is possible because of the extensive array of cool options like the groundbreaking , augmented reality satellite navigation system .This is is a camera to display the road ahead and then overlays direction graphics on top of the image so you know exactly where to go and never make a wrong turn . Nor get confused , which exit to take on a roundabout . It's absolutely brilliant . Then at night you can amuse yourself with the 64 different ambient lighting options and turn your a class into a circus Olay .And let's not forget about the class leading driver assistant systems , which are better than you get in an Audi A3 or BMW one . Siri's now the Great thing about this a class is that you get a ll the autonomous driving take that you get with the S class . So I've got to cruise control . Give me a safe distance from the car in front door . So gonna auto stared to keep me in lane on dhe . It's got lane change assessed . So if I put the indicator on the senses no checking that it's safe for me to move into that lane on . Lookit moving across into the lane . I don't have to do anything . Look at that . If I want , it will move me back again . Once again , the sensors are checking . It's all safe to do so and it's moving me back .Makes it easier . Driving longer distances also means that you're less lights actually maneuver into a space where someone is already there . This small car has such big car tech really impressive . Now I do wonder how long I could just drive along without actually put my hands on the wheel . So let's see , what special do this really practiced ? But I'm always interested to see There we go looking started flashing warning . It probably won't do lane change assist now if I ask for it ? Because I haven't took the will for a long enough time . So he thinks I'm not sure you're there , mate . I'm gonna start freaking out . There's the first audible warning . Want to get into next ? Do that again . Still get him in line . Nice and central in Lane . Actually , that's enough to put me off . Climb into the back , Governor . It's gonna do an emergency stop . So slow the car down . Things have lost the blot on it . Yes , it's slowing it down . It put on the hazard lights so it just slows it inland puts on the hazard lights . They will take over next . I don't annoy the traffic A3 responsible after all . Sensible motoring journalist . You just gotta testing systems out there . Haven't you know that's the only way to do it .And seeing as I'm a sensible motoring journalist , I should assess how the cast actually drives after all , the old one was a bit of a disappointment in this department . So how about the new car ? Well on place report that it's much , much better . So I'm driving in Croatia , Some of the roads , they're pretty bad on dhe because doing an admirable job of smoothing out some of the bums . Now I should point out that this being the 18 fifties has a more sophisticated rear independent suspension system In the letter cars that have a torch on beam and that's a bit like this car's rear suspension is champagne . Where's the lesser models ? Is more like Persico . Also , you can get all models with adaptive suspension so you can press a button and put them in comfort mode . Got this kind of comfort mode and , like I say , it rans off the edge of the bumps , it's Maur than added quote from being critical . Bigger bombs doing a bit of a jolt , and you do get a bit of noise . Committee of the cabin When he hits like a pothole up manhole cover , it doesn't seem to pummel the bumps in the road into submission like bigger Mercedes , but it's still break . It looks better over pubs in the old car . OK , then what happens when you reach a twisted right ? Well , I'm gonna put the car into sports mode now , so it's gonna wait to this steering , shopping the throttle response and stiffen up that suspension . Does it become a fun car , it seems to grip the road well enough on the steering puts it where you want it to bay . It definitely holds onto the road . Goes pretty good . Maybe , Maybe maybe it doesn't feel like it fits you like a glove . You know something like a box of golf . You just see more in tune with the car . This is almost like going running in someone else's running shoes . Taken , go quickly , but you don't want to push it to the max because you can't really tell what's going on beneath you as a result of the 18 fifties . Just not as much fun to drive as A8 Golf GT I , even though it's essentially supposed to be a whole attach .This particular car has a two litre , turbo charged petrol engine with 224 horsepower . It should be good for naught to 60 in just six seconds . So let's just see how good that is . Stop it . Let's go struggling for grip there . We can't It's pretty quick on . That's the 60 . Did you need to start ? The noise doesn't sound right . This engine . Let's see just how fast the car got from 0 to 60 then well , north to 100 kilometers .That's not too bad . Other engine choices include a nippy 1.4 liter turbo petrol on an economical 1.5 later diesel from launch . All eight classes get a decent seven speed automatic , but manuals will be available at a later date . While most versions of From Will Drive , you can get the A class with Will Drive Team . Plus , there's two lesser equipment levels than this range topping AMG line car . Regardless of your choice , I'm the New Acres is fairly peaceful to travel in .That is , until the ambiance is rudely interrupted by the cause own technology .What would you like to do ?I want you to just shut up . Just shut up . What do you want ? I want you to shut up .Good .So then what's my final verdict ?Well , for me , this new Mercedes A class feels like a genuine Mercedes rather than just a very average car with their three point star just plonked on the front of it that stands out .Is the technology on the interior ? You know , anyone who sits inside this car is gonna love it .

60,81,AMG GT-R,"right at the top of the Mercedes AMG GT family tree . You find this the AMG GT-R . This is the hard core model . This is a big power one . This is track focused . This GT-R is everybody at a M G , squaring up to the guy's a fortune motor sport and saying anything you could do a week do better .GT-R gets stiffer springs and thick anti roll bars as part of a more focused chassis . Set up tracks are wider to increasing stability . Front wings the roof in the prop shaft , oral carbon fibre .But overall , the GT-R is only 15 kilograms lighter than the GTS , or 30 kilograms with this car's optional carbon ceramic brakes . Even so , GT-R weighs more than 1600 kilograms .There's clever , active aero that adds downforce over the front axle , four wheel steering and look how far back in the body the engine sits when Mercedes-Benz , the GT-R front , mid engined , they really mean it . Peak power is 577 BHP , with �516 feet of torque Mercedes-Benz naught to 62 in 3.6 seconds .You join me in the cabin off this mg GT-R . These n GT-R have got such distinctive interiors . I really like him .Actually , you sit low , really low , with a great view forwards . The bonnet is super long , kind of reaches into the next county and you can't actually see where it ends .And then we've got really high transmission tunnel , which makes you feel nice and snug . These two banks of four buttons , They're supposed to look like a V8 engine . Is that class ?You know , I don't know this car . The GT-R has got these fixed back bucket seats , which are actually they're really , really comfortable . I think they're more comfortable than the standard chairs in other GT-R . And , of course , they're really supportive as well . Yeah , it's a really , really cool driving environment list .Do you like this carbon trim here ? There's Matt Carbon , �3000 that costs .That's a hell of a lot of money for a bit carbon trim .This traction control system is important . That's one of the key features of this . GT-R will come back to that when we're on the road .Yeah , it's a really cool Cabaniss , so it looks cool . It's got a great cabin . It's got all sorts of clever kind of race card arrived tech on it .But how does this GT-R actually drive ? We've had all sorts of weather over the last two days , and right now it's shocking it down . It's soaking wet out here . The roads are really , really slippery , but we have had some dry weather , so I can tell you've been about what this car's like driving or conditions . You look at a car like that hard core , track focused model , lots of power , aggressive tires , and you kind of wonder if it's just gonna be completely compromised out on the road . Being completely honest , this car is clearly set up to be its best on a smooth road . I've driven on smooth roads and it feels really , really good . Even when you come into a compression or dips or any of those kind of features in the road . It feels fantastic , really nicely damp .Of course , the engine , it's kind of almost underneath the dashboard , so rather than being nose heavy , it actually feels really , really well balanced .You can see that this is not a smooth road . I'm bouncing about all over the place on the suspension , just doesn't have a pliancy to deal with it . So those bumps and ridges really upset . The cart feels fidgety . It thumps three potholes quite hard . There's some real quality going on with the suspension work here . It's just not really cut out for a difficult road like this one on this car's just not cut out for wet conditions . We've got lots of spring rate . We've got big , thick anti roll bars on . We've got super aggressive Michelin Cup two times . All of which means car in these conditions just doesn't have much grip . And you know what is actually pretty scary ? I don't mind admitting that , but I have driven in the dry and I have to say it feels really , really good dry conditions . You get a series of turning grip from these big wide cup two tires masses traction as well . We've got the gearbox slung out over the rear axle is a transaxle all that way to the gearbox pushes the rear tires intothe twin clutch gearbox works really well with quick , snappy gear shifts .This power train is as effective as it is character ful engine , so to four litre dry , some to be a hot V with the turbos in the V for much sharper response and have to say it's one of the most responsive turbo engines out there . Proper soundtrack . Thunderous V8 background soundtrack to it , over laid with this noisy , popping and banging exhaust , which I should really like , this traction control system is super trick .That's kind of GT-R three racing car technology . You first turn the stability control off completely , and then you can fiddle with the level of intervention . Turn it to the right and you get more intervention . Turn it to the left and you get less intervention and a big crash .The amazing thing about it is you've got nine different increments , and even from one increments the next , you could really feel the difference . Once you find the right level system manages , the power manages to talk . It manages the traction so well that you could put your foot down on the card . Skip did it , did it on drives away from the corner , really ready nicely so it doesn't kill .But it doesn't light up the tires , either . That's really nice . I think we should expect to see this sort of system on other MGs in the future because it works really , really well . The original AMG GT s from a couple of years ago had to be completely honest . Bizarre steering spoke early light , ultra quick . No real sense of connection at all . I just meant that you felt nervous in the car for the 1st 2030 miles . It took a long time to actually get used to it . With this GT-R , they proved it massively . They just calmed it down , taken some of the hyperactivity out a little bit . And so now it's just so much more intuitive . You can start to pour the car into a corner in dry conditions . You feel like you've got a good sense of connection to the front axle . And even though those front wheels are a 1,000,000 miles away , you really felt like you could get right on top of it on the way into a corner . This car's also got rear wheel steering . That's kind of standard across the board for ultra high performance cars these days , and you can feed it working at low speeds at very low speeds . I mean , when you're maneuvering around , you can just feel the rear axle helping the Carter negotiated higher speed , you're not aware of it . I think one of the important things about this car dynamically is that it's kind of got a narrow operating window . So get it on track . We'll get it on a smooth road on a dry road , and it is spectacularly good fun . It feels exciting . It feels raw . It's focused . It's really , really good to drive involving communicative . But when you get it on a bumpy road , and when it starts raining , it's just out of its depth that it stops working and then actually becomes a proper handful .Here comes the inevitable 9 11 GT-R three comparison .The thing about the GT three is that it doesn't have a narrow operating window , even on similar Cup two tires . It feels driveable in the wet , and it works on a bumpy roads . And , of course , it's fantastic on a circuit or on a dry road as well . There are some important ways in which this GT-R is better and more exciting and more dramatic than a GT three .It's got more power , so feels faster .I think it looks more dramatic .I think it's got a more interesting cabin , but as a driving device that GT three has still got his nose in front .AMG deserves boundless respect for getting into this kind of hard core performance car space . Not many people have actually done that . They really Ferrari with 45 Especially perhaps , but that costs twice as much as 11 .Jeezy A3 GT-R A3 has kind of gone off challenge for years and years and years . But finally someone has come along a n g has come along and had a proper crack it in . That takes nerve . You've got to respect him for that . Hopefully this battle between AMG and portion might spoil is gonna go on and on . I cannot wait ."
61,82,AMG CLS 53,"welcome them to the inside off a Mercedes AMG C . L s 53 Mercedes AMG 53 . Sell it 50 . It's the new Mercedes C . Let's welcome inside it . It's a 53 because it's not a 43 which is a halfway house , AMG . But it's not a 63 which is the full fat AMG . This is a 53 . The significance of that is that this is not just a new C . L s . This is a brand new Mercedes-Benz MG powertrain . It introduces a MG to the world of hybrids or introduces hybrids to the world of a MG . And that's the most significant thing this new car aside .Well , come to the new car that let's deal with this new powertrain first , because it's really complicated . Two B s mers The boss off AMG loves of V8 . Probably a proper car blow . You'd like him . I like it . It's good . Noel Kahrs Canepa V8 Noel AMG scamper V8 because they're thirsty . Allowed there . So in the world's gotta get Big Green , hasn't it ? I suppose so . Anyway , they're juicy , sort of halfway house AMG models the 43 which is a three liter inline six with a bit more potent than usual , this new 53 model is moved on from that a bit again . It has a three liter inline six cylinder engine petrol engine , which is very smooth because inline six under engines are naturally perfectly balanced . But on top of that , it has one twin scroll turbocharger two on electric compressor Electric Turbo . If you want to call that electric supercharger , if you want to give it that name , that primary there to fill the talk gap in the turbo lag from the turbocharger . But then also on top of that , it also has what they call Ik ik . U Books don't want point to the back . It's actually in between the engine and the gearbox . The E Q . Is hey started about two slash alternator . It adds another 20 or horse power to the engines 425 or so , but it also adds some �120 for a talk , which is a lot . Anyway , all of those three things combined , and it's really complicated this right because the air goes in , it goes around against through the turbo charger , but then it could get sucked down by the electric compressor before it's even gone through the normal thing and it comes back just It's complicated , right ? Some companies you would trust to get that right . I think Mercedes-Benz M5 the time it's gone through all of that . It's gone through the boost e electric bit as well , then drives through a nine speed automatic gearbox primarily to the rear wheels , and it goes to the front wheels when they lose grip . I got it , but I'm still not entirely sure I've got it . But anyway , what that means is tha .This is an AMG , but it's not the fire breathing V8 AMG off this new C L s , which is , As you all know , the third generation company from the third generation of this car already is the e class based . So it's a big saloon , but it's amore Cupid's e class , if you like .Some still got four doors . They are frameless , and it's got a very swoopy roof line .It's got lower re flying in the back , so it's not a spacious inside and smaller , not spacious inside as an e class , but it's about the same size .It's just call up more stylish now , in previous times , there's Bean a proper V8 AMG version of it . You won't get one this time because AMG is also introducing its own stand alone Ford or model called the GT four , which is based on , rather than being based on the aluminium architecture that sits underneath the GT-R .The GT four . Despite Stew Winkle GT-R will have Mercedes-Benz R8 form , which is this is on the E classes on s class is also gone . So anyway , that will be the big four door GT-R hoop A8 ish thing .Then there's the E class , which retains its 63 V8 . Then there is the C L s , which now the most amg X1 is this ? Got that ? I'm still not sure I got that , but we'll get there .What's it like inside ? It's really lovely . Actually , I really like this . It's made out of really beautifully constructed materials .It feels great above executive car pushing towards luxury car stuff as I suppose it might cause this they haven't announced price for it yet , but it's gotta be 65 70 grand marshal thing .But what I really like these beautiful little events that look like so a turbine blades and the fact they've got this little led in the middle , which shines out and then in low light conditions . It just reflects and glints off . Really , really thoughtful .Nicely done . Get three different types off suspension on C . L . S in general . Not necessarily 53 a . M . G in particular , but you could get standard steel springs . Then there's adaptive , damp steel springs on . Then there are springs , which this has got , so it rides very well , Really controlled , really need me . Doesn't really suffer their sort of sprawling . Some air sprung cars do right that that bump there really nicely . Steering is nice , too . It's direct . It's accurate . It's not lows of feeling . Feedback on every reason . A big executive car . This is a large car . Don't forget , just on this nice stretch of road turns with nice agility , and it's got just enough , I think character . It's no kind of full AMG if you want to consider it like that , but it is a pleasing car to drive now .What I have not noticed so far is that it sounds particularly a mg ish , so let's put the gearbox through into manual well there's a little there .It's quiet , it's refined , it's really smooth .Is a six courses . It's also turbo charged , so that does dampen noise of things . Sometimes it's not a snarly V8 like AMG S4 lead to Twin Turbo . So this is not then the full fact AMG experience , and you're not gonna get that in a C . L s , which I think maybe is a bit of a shame . But we'll see how the GT four works out .They are expensive GT-R for is to meantime , they have expanded what AMG means so that it no longer means just anger , fire breathing , V8 e It also now means this smooth , semi sporting , sophisticated field . Does that undermine the MG brand ? I don't think it does . Actually , I think it just just about those enough this guy to go yet I'm quite good fun , quite like me . I've got a bit of a sporting edge , but actually quite easy to live with day today as well . Quite a lot of time for that"
62,83,AMG GT C ,"Hello . You join me inside . A nice car is an AMG GT T C roadster . So what's that ? Well , the AMG GT . You will know it is a two seats , mostly aluminium sports car made exclusively for AMG Mercedes . There's no known AMG now . This car is , as the rest of it suggests , a soft top version . This is the new launch . This is a new car .It's the soft top Scott . This folding roof goes down electrically in 11 seconds at up to 30 miles an hour , and I could tell you he's really well insulated . It's quite nice with the roof down . Probably do with the over the roof jacket . You won't hear a word I say .Is it a softer option than a regular Cooper ? Well , argument usually goes that it is because you lose torching rigidity , you add . Wait high up in the chassis . So if you're thinking about , say , abortion 9 11 convertible , I think that's perceived . Is less of a sports car less of a pure sports car , and I'm not letting keeping .I don't get my impression . I've been trying this car for a couple of hours . There's never been a single ship from that rearview mirror to suggest that this body show is anything other than really , really stiff . The ride is composed . Really .Steering is good . You know . You don't get any inconsistencies because of because of chassis flexor .Until that on , like all AMG GTS , it's powered by It's really spectacular , really spectacular S4 V8 way the home .It's just brilliant . It's just a really lovely engine , right ? So complication continues .So what is this sea ? Well , there is a base am GT-R . Then there is a S model . And then there is the our model , which is the most powerful , as you could think of . Think of that if you like . As the 9 11 GT-R three of the AMG GT Range A7 GT-R 73 76 base models got about 470 X6 got about 500E . R8 got quite a lot more than that . This sits between the S on the arm . That's what sea does . Funny letter , isn't it ? For that ? I wouldn't have thought that sea is a natural letter to do that sort of thing very well . There we go .What it gets is Elektronik Lee controlled limited slip differential off the S But it also gives the active rear stairs from our gets a wider rear track from the R8 .So I guess that kind Americana Grill So it looks like our does . So it looks the business it sounds .Business goes really fast on because this is no this sort of softer version of an AMG in the way that Jackie Reptile or fortunately liberties compared to Cooper doesn't feel to me . So it's kind of better to think of it in some ways , as the name would suggest , as a GT-R slightly easier going than a lout sports car kind of machine . If you do think of this GTC Lila at the GDC Roads . Riveting , I think , actually , in soft top form , this car really starts to come of age . I think this is terrific like this .It makes a brilliant noise .Gearboxes Super ride is composed .Body Shell does not feel fluffy in the slightest , I think , actually is a really sweet spot in the AMG GT range , and I have a feeling that this occupies it"
63,84,S Class,"This is the new Mercedes s class . Now you might not think it looks all that new , but it is . It's heavily , heavily revised , says .Got a whole host of new technology .It's got a new range of more efficient engines , and it's got some styling upgrades .So , you know , I get the big girl like you did on the V 12 . It's on . All models need bumpers at the front and the back on this new headlight design . So the S class gets these A3 any D eyebrow effects that he got us to . The secrets has worn to show their stunning in the range . You could think of it as being like , Look there one eyebrow . That's the C Class two eyebrows . That's the e class M3 eyebrows . That's the S class definitely works better on the car .Now the S class starts in �72,000 . You click it , they're gonna co dot co dot uk and compare office . Make sure you're not paying too much because even if you can afford one of these , you're gonna want some money for some options because there's loads . If you spend next three grand , I get the long wheel base versions . But let's remain in the front of us what it's like for the driver .Well , it's nice . It's very , very , very nice in here . I really like the design . So I think the design is more interesting than that you get with the new Audi A8 . Yeah , it's just great on Dhe . I like it in this color tone is what it is really good . This two tone kind of beige and brown . What's not quite good ? I think Z8 is overall quality . Meats is brilliant , but that's that seems a bit flimsy . Maybe a just a little bit more robust . Maybe slightly better . Neighbor , it's splitting hairs .Yeah , you really relaxing here .Now you get loads of standard kit , obviously , with the S class that around parking sensors , climate control and satellite navigation these two huge digital screens which are really , really crisp and sharp . What's new on this revised s class , though , is this steering wheel . So before usedto have the controls for the cruise control here on the stock , which is a bit Gailey now it's been shifted appear .You can also control this screen using this touch pad here so I can cycle through different menus and dials . There's got the sack nervous . I could switch it across , then go through the different displays there as well . If I want , I can control this display with this touch pad here . It's all right to use , but I'd rather use the swivel wheel , even though it's a bit awkward and ungainly with touchpad thing over the top . So it's a bit like you or s I . But it's all right to use on infotainment system is pretty good in this car . I don't is quite as good as that in the BMW seven series . The I Drive is still the best , but I prefer it in the touch screen system you get in the new Audi A8 . I think Audi have made a mistake with that . Prefer the swivel worlds to tell you the truth Now , if you can't get there , you can see my fault . In that video review of the infotainment system , I have another good look around the cost cabin in terms of storage .Yeah , it is . Look , that opens that way , but it also opens . Why ? It's really clever . You got some cup holders . Hey , it is a place for you , Kay . You also have decent sized door Benz really important in this class . It will take a bottle of champagne . The glove box is rather small . There's this thing in it . Look like there again . It's a scent so you can have like fragrance is wafting through the cabin . This one is called free side Mood , whatever that means . So this character has a wellness function , which you can press a button . It remembers the kind of settings that you like a little to the amount of air freshener going into the car in the different seating positions and stuff like that . You can also alter the led lighting that you get shining through here and here I go it on purpose , the moment which is a bit burlesque . But you can also change through a wide range of colors in the 64 in total . So yeah , lots to choose from . Now let's move on to the boot .So it's it's big enough , right ? This is a saloon car . You got a nice wide opening since not too difficult to load . One thing you can't do , though , is fall down the rear seats . If you want to carry really longer items . If you want a luxury car that is pretty good for carrying lots of stuff , you might want to get rid of it like a rain driver in stakes in the come fall down the seats . You did have some more storage under here . There's plenty of space under there . Actually , there's also a couple of netted off areas there to keep smaller items secure . Now , if you click up there , you can watch my detail practicality , video on this car . See how much you can stuff into its boot .How is it is to fit a child sees what it's like in the back seat . But let's find out now , shall we ? Because that's really important on this car , especially as it's the long wheelbase version . So , yes , look at this . It's very sumptuous here , making it the car with a bench in the back if you need to carry three . But this two seater version is much better than a press this button here and put the car into full first class mode while it's doing its thing , even the sea .Either way , I want to show you this . You got a little cubby in there . Here . You got a couple of cup holders now really like this . If you've got a cold drink , you can press his button and it will kill it . Or , if you've got a hot drink , put it in their press the button again .And l hate it now , as you can see the chairs moving out of the way , and it's going to seem pretty cool in a moment like newts thing . It's not the fastest . Come on , say it is that's reclining my chest and get nice and comfy . I've also got this interest pillows absolutely glorious , and I look at my legs . It's raising up . Ah , this'd is the way you , on a travel on a little bit , extends its footstool at the back of the seat in front . Now all have to do is shut the blinds , and then I could not off , because , after all , car reviewing is very , very tiring work .Now you know what this car is like on the inside . Let's find out how it drives now , this class , maybe a big car , but it's surprisingly easy to drive in town . Potter . Reason for that is a staring . It's nice and light which makes no speed maneuvers , a doddle also visible .It is really good . So that's how many blind spots you got . Big back windows . There's a good V8 the back on . I like the fact that the Mercedes emblem kind of acts like a gun sight to a mere down the road .There's a suspension , so this car rides on standard fit air suspension on its It's really nice and smooth and waffle . There is one thing that you do notice that when you hit a very sharp bump or Pato , you just need a bit of a shock through the cabin . If you want more information , what this car's like to drive , click it thereto . Watch my point of view test drive video . Now , as you speed up and get out on the motorway , the air suspension really does come into its own . It just it just floats his car down the road . It's always like you're flying just above the surface . It really deals well without undulations . It's it's glorious , and you can assume the classic Mercedes-Benz caste driving position , which is just like this , because it's just very , very relaxing .The reason for that is the same briefing . So let me get to 70 . There we go . So I'm now doing 70 .It's just it's just very , very quiet .And the next thing to mention is this engine . So the Mercedes s class gets a new range of engines , and I've got a straight 62.9 litre diesel in this car , you get into power Act puts . This is the lower perversion with 286 horsepower , but lower power . It does not feel that's all . It's a very strong engine of the not 60 in just six seconds on . Look at this , right . If I go to about 40 miles an hour , plant my right foot . Look at that speed build . I am now doing 70 . It's effortless , and it doesn't even sound like a diesel . And it's smooth , almost like a petrol . University says It will do over 50 odd miles per gallon , and I'm actually averaging 38.6 . That's really , really good for a car this size . You can , of course , get a straight 63 litre petrol engine turbo , and that's north sixth in under five seconds . It's really , really lovely and of course , is V8 in the a M G versions , which is just bonkers . Fast be that we need them into the gearbox . All cars get a seven speed auto , and it's really smooth . On slick . You can control the get yourself using the paddles , but you wouldn't ask . So why bother ? You know , let it do the work for you . Nothing worth noting is that you can get the cart with all wheel drive . It's not standard like it is on the new Audi A8 .Now , once you move off the motorway and then on the twisty road , the S class doesn't let you down there either . So the flick of a switch , I can put it into sport mode . There we go . And it stiffens that the suspension starts the body roll on for a big car , actually goes around corners really well . And maybe now I will use the paddle shift us so I could get Maur involved in experience . What really helps it is that steering what ? It was nice and light when going slowly . Now it's got weight to it and give you a lot of confidence . I don't think your V I p in the back would like you're driving like this . But if you haven't got anyone to chauffeur around , you can actually have a bit of fun in class . But what about if you don't want to be so involved with the driving ? No problem . The S class is upgraded . Cruise control system can help .Clever , active control system . Well , read the road ahead and it'll steer to keep you in lane . Look , there we go . It's staring automatically by Shouldn't take a hands off for too long and it will disengage in Los a key You a safe distance from the car in front will automatically break if the car in for interview breaks and he'll do it right down to a standstill so that I'm breaking . Now look , my feet . Look , I know you're on the pedals , but the conference stops . So too will my s class . There we go . If he moves away again , it should start to move away . Come on . Car , I presume . Off weekend . Another neat trick is that the car were actively slow for things like told booze , you have a change of speed limit on dhe .If you're approaching something like around about it , that's just relaxing .This is Look the system will even change lanes view on the motorway . All you have to do is use its indicator to let it know which way you want to overtake . The car will automatically make the maneuver if it's safe to do so .However , know everything about the S class is good . Here's five annoying things about it .In right hand drive versions of the S class , the steering wheel is little bit offset . But unless they feel a bit twisted behind the wheel , you see the still well , really should be about here . But no , it's here . For some reason , you don't get re a privacy glass as standard .It's a �345 option , which is a little bit odd on a car such as this , because , yes , I'm just too rich to be seen as part of the middle I facelift .Mercedes is gonna make the fake exhaust even Maur face . I mean , you really do think that's a proper tailpipe of this diesel cover ? Actually , the real exhaust for it is under their shop bottoms .These real displays may look like tablets , but you can't operate them by touch , which seems a bit ridiculous when you're so close to them and said you have to use a control . So I'm gonna press the button on the controller .This just seems ridiculous that hey , absolutely love these airplane style work tables . They just feel glorious and very expensive . The only problem is , is that if you put your laptop on their your bit of a keyboard basher like me , your laptop bounces around all over the place , and then you end up writing a load of gobbledygook on better presented in writing .Don't worry , there's still plenty to like about this car . Is the car wow A5 Cool features mortar being led .Headlights are as bright as a headlight is legally allowed to be , and they can shy to 650 meters of the road . Prepare to be blinded .You could get a wireless charging dock for your mobile phone here in the back seat . And if you really own battery , but you need to make a call , you can use this blue team concept . It's that , Yeah , yeah , there's no one there just acting .If you get the s class with magic body control cameras can read the road ahead . And if they spot bums . They'll lift the suspension up to smooth out the bumps . Or so with the curve to function , the coal actually leading to a bend like a motorcycle to aid the handling . Yeah , call . While we've got the best camera special effects .The new Carter Ex Technology allows Mercedes-Benz to talkto remember toward of Traffic Jones but also accident black spots . So it's a little bit like ways for your mobile phone , but better .This class is a 48 volt electrical system , which is more than four times that . You get on a normal car and it needs the extra power in order to run all the Gatica you can get on this car . It also drives a compressor which blows air into the turbo charges . He can instant response from the engine , and I'll show you where it is now . It's just somewhere . I have no idea what's going on into that put up . You always said that I had to fit either .Yeah , take a look up there on the link below the video . You got a car y dot co dot uk to see the best deals you can get on the Mercedes s class . So they want a verdict on the car . Should you avoid it , should he consider it ? Should you shortly stay ? Or should you just go right ahead and buy it ? Well , I reckon you should short list the Mercedes s class . It really is a very good luxury liver . Z8 . Enjoy this video , please . Like it . Show it on .

64,85,63 AMG,"way .Mercedes-Benz 63 S8 amg Mercedes His answer to the BMW X6M Porsche Cayenne Turbo on the Range Rover Sport s V R . Now lots of people get very hot under the collar about the prospect of making a 2.3 ton , five meter SUV entered something remotely sporting . But let's face it , they sell really well these cars and so Mercedes-Benz to make a really good job of it .It doesn't feel like an AMG God say it doesn't actually . I mean , the engine is a real star in this . This car gets the five and 1/2 liter bi turbo V8 that we're now familiar with from a lot of the 63 a . M . Jeez , this s gets 500E A7 A7 brake horse power . And trust me , it's flipping fast . 4.2 seconds to 62 . So , actually , for those you care about A4 X3 are on the road . He's got so much talk . I mean , it really has that .You've just got epic acceleration complete with seven speed talking about gay box No . Nine speed that you do get in the new A4 50 g l e , which gets the V six by turbo .It's also 30 grand chief , with 4 50 63 so back have been interesting . 1 may be the better by before .Driving this car actually is a permanent system you sent to the front and 60% back , so it's no active like in a Porsche Cayenne or anything like that . But it's pretty good .Actually , I have to say handling is a little bit this pointing all the steering is quite good . It's got lots of precision . There's no massive amount of feedback . Sometimes make corner . You have a bit more , a bit more . Bite to it . More .It's the fact that it doesn't have the adjustability that you would get in a can turbo on rain drug recipe . R8 more go hard into a corner . Just understand ? Sure . I mean , it's absolutely chucking it down at the moment , which is , but you just don't get back really enjoying those , although you know you can't really , really booted into spoke very aggressive , and it could be quite Stanley .You've got various different modes on the air suspension , which is standard . It does seem to be quite firm . I think it might be a little bit fidgety , perhaps not that comfortable in the UK over really bad roads , but having said that , it's a 63 AMG .I think one of the best things about this car is really quiet .You just want to get home in peace .More like this , just like about this car interiors . Really nice .The engines Fantastic Game Box Bay , A little bit hit and miss sometimes when it's in auto mode is much better in manual mode . If you really want to drive it hard . Normal driving . It's pretty good . Actually .If I had 96 that's called 100 K , but I buy it . I run in the other sports SUVs , I think being a can or a Range Rover .But sell this car way . No , I am really Don't make a sound good . Oh , my God , this sounds good ."
65,86,AMG GT-R,"go . Welcome to the interior Mercedes-Benz mg GT-R , just a master of the two Mercedes AMG GT .It's pretty nice here isn't actually a cz a swell in my Benz �110,000 coop . A8 kinda replaces the SL s , but it is a lot cheaper than that , a bit more usable .It's a more rounded GT-R arrival , if you like , for some of the top end portion 9 11 such as the GTS . And there are a couple of things I want to know well of one , which is quicker , too , which is more fun .The weight distribution of this because it has seven speed transact , also get boxes in the back exit , slide to the rear as well , and it's got 500E A3 .425 is a 3.8 2nd car to 60 on the 9 11 is a 4.4 S60 .But price and speed , as we know , do not equal driving pleasure . So let's put the systems in what we're supposed to put them in and say , which is the bigger giggle ? What's it like ?A little but quite quite interesting track called Landau in Wales , some of the old character of architecture .It's a bit smaller , but it's being revised and updated . But it doesn't get .All of this can tell you is it does not want A4 place and it doesn't .He's very forgivable . Playful gave boxes even good enough . You could just upshift drift without upsetting the balance . There are hot radish elements to steer is quite responsive . Call it even though it's light , it's gone . It's very direct .Don't show up .Feel through it . In a way , there's a little bit of a wagon load .Riggs . So much talk as well .S7 was careful about that .Everything was gonna be , Oh , you don't really need to pay the sort of rocks as it goes in and out of that out , right ? Finish the best sports girl . Just just wait in other sports .All right , so this is the 9 11 GTS GTS versus GTS , and it's , um , it feels like getting back into a company .Bearable . Trainers just get anything . Friends .It's smaller . It's lighter . Not actually think 1500 verses with 70 .But if you want to know what the big differences between fundamentally engine wise between this on the AMG AMG has got about 480 foot pounds , and it comes in from 17 50 . Talking there something X3 G20 A5 and it comes in 57 50 . That's what having a naturally aspirated engine way back way , listen to you just because it's naturally aspirated . What response it really is something else steering heavier .But this field is just really glorious steering system A6 Just enjoy driving on .It's a very good actually .It's a pleasingly usable thing .On the course is the fact that it looks $1,000,000 .Sounds absolutely incredible .Everywhere you go , societies is more of an event .It's got a nicer in Syria .In many ways . I suspect you'd love to own one to come out of house and see in the morning .I'll make something that looks and sounds like it does .If it comes , Del Terri fundamentally dynamically gives you engineering field back , just sheer driving .There is just something good"
66,87,AMG E 63 S,"now I like fast cars as much as the next man more than the next man . But does there come a point where the wider world has a little sore lotus counter moment ? Even remember that the world turned around and said , Does the planet really need an executive saloon car that could do 175 miles an hour ? Well , here we are in 2016 . On This is the new Mercedes AMG E 63 S4 Matic full title on DDE .In blunt terms , eyes an executive saloon with 600 force power That could do , if you take my options 196 Mongols an hour .That's quite a lot , isn't it ?I've been in simplistic terms . It's an AMG , but don't think it's just got a big engine . Lots of it's actually rather more sophisticated than that .Yes , at the front of it is a four litre twin turbo charged V8 , making 603 break , �627 Fertile . It's got two twin scroll turbo , so each turbos scroll only to basically what that means is there's less turbo drive through a nine speed automatic gearbox . It's got a wet clubs rather than a talking better . But it's not your clutch . And on the back of that back that pushes power forwards just to make this car for we'll drive up to 50 50 from split Normally . Now it's just really drunk . But all in those changes me that this car weighs 1955 kilograms , which is quite a lot , which is why it needs 600 which is why it could do naught to 60 in a frankly supercar troubling A3 . And there are a few things that look in here as well .I like the latest generation in class . I like the interior , this carbon fiber do any carbon in a car that weighs basically two guns . Anyway , these new dash layers are particular actually great , massive big screen in the middle . But I M G says , Why would you have digital space if they just gonna do exactly what the old ones do ? So they've redesigned them to make them look a bit more . I don't know , a little bit dart board for my taste , but they are largely pretty clear anyway that sits behind a wheel that I'd rather was around but he's a really meaty F40 weight to it on the road , pleasing , actually , just really accurate .The season . Terrific . It's it's It's an enjoyable car . You could sit back , relax .You can enjoy it , but it's quite firmly controlled big , too , for some reason , the UK even on it's softer settings . But what exactly can you do on the road in the way he uses a car like this on the track ? Well , no , we used to run track days of all Take our On one evening , a bloke turned up in his dad's M5 A3 , �10.1 completely redid . The dyers had a great time drive again . But apart from that , I haven't seen big Executive Saloon girls like this on a circuit very often making so I can go on , even if it comes from a break said you wanted . So let's go to a circuit and find out what this is like , whether it is really worth going toe all of that trouble .I think it's a race mode because , of course , all two ton saloon cars go racing straight away .I tell you , this card gets on a bit . It is fast , serious circuit this Look , Grady int laser cambers .If any track is gonna test it , is this one really good balance to it ?It was amazing shelf for 1980 kilos , just astonishingly agile . I don't have that done that . I mean , that's really quick . It breaks sensationally . Well , somebody else has already been out in this car on the way . You wouldn't know it off . Really agile schatzi . Okay , I'm starting to think maybe I should take back everything I said about this because it's so good . It's really , really , really good fun on that job . Stability has on the trouble because it's mostly driving . Makes it very odd . Troubles very stable . Should you wanted to say I say , Should you want it to me ? Because there is a single drift , both levers , I can have drift mode , which means basically disconnects the front axle . Oh , how good is that ? And then well , I think it becomes 63 . You kind of what ? All the time , which is just into a secret . I don't really want to be Oh so good , So much smoke . It's got so much , it's got so much talk . If you just want to push it sideways . I know it's childish .It's just a big , massively powerful talking V8 ringing in your ears circuit .Sensational . I can't believe I can't believe a car that weighs this much . You can do that stuff on on the road back relaxed .Does the world really need a $600 ? About 196 miles an hour ?Teutonic executive . Silly . Of course it doesn't . I'm glad the world is cold ."
67,88,GLA,"This is the Mercedes G L . A . And it's effectively a Mercedes , a class which has been jacked up by just over two inches , which may not sound like much . But if I myself up by over two inches , I'm now nicely over six foot tall and therefore infinitely more desirable , so I should get a lot more like snow on the dating websites .You do have to pay for this extra desirability . So like for like it's about four and 1/2 grand ball than the A class . But then the G L A . Does get all wheel drive as standard . If you click up there to get a car , why dot co dot uk ? You can compare office from dealers and buy a price your confidence in on average , people say �3600 on a new car through car .Wow , Now you'll see that for an SUV . It's not actually that tall because Mei and five foot 11 ish can actually look over the top of this car . But I do like the look of this car , especially the back end . I think it's really stylish .Speaking of which , if I open the boot , the capacity on this car is about 40% greater than on the equivalent a class , so there's more room for all your luggage . There's also High Lady Lola to lift a favor on it because it's a massive load , which is really annoying . Under here , you've got some under floor storage , which is Handley . There's cubby spaces here at the size . You got tethering points , 12 volt socket ski hatch . Also , when I fall down the seats and you will see they like completely flat , So it's a nice , flat usable load area . Also , this car has an automated tell gate .Now let's move on to the back seats because well , here in the rear . Now , to put these in place in a straight how much room we've got here , which actually is a lot better than the A class . So Head Room's pretty decent . So's Nero , and people over six foot will be fine here in the back . Now , the problems that children might not like it all that much because the windows are quite small on these integrated headrest . They they stopped the view forward , so it does feel a little bit claustrophobic and dark and dingy back here . Another slight issue with this car is that while the foot walls are pretty small and the body is pretty narrow , so it's not that great for carrying three in the back at once , and BMW X1 is way better Now , if you click up there , you can actually watch . I have detailed practicality review and see what it's like . Three people in the back , how easy it is to fit a child , See , and just how much stuff we could fit in this car's boot .And speaking of practicality , actually , there are some nice features in this car . I love these pop act cup holders that's cool on the door bins in the back as well . They can hold a one liter bottle of water . This move to the front of the car . You say coming spaces throughout this gel A8 are pretty decent . Yes , so the front door bins can hold way bigger than this , Actually , or so the glove box . It's a reasonable size . There's also some more storage under here , and a couple of us be inputs for the entertainment system .Speaking of which , well , it's okay to use , but I do find that in the BMW X1 slicker . This car has the midlevel satnav , so it's by Garmin , and it does look a little bit cheap . A4 you'd expect for a car of this price point . Nothing like that . There you can actually see our full in debt video review of the entertainment system .Have another look around this cost coming and you'll see that actually , the interior design is pretty sporty . I do like the look of it . It's very similar to the A8 class , actually on , just like the class , it does feel a little bit cheap in places . I mean the materials down here out yet they certainly don't pass the car y flick test .Now , though , it's time to hit the rail to see what the G . L . A is like to drive now . Like I said at the beginning , this review the G L . A . Is based on the A class , but I do find it better to drive now . The main reason for that is that you've got jacked up suspension on that makes this car more comfortable on . That matters a lot because the A class is a little bit too for riding . I think so , as you move up the range , you do get sported suspension , which is firmer on bigger wheels , and that does start to impair the right quality somewhat . So just be aware of that on . There's not really a trade off in terms of handling the sport . Your card . While the supposedly sporting guards they don't really go around corners any better part . The problem for this is the fact that the steering it just doesn't feel that good . You can't tell what the front wheels are doing . You're just gonna do the will of another slight issue .His noise . You get a lot of war from the tires . There's about with noise rubber . It's not such a problem .And then there's the visibility . So this swooping pillar , which makes a college sporty , does kind of get close to your head , and it creates a bit of a blind spot there . The worst thing is this small rear window . You've got huge , rare pillars , and it can be a bit apparently pulling into junctions .Now , if you click up there , you can join me for 360 degree passenger I video and see for yourself so you can get the jelly with the choice of petrol and diesel engines , I'd avoid the 1.6 liter . Petrol is a little bit slow when you can't get it with an automatic gearbox , nor for will drive if you want it . This is the 2 50 petrol , which actually to Leeds and Du Nord 16 6.6 seconds . It's pretty quick on you get four wheel drive . I don't know automatic gearboxes standard . And I like the auto . I'm not a big fan of Mercedes-Benz . Yes , actually , economy is supposed to be around 43 miles per gallon . But if I look at the tree computer , I'm getting Justin .People want a diesel on dhe . The entry level 200 day is pretty gonna be good enough for most people .And it'll help you save on price as well because it doesn't come with an automatic gearbox standard nor four wheel drive .You can speak it up if you want to , but really , are you gonna need from well driving this car ? No , no , no , you don't .As with all cars , the D . L . A is a mixture of good and bad .So here are five million things about this Mercedes-Benz trim down here so sharp you can even shave a tweak with it .You can't quite fit the parcel shelf under the false floor .I like the idea . Q3 the G l A doesn't have supportive gas trucks . Tell me open the bonnet is a bit of a workout . Yes .And for that you can't get a delay with such a wide choice of engines as you can with the A class .I think Mercedes-Benz the top of the dash get up in the door because it looks a little bit well . It was built for a different car That does give you somewhere to store my ball phone .However , it's not all bad news . Here are five cool features about the G L .A little clips mean that the seat belts don't snag on the receipts when you fold them down .The correspondent torturously pops up in the event of an accident to help protect pedestrians . But when it was tested by your cap in 2014 got one of the highest scores for adult occupant protection in the crash test .You get the car with downhill speed regulation perfect for easy down that steep ramp of the multi storey car park . Exposed S6 anchor points make it much easier to locate the child seat , high level parking distant guide lights really useful when he tried to reverse .Now , if you could get there , you got a car while dot co dot uk to get more information on save an average of �3900 on a new G l A .So that overall , my verdict on this car should do avoid it should he consider it ? Should you shortly step , or should I just go ahead and buy it ? Well , I reckon you should consider the G l .It's a good looking car is just a little bit compromised in places .Thanks for watching entered this video , please like it and show it and click on the car while I go to subscribe to our channel . You've become the video windows you can watch detail , practicality , three entrances to degree passenger ride and full indebted a review for the Mercedes G . L . A .

68,89,A 45 AMG,"considering it's one of the fastest real world cars that money could buy it . The all new Mercedes A 45 A m G has , for whatever reason , slipped under the radar . But here's what sort of car we're talking about .355 years , thanks to the world's most powerful two litre four cylinder engine , 0 to 60 in 4.64 wheel drive , a seven speed dual clutch gearbox on dhe . Get this acclaimed fuel economy figure the right side off 40 mpg .In theory , it's quite some card in the A 45 mg , even if it does cost a somewhat disturbing 37 grand , right ?Well , that's the theory .But what is 355 horsepower , if you like on a close on a track well festival , I gotta turn everything off because it's three stage his P A system , which they say , definitely , the car handles better when it's off . I've got a manual gear change , right ?That's this is a fantastic track , basically designed to replicate the Nurburgring , and it was designed by the government . Yes , a bloke that does all the Formula One circuit .Okay , there's a bit of understeer We'd expect that back to go out of that corner . Lots and lots of go in that corner , a little bit of oversteer . If you just back off a little bit , which is actually quite nice , you could just use that to your advantage . You get it to turn in , get it to turn . It probably behaved like an absolute idiot . This is the bit that's freaky .Oh , it's got proper traction . Well , it's , uh , I love the steering in this new A8 45 is pure , really precise , and you can properly muck about with tail end as well once you've got hold of stuffed dog . Okay , that's a horrible little corner , but it actually feels really good through there because the front end just nailed . It was really nice .That was interesting . What overcooked it ? A teeny bit there , and I just touch the brakes and assumes I touch the brakes . Everything came back in the system . That's their That's that's mental gearbox doesn't quite work fast enough . You asking for down change ? Say you're doing 4004 . I'm going down there . It's no giving it to me , which is just but behind Lee .It's seriously quick as well . This thing .It's a proper little pocket rocket needing to cut Zack , Calm down , suddenly drive the car . Probably what we actually feeling it do Here is just a bit of understeer when you get back on the power , but not much . What I cannot feel anywhere around the back is the rear axle playing an awful of how much of a role in it . It just feels a bit passive , really . It feels like a really , really well sorted from wheel drive car .The brakes are still absolutely there after three or four laps of the track , which is impressive . Um , I like handling balance . It's not amazing , but I do . You like it ?This engine just strong ways .1550 kilograms .I think you could tell you what when you when you're really chucking it around during the big direction changes , you can feel everyone every last one of those kids . But look , this is a road car . We're on a completely mental race track road . Castor's never feel fat great around tracks . This one feels pretty good to me , and the best thing about honey is the motor .It's really strong .The motor on the steering . I love both of those .So having driven it mostly loved it . On one of Europe's more insane new race tracks , I spent a bit more time with the A 45 . I think it's shown even more brightly than away from a tracking out on the public road . It feels even faster , both the right and steering it deeply impressive , too , as is the car as a whole .To be honest , the big test sensation in a 45 will come in a couple of times when we compare it on UK roads , back to back with BMWs and 135 on VW's need Gulf GT-R with performance pack and destiny .So until then ."
69,90,500E,"state's history lesson is a compelling one because the Mercedes 500E is a car with a serious legacy . When it first hit the streets back in 1991 this V8 powered E class was an expensive , rare groove car , and it sold in tiny numbers . But subsequently it became the template for an entire generation of high powered . Beside these products , cars like the C . L S60 3 a.m. g . They were introducing it to hear . Now nearly two decades divide these two cars , but the fundamentals are very similar .Both have got big V8 engines delivering serious performance on both also offer effortless driving experiences for the big question for today is just how close in the 500E get to its modern equivalent .Now I'm not going to claim to be dispassionate observer here because I've always been a huge fan of W 1 to 4 generations e class Ondas the brawny ist The 500E should be the best of the bunch , but it was never that much of a cell success .Thanks in large part to a 58 grand price tag back in 91 you could buy a BMW M5 for �12,000 less with in return for their considerable investment .Buyers got most of the mechanical package of the 500 SL stuffed into any class body shell . The star attraction was the five litre V8 , putting out 326 horsepower . Now that's not a huge amount by modern standards , but back in the day , only the lotus count and stop this from being the most powerful saloon car in the world .The call was made from the saviors by port In Zutphen . House looks like a standard 300D substantial changes under the skin , including all new front section on the most obvious difference . Being extended well , R8 on the road , it still feels brilliant .The steering is absolutely brimming with feedback . It feels like a completely different car compared to a standard e class from the period . Now , the four speed automatic transmission is a little bit dull witted , but once you found the engine up , it still feels properly fast . This was the first Mercedes-Benz fitted as standard with ASR traction control . Now , unfortunately , you can't turn it off , which does rather live in the amount of fun you could have on a nice open cornice driving the C . L s . It's clear that there was a very direct lineage between these two cars .Both have got similarly meaty steering on , both very refined , considering the amount of performance on offer now in the last two decades , that happens fairly major changes this car absolutely stuffed with Tek everything from a seven speed gearbox to seat that squeeze you when you start to go fast around corners . There's one crucial difference , though .Despite all the safety gear , DSP stability control system in the C . L s can't be turned off , of course , crucial differences that C .L s has got a 6.2 liter V8 500E A7 horsepower . That's almost 50% more 500E house . So how much quicker is it ?Well , to find out , we've organized on in from to drag race Now it lost the traffic like grown pre , But the 500E is still a brilliant car . It's sold in tiny numbers on Mercedes-Benz , bothered with the right hand drive version , but it's still a very important part of the corporate history , and it's no circularity here because the car was inspired , at least in part , by A M G's efforts to tune the W 1 to 4 on when ? Years later , Mercedes-Benz M3 in houses its own tuning wing . It was set to work , creating similarly brawny versions of modern cars . Cars like to see a less nearly two decades separates these two cars similarities between them . All the proof you need the recipe was a successful one .Uh huh ."
70,91,ML,"This is the new Mercedes ML . Think of it as a 45 grand kind of Range Rover sport Rydell . Now the thing about these Big Four by fours is that they usually powered by Lumpy V six or V8 Turbo diesel engines . Not this one .Yes , the ML weighs 2.2 tons , but in the 2 50 Bluetec form , you see it here .It's powered only by a 2.1 liter diesel , making just 201 horseman . The key question is , Will that be enough ?Well , engine aside first impressions of the M . L R . That it has a gratifyingly well finished cabin . Perhaps it's a little un interesting compared to the flamboyance of a Range Rovers interior design , but it does feel beautifully put together .It's comfortable to like most Mercedes-Benz gets lovely big chairs . There's ample room in here that it rides impeccably , too .This is a heavy car and it West's and to be sized wheels on a suspension set up primarily for comfort .So come looking for the dynamism of saying BMW X5 Porsche Cayenne . You'll not find it here , but what you will find is one of the most comfortable SUVs on the market .And so to the burning question . Is it quick enough ? And the answer is just about . No , The ML is not a fast car . Mercedes claims naught to 60 takes nine seconds , but seldom does that force in the diesel fuel . It just goes about its business in muted , unhurried fashion . Granted , if you're looking for a tow car , this variant is unlikely to be man enough for the job that on its own really , it's fine , really , absolutely fine .The more time you spend in the ML more you adjust for its face before you get into It isn't trying to be some kind of dynamic benchmark .Isn't sporting season at the way that some four by fours trying to be the NFL is a relaxed , refined four by four lengths off , comfortable in its own skin ? For that reason , it's very , very easy to warm to it . Also , for that reason , the auto car verdict is four stars"
71,92,SLC,"This is the Mercedes SL see , and it's the perfect car for British summers because you can joke with the roof down on the rare occasions that is sonny like today , when it's raining , you can put the roof up on you effectively turn the car into a coupe A rather than a normal ragtop convertible . There you go . Look clever folding metal roof . All very nice .Now this car starts from �32,000 which seems like quite a lot of money , considering it's quite old . Now , if you click up there , you get a co dot co dot uk and you can see some incredible deals on this car .Let's check out the inside now . One of the reasons I want to put three foot was to show you how much space there is in here when you're going about in to pay style . So look at this . The seat . Just go back quite a long way . So even if you're very tall , you should be fine . Andi , there is lots of adjustment in the steering world as well . You got decent head room . If you're large , you're still going to be fine in this car , whereas you probably find it in the squeezing . Something such as the cheaper master in X5 tells the quality .Well , it's not too bad . This is one of Mercedes older cars , like I said , but the materials are still pretty nice , and it all feels solid . There are few things that aren't so nice , though , and that's like the dolls have these just feel cheap and nasty . Also the layer to this console here with all the buttons and stuff , it's just looking a little bit old fashioned now .Nice . Bring some to the trim level , so there's only one AMG line , and in some ways it's well equipped and in other ways . It's not so well equipped . For instance , you don't get satellite navigation as standard on any car . It's an option on this particular model , so if you're in command the top of the range system , it's �2000 .You get a cheaper Becker version , but that's not particularly nice to use . Actually , this command online system isn't all that great to use . Either can get a little bit confusing . Now you took that Save yourself .Watch wanted a video review of the entertainment system off this car doing of options This particular Com site and now has �16,000 worth of options on it , such as these lovely nappa leather seats .As standard , you get fake that you get Mercedes-Benz on .It's actually all right terms . It could be spaces . We don't expect much criticized you on . There isn't much . Got some cup holders here , got some stories into their , which actually , all right , the glove box is a decent size and there are some extendable door pockets there which will take a bottle . Just don't leave it open . Otherwise it's gonna dripping on the floor on listen more storage there as well .Speaking of stories , let's move on to the boot and see what that's like . So the capacity is actually pretty good for a sporty car such as this . If you have a look inside , you'll see there's plenty of space there because this one hasn't got to spare . Well , there is a more storage into there if you need it now , I've got to fit this pack . It is regretting doing that now that it's all right . So , yeah , the boot is pretty large . However , you have to be careful what you take if you wanna put the roof down at any point , because when you put the roof down , you have to make sure that everything fits under this cover because the roof mechanism goes on top of that there . Now I'm going to show you that boy lowering the reef .It's all quite elegant , really , Isn't it ?Just have anything goes wrong with it because that could be expensive to fix .Right ? There we go . So now I'm gonna show you . You see the roofs on top of it . They're probably wondering , How the heck do I get this out of there ? I'm not gonna go through procedure . Put the roof back up , but that's kind of what we need today . Anyway , If you want more detail about this car's practicality , click it there to watch my detail practicality , video . You'll see how much stuff you can fit into this car's boot . That's pretty much it . Not much else to show right then .That's the practical stuff dealt with . Now it's time to hit the road . SLC is quite easy car to drive in town . So while you may sit alone with a big long bond , it's quite easy to tell where the corners of the car . So that makes it Easter maneuver in traffic . If you click it there , you can actually see it yourself by joining May for a point of view . Test drive video . What's not so good about it is that the suspension can feel little bit crashing over bums . You really do feel them sending jumps from the cabin and fidgets around over a rough surface is another thing to watch out for is that on the low powered versions , you can get them with a manual gearbox . You wanna avoid that you want to pay extra for the automatic . It just makes his car easy to drive on . The manual isn't actually a lot of noise .This SLC has a classic sports car set up , so you got an engine at the front and sends power to the rear wheels . They just have to concentrate on driving on the front whales . They just have to concentrate on steering .Thing is , though , it doesn't really feel as much fun to drive as a front wheel drive . Audi T T . It may be a sports car , but it's not the sportiest of sports cars . However , this particular car driving here has the dynamic handling package on that doesn't prove things , so it gives you adjustable suspension . It also gives you sharper steering , and it does feel better to drive with that package for you to it .So I suggest you pay the extra for it . �2000 .Now all cars come with driving . Select where you can move from comfort into sport . When you ever been to sports . Plus did hear that exhaust changes and it gets more raucous .And if you're the dynamic handling package , it stiffens the suspension . So makes a car just a bit flatter in the corners .Now , one thing that really annoys me about this car is that if you wanna put the roof up or down , you actually have to come to a complete stop to initiate the roof mechanism and then you can do it .Once it started it going , you can then start moving a little bit , but not over 25 miles an hour . There was a freak out Stop . Yeah , added Z8 . You can drive along and initiate the roof , which could be very annoying if on the motorway .Speaking of big on the motorway when you put the reef up . This is actually really quiet and relaxing .That's the benefit of having a metal roof rather than a fabric soft top , and it just feels like you're in a coop A8 In terms of the engines .Well , you could get four different petrol engines on one diesel . This particular car is the 300D , so it's got to be two turbo charged petrol engine with 100 45 horsepower , and it will go north sixth day in just 5.6 seconds . And it feels really quick , and it works nicely with his paddle shift nine speed automatic gearbox .Actually , there's more annoying things about this car is five .Whenever you put the roof up or down the coal automatically with the windows back up , if you want it to . Anything is if it gets to put up the rear most windows , so you have to then move to another button to do that yourself . But often you forget what that noise is .This carbon fibre trim looks a little bit tacky , which is even worse , considering it's a �1500 option .It really bothers me that the entertainment screen doesn't line up centrally to the center console . Give me some really bad thing .Shway vibes This advisors a tiny they don't really do a very good job on the poor . Passenger gets a look at this warning sign here , so they're going to spend the whole journey slightly unnerved .

72,93,AMG GT 63 S,"so welcome to Texas , y'all . This is the place that I deal with rope that has some steaks bigger than heads . Hat's bigger than umbrellas boasts bigger than credulity on DDE , where anorexia is probably a disease . Sounds about right . Local certainly seemed to like to go large with stuff , and now they can go large with their favorite Mercedes AMG sports car . This is the Mercedes AMG GT foretell so like and subscribe yeol .So AMG has taken their four litre twin turbo V8 and fiddled it up to no less than 630 horsepower . 664 telephone talk . So that's 10% more power and 30% more talk than even the top of the range GT-R two seater , which , to be fair , the car probably needs because it weighs wait for it half a ton more than the GT-R . So apparently , anti friction turbo bearings have been used to get a performance out of this car , which sounds like a fairly major scientific discovery . I mean , if I am really has invented anti friction overlooking that junior engineer who suggest that dipping the whole car in it may not have been the best idea . Or maybe they listen to it because this thing will do 62 miles an hour from rest in 3.2 seconds , two tons of it on 196 miles an hour , flat out like the regular GT-R . It's got four wheel steering . Unlike the regular duty , it's got four wheel drive for Matic plus . But we needn't worry , because on the 63 s , there is a real drive only drift mode for the use off hooligans idiots on dhe protesters .So you have worked out by now . Although this thing is called a GT , that's not really what it's underneath . Rather than using the space frame a platform of the two seater , which would have probably resulted in less than a practical A4 door and more of a waste of door handles , Mercedes is obviously adopted . The M R8 platform , which is underneath the regular C . L .S on lots of other big Mercedes saloon cars on their names , have gone to town in the usual way by reinforcing the body and white on doing the usual magic on the axles on the suspension on the brakes and the steering , etcetera , etcetera so This car has its own body and white . That's reinforced , not just braced .There's actually metal in this body and white that isn't in any of the regular Mercedes-Benz Carline .And they claim , because the front end is much stiffer on the car as a whole is what more rigid that you get more feedback through the steering , et cetera , et cetera . So how is it on the road ? Is it more Ciel S4 GT-R ? Well , it's a good question . I mean American highways for being the best place to find out how dynamically precise or involved in college this is as a GT . It's certainly a lot easier to use and comfort her than the two seater . Easy get in and out off the seats already come free Ride's already civil and comfortable .Let's go back to talk and just sounds really good . I mean , if they set out to create more of a GT car that you could use every day , get out of a 22 GT-R . Think Yeah , this is the car . This is the AMG . I want a bit more like the saloon I used to have , but maybe a little special .Yeah , I think it does the job , whether it's gonna feel what the proper sports car on the track later on , I don't know . We'll find out .I have my doubts way our circle , the Americas . Time to find out what this thing's made up . Weighs two tons . But it's literally got every technology that GT-R forts cars got on DME or to make it handles like something pretty special .Format A4 . We'll drive it up , their suspension . Active diff four wheel steering , every tool in the box . Basically now , AMG says , The thing that makes it really clever is traffic control system , so you can program it to be exactly as pointy . Andrea will dry feeling or stable and four wheel drive feeling as you fancy . And it's that configurable ity , they say that makes it really special . First impressions are pretty good , and I mean , certainly hides its must pretty cleverly doesn't feel out Titans when it's breaking When it's changing direction , masses really need neatly and tightly controlled on that fancy attraction . These guys are on the kind of regular highlight sport for sires . It is hm , obligated for mission in pilot Sport cups , but they haven't got any now There's no doubt in my mind those toys would take this car even further down that road towards proper sporting driver appeal . We'll put a pin in that .For now , that's pretty good .And it stops well . They're properly big stops on the circuit , right ? So let's say you've been driving this around for a few sets . A lapse as I have in four wheel drive mood with your aides left on . Andi kind of got to grips with what it can do . Performance level , fraction level , grip , level , balance in the car . I mean , it might take you , you know , 10 laps to get there . It might take you 10 track days to get there , but you'll get there as you would in any drop this car . So what do you do ? You stick it in drift mode , don't you ? Because no one knew . And it's not the easiest thing is this process to undergo ? But I've done it even though AMG probably would rather I hadn't because I want everything . This car is a bluff skins . Mrs Wembley does skins . I'm in a very sort of simple , honest way . This is a great handling car because it goes well goes really hard . Stops pretty well , but a bit of understeer in it because it's a big , heavy car . But even informal drive mode gives you lots of options to drive around it and neutralize it . But that's the sort of thing it's greater . Proper AMG . Turn it all off duty piece , kids . I know , I know M5 do this as well . And I dare say Porsche Panamera , it's probably won't probably will if I don't already . But it just feels like a MG thing , doesn't it ? Look , it wouldn't be a proper AMG if it didn't do it , So yeah , it does . It does it right just a bit . And then it gets way missing back on the brakes . No bother . I like I like a lot . You know what started off just with a bit of a downer about this car ? Because it felt a bit . It felt a bit naughty and a bit dishonest to use a sports cars identity , you know , celebrate sort of what amounts to a big super saloon , really kind of figure . It could never be good enough to drive to live up to that , and it's not a sports car , but for a two ton four seater . It's pretty great , You know , this thing does all the basics . Well , it's got great steering field . It's really progressive . It's easy to drill it quickly on . It's a great GT-R because that's what it's about . Really . Order this stuff on a racetrack today ? Pretty fun . But it's kind of neither here nor there because of GT-R .This doesn't do is you take the whole family out for the weekend or take you to work all that easily on this wood on . Yeah , To be honest , I do wish they just called it forward or , you know , drop . GT-R would feel a bit more honest what they were doing here . Give this thing to decisive give A3 ."
73,94,AMG C 63,"This is the Mercedes AMG C 63 it is , Well , you know what it is . It's faster version of C Class has been given the AMG treatment , which is of use A3 your Alexis , our CFO , I suppose , if you like .So it costs about �60,000 . This one is the S , which is the faster of two versions , which means it costs �67,000 UK .And it is quite powerful , actually . Mercedes-Benz most powerful in its class as standard , it's got 470 horsepower . This s version has got 500E M3 , which is a lot because it M3 has got 4 20 The Nexus A4 70 V8 Alexis ways the other side of 1800 kilos on this weighs about the same 16 55 . So should be remarkably false . I knew that they were . The big news , obviously , is the fact that no longer has the large 6.2 liter naturally aspirated V8 downsized smaller foley to V8 with two turbos that nestle actually in between the cylinder banks . I don't sit at the size of the of the V . They say in the top of the V8 , which makes it very compact .So what else is different about it ? Well , it's got a longer knows with big events for calling .It's got 19 inch alloy is standing on this one .This one's on ceramic brakes . Actually rich are on expensive option . As you would imagine , inside , this is fairly sort of C class stuff . Really . You got the shiny black piano stuff with squared off serum were , unfortunately , and some AMG highlights , but it's it's fairly standard . See , classy stuff . What ?I have got one here , obviously , because you always do is selectable drive modes , individual comfort , sport , sport plus and race . On this s version individual means you couldn't tweak some of the damper settings and things and save them to your own taste .But let's start in comfort and see what we've seen . What we got a guy for a drunk .So in comfort , what's it like ? Well , the ride is a bit firmer than a standard C class , as you would as you would think , but it's not uncomfortable .It's very well controlled on these seats , actually , although supportive , very comfortable , too .So no dramas there Gearbox ese , Responsive enough , responsive enough , just kicked out of shape quicker . But then where I comfort So that's That's all right . Steris got a good way to actually sort of middling wait . Speed White builds up just as you get a bit of love corner Z4 through the tithe . Go through into sport gives me a bit more weight with steering . You just get a little bit of extra heard from the gear shift , which is actually and quite handy . So moving through again to sport plus now the exhausted skated You can probably tell .Lucky . That is a good noise , isn't it ? He's a good two turbos , but you wouldn't know you don't hear them throttle response , certainly on their certainly on the road from the Reds is good .I change something for it because I didn't think it was going to . I think it might just run all the way to the red line if you let it in sport . Plus , actually , probably if you're in sport , plus , you might as well stick it in anyone .Do the ship's yourself here You won't this He's a nice car , gives more back hourly than an M four M3 does because it's got more cylinders , It's louder .I reckon I'll say yes .Yeah , this is the sort of thing you and I think this is a sore thing that you want from a modern muscle sports car . It's engages and it talks to stereos . Waited up really , really nicely now . Body control is tight and its goal that stuff that you could drive it spiritedly on the road up to the point way or he'll you're safe . You're having fun . You don't have to go absolutely released again . It gets of enjoyment back from it . I think it's quite important on a road come , well , the road . I think this is nicely focused nicely . Damn it . Good . You like it rather a lot less . It's sucking . Everybody will use XC60 A3 on track certainly , but you got to get the best out of it . Will go to the track . We'll do a few corners . We'll see what it's like out there way .We're now at the bottom l circuit . It's really good circuit actually , really good circuit .I've got everything as you would think turned up to 11 1 exception on the moment on this sport handling mode and see what kind off fact response we get . Revs nights and clearly 3 to 7 runs into a soft limiter .Just , yeah , just allows a little bit of slip home , but it really slows itself . Well . Just feel that , yes , he just started to get involved . Touch . Just please . A little bit of it . It was a little bit of slippage before it cuts in , but fundamentally , it feels really pleasingly balanced .You know , it's got that benign front engine , rear drive , rear drive balance to it with quite a long wheel base .A little bit of initial understand course there is always is .Well , it probably try it in a minute . Where we go for that all off here , See ? Probably quit by breaking into the corner of it is really nice . Actually , you can , right ? Let's go for some here . See action , right ? That's off . Let's see now . She's gonna do thing . There's got something .What I'm worried about the turbocharged engine is that you lose that sort of throttle adjustability .So when it starts sliding , it's sometimes hard to meet you out because you lift off with her basket spinning . You come back on the first , take a while to spool up , and I can make for a car that is not quite as adjustable is even think .Well , I like this car more more , and it just has that nice sort of German field . It kind of feels like it would do it forever . A3 this is a belting . This is an absolute belter hassle .Fangio sees something else XC60 A3 You promise ? You invest in a sketch of tires , take it to a circuit and do this because I promise you ."
74,95,GLA 45,"Now I know some people quite like a higher driving position than normal .I've spent a bit of time with J . L . A . 45 Gina .I'm kind of struggling to get it , to be honest , because all this car seemed to offer instead of the really just excellent ordinary A4 A5 , which I ran for a few months and just loved to pieces because it's just the maddest or has there is a LL this thing offers over and above the regular A4 Z4 energy is 40 millimeters of extra driving position height on a slightly bigger boot .And when I say slightly , I really do you mean about that much I'm not see on yet .It doesn't drive anywhere near it Krispy handle as well , because it weighs more on the center of gravity's higher .It doesn't go as well because it's heavy .It's force A4 grand , and I'm afraid through these eyes it doesn't look a patch on the regular hatchback , either .Having said all of that , if you drive this thing in isolation , if you completely ignore the fact of the 8 45 Angie exists in the first place , you would get into this on .Think a little part of the universe had begun to end because , you know , it's still got 355 BHP two litre turbo engine under that rather high and very ugly bonnet , which means when you put your foot down , it's still properly fast .It has the same A7 speed dual clutch gearbox in it , which , to be honest , is one of the 8 45 weak points , and it's no better in this car . It's OK . It works pretty well , but it doesn't have to snap that Provigil clutch gearbox should have . And it handles , you know ? I mean , have a look at this . I'm driving this thing quite hard on it just leans . It hangs over . Yes , there is a bit of understeer . Yes , you need to give the brakes that these broad to get it to slow down .But I mean , okay , 115 miles on a bank to call here and it just feels stuck .There's a little bit of push that's just engineered in to make it feel safe . Basically , they sing really handles and it really goes on .It sounds right to test cars . Got the sports exhaust in it . So you get R8 , which I think is great , but quite how relevant that is in a sort of mini SUV , I really don't know .It is a proper hot part of a cover , nearly 45 mg , and I just can't really get my head around who would actually buy one on y V8 by one instead of in a 45 ?Baffled . So let's see if I could make any more sense of it by going off road . Is that Is that why you buy one of these things ? Just say Go through a muddy field , innit ? Let's , uh , let's go try this , you deceiving ?That's no bad a tool , actually . I mean , this is very far from the most challenging off road course in the universe . However , I have to say this is probably one another thing that the G l a . Another talent , another capability . That jail has that the A 45 doesn't reckon you get enable G5 .Well , it's just got that he's got 20 inch wheels , normal road tyres but 20 inch wheels And that that little bit more ground clearance on the driving position .I guess you do just feel as if you could go through quite rough terrain like this , and it's actually really not that much of a problem at all .I don't I genuinely don't think you'd get in a 45 around this course without getting a terrible puncture . A huge hole in the radiator . Well , just stop .It's actually no bad off road . This thing . No . I mean , you're not gonna suddenly turn up some off roading school wearing your camouflage trousers , smoking Rolley's and saying Right , let's go out the side of Everest or anything like that . But it it will do off roading , and I'm quite impressed with that .I just noticed something else that's got instead of in a 40 in place , even A5 . That's the sun roof .But okay , what we're talking about is a bit of off road capability , a sunroof , a slightly higher driving position on a 1,000,000 metric Lee bigger boot , and that's it .Otherwise , give me an A 45 energy any day off any week"
75,96,C Class,"the word coup pay is French for cut , and that's exactly what Mercedes is done to its C class to produce the rather lovely C Class coupe . A . Now the saloon is already pretty blooming lovely , but this one this turns out the one factor all the way to 11 .So it's two grand more than the equivalency in the key players .And then there's the cost in terms of practicality , because it's reduced over the saloon , so the big capacity is about 80 litres less . And in case you're wondering , that's about the same volume as my body .And here , the boot itself , the opening in the overall shape size isn't quite as good as on the equivalent BMW four . Serious . But you did get some nice features , such as You got a shopping bag hawkers netted there in the cover . You get full down rear seats to split three ways . You could operate them from the boot while the but it's not a smaller than the saloons .Obviously , another compromise in terms of practicality is getting into the back , so these doors do open nice and wide .And when you pull the seat forward , Elektronik Lee wants forward out of your way so you can get into the rear on inside here actually was lovely in here with the individual contoured seats and oh yeah , nice , nice cabin .And then you try and sit back and realize it's not tonight in the back door for passengers . There is absolutely no headroom at all near rooms , all right , but there's no way I could travel anywhere in this . I mean , this is really only for kids back . It's really , really cramped in the sea . Bus dead up right as well . And if you want to see just how easy Easter Fairchild sit in this car , click up there on the car to watch her index practicality video , where you can also see what it's like with two adults in the back .And just how much stuff you can squeeze into this car's boot .Really , these kind of cars aboard by people just travel with two in them on occasion needs and we're seats on in the front . Thanks . Carl is wonderful . I mean , just pop in to wait for the state to slide back .That's what this one at the same time so you can see what's going on what a lovely interior this is now .These seats , especially made for the coup painless sit lower in the cost of the whole thing , just seems more sporting .This particular car is the AMG line version . It has some upgrades . It's got real leather seats rather than artificial leather on its extended the artificial leather up on the dash .And to do those upgrades , you're talking a grand , but they're well worth because it makes it just feel so preview in here .This one has the premium plus package , which includes the permitted A stereo , this panoramic glass sunroof .You also get the upgraded command online system , which is better than the standard Gorman SecNav with small screen that you get on the normal kites .Definitely worth the upgrade , but it is expensive . It's three grand . That's a lot of money .And , to be honest , this entertainment system yeah , the whole user interface in the menus . There's no it's good to use as Bender , please . I drive system now . If you click up there on the top right hand corner , the screen on the car that should be appearing . Now you can watch an in depth video review of the entertainment system and have another good look around this car's cabin on before I finish up , I should just point out that could be spaces for a coupe .They are actually pretty good , so there's lots of storage into here . There's a big glove box . There's cup holders . They're on the door big . Big enough to hold one the whole liter bottle . So yeah , pretty and practical .But for cars like this , driving dynamics also . So how does the Mercedes C class keep a measurer ? Let's get this straight from the outset . If you want the sharpest handling Cooper this class , it's still the BMW four .It's also got slightly better visibility as well , because the real went on this car . It's very steep and quite sure that good to be at the back and , well , you can see for yourself like licking it there to watch our 360 degree video off this kind .But in every other way , I actually prefer the way this Mercedes e que pay feels to drive .So first of all , it's really white Sands . Proving is excellent . Also , it's really comfortable .So if you buy this car and you get the sport version . The suspension has a perfect blend of comfort on handling a N G line . Models have to have stiffer suspension , and the ride is a bit firmer .So if you get one of those cars , spend �900 extra for the optional air suspension because it's lovely .So in comfort mode , this car just glides on the road . It's so relaxing , and then you can press a button putting into dynamic mode . It sharpens everything up . And then you realize that , Yeah , this car , it's easily fun enough for most people .Most people buy this car will go for a diesel , and it's actually the right choice because the petrol engines are really that good . Well , unless you're going to buy one of the high performance AMG version . But this is the 2.1 liter diesel . It's the 2 20 It's a little bit noise when you accelerate , but you can't fault the economy's don't get it 57 miles per gallon . You could get similar economy from the C T 50 day , which could get from north 62 miles an hour in seven seconds or thereabouts .And it's definitely worth the upgrade because it's more sporting counter suits this sporty car Better also , make sure you get the automatic gearbox with a diesel is a new nine speed , and it's lovely , super sleek and response perfectly when you put your foot down . Also , you don't want a manual anyway because , well , Mercedes-Benz yours will make you pull this face .There are some other things about the secrets . Keep a , which will make you pull a funny face .Is five of them being released at the back of the car ? You can only actually open it by a button in the car or by the remote key FOBs or by using the power of your mind .This windscreen signature is a little bit tacky . Otherwise , cool car .This car has been the longest doors of any Mercedes-Benz , a bit tricky to get out in tight parking spaces .This safety 20 locates deep , looks a little bit rubbish on such a beautiful car .It's in Stevie that Mercedes .Another shortcut buttons for the entertainment system there with control of , but they instead still , this Mercedes as some really nice features which help make up for all this , you can summon the emergency service's or get breakdown assistance .Just by pressing one of these buttons , you get small phone app , which will help you locate the card .You can't quite remember where you left it .

76,97,SLS,"there is a big difference between road testing a car and actually living with it day to day now . I think it's one of the greatest privileges that we have in this job , that we can use these cars on a daily basis and actually find out what they like to own on behind . May I think you'll agree The Mercedes SL s is one of the finest looking ownership propositions anywhere . Lester later on , athlete . But we've lived with it for five months and it goes back soon . So this is what it's like to live with less theme .With a car like the S L s . It's really quite hard to just look past the sort of gut wrenching desirability that's so much a part of it . But we've covered 12,000 miles in the S a less over the last few months , and actually that's given us a chance to really lift it . Straight weakness is that it offers as an ownership proposition .Thief basically owned the car , and you've done the most miles and over the last few months . So what do you think of it as an ownership proposition ? I think it's great . It's continually grown on us all , I think , but particularly me . We've done 10,000 miles in a little under six months , which is a big mileage for car like this and the things that that a good , really good aren't made a massive engine performance .Lovely engine , confident . And of course , I love the the way you are in the car . It's better than a mid engine car for me .You sit with your backside right near the rear , wheels big , long nose when it doesn't nice tearing anyway , when it does anything , you really feel it .And the things I don't like , I guess , are the particularly the wit makes it hard to use in town . You got to be very careful of the wheels to �5000 a corner , but really apart from that , it's great .There's a perhaps the gearbox could do with being a little bit Maur sensitive in , you know , in the track modes . But honestly , brilliant . Yeah , it's pretty hard to fault with it , I think so , says one of the mighty strong points of this car is the 6.2 liter V8 , which is just amazing for a naturally aspirated V eight engine . There's no inertia , and it robes always A7 1000 which sounds a bit like this most extraordinary sounding cars from the inside as well as the outside . And that's one of the great things . And you know what ? Despite using it in town on the most way , all over the place , doing a lot of miles in it . We've never , ever got bored of that sound . It's never got wearing . It's never got irritating .It's just one of the other very clear benefits of this car . Other looks now , the going doors . When we initially got it , I was sort of worried that they might prove a bit impractical . But weirdly , there are actually more practical than normal doors . They take up less space to open in a small , tight car parking space , which he will be in most of the time because this car is 2.1 meters wide .Even taking that into account , Onda Steve said , the fact that you might want the gay box to be just a little bit sharper .It's just the most astonishing car on DDE . What we had issues with it when we initially got hold of it and road tested this car slightly to nova , steering slightly too sharp throttle . Step off living with it . You just give it everything .Living with this car has completely changed its appeal on . Honestly , the familiarity has brought nothing but respect . It proved to be completely intoxicating . GT-R .It has such a unique character , all of its own , that blends kind of brutality and elegance together in the way it drives on the way it looks .It's a really vivid and exciting companion for any journey , and we're gonna be completely got ID Teoh ."
77,98,C Class,"created in 1992 to replace the legendary 1 90 C class , has become so his bestselling car ever since , which is why Mercedes-Benz thrown in the proverbial kitchen sink at this latest model .Inside and out , the new C feels like a free upgrade into business class , says Mercedes .It's a touch bigger than before , but crucially , it's also 100 kilograms lighter .Thanks to the extensive use of our dominion , it's also no aerodynamically efficient , which in turn helps it to be more economical , borrow 20% .So despite being the replacement for a car that was already way better than decent , the new C represents a giant leap force , says S8 .Model We test here is the C 2 50 Bluetec , which is a 2.1 litre , four cylinder turbo diesel engine and costs just over �30,000 .This particular example has the A N G line trim option , plus a matic suspension on pretty much every other option that's available , which takes the price to know far south of �40,000 .There is no question that there is a lot of tank in the new C cast , possibly a bit too much down here . You've got this agility switch which allows you to dial up five different Dr programs from ICO to comfort to sport to sport . Plus to then individual where you can individually tune steering , suspension , engine , kid box . We could probably change the weather . If you want to buy this time little button down here .They could be a bit too complex for , you know , this'd just the C carts that we're talking about .We're not talking about kind of super complex Hypercar here on another area in which I think they may have gone way over the top with the complexity of this car . Is this little thing here ?I'm actually gonna have to come to a stop to describe what goes on in this because basically , it's like a little iPhone . Here . You can scroll in , scroll out . You can even when you calling up your your phone directory , you press telephone like that and this thing comes up on you can , then okay . If you want to call your mate Simon , you just scribble S8 . Or if you wanna call , William has come out of the eight . Ugo is over thinking it . I'll tell you what I think of this particular little device , especially as you've got a rotational dial here as well , which does exactly the same thing . Shut up . This is what I think of this particular bit with class .Hey . Oh , yes , E . Once you got past the kind of giving factor of it , I just don't think it's necessary .Loads of things that you notice straight away on the move . It feels lovely in light on its feet . You see , You know , that's because it weighs less than the previous model on the previous model is no slouch . It really does have this lovely delicacy of touch to it . Likeness of steering , steering still accurate It is , You know , you steer it with your fingertips , you don't have to kind of muscle around with his shoulders , and that's lovely . But it just feels agile turkey responsive to your interests in a way that even the previous scene wasn't . And that was a very good car .So the steering in the chassis and the ride and the brakes pretty much everything about see crafts on the move is is really good .Really improved , well worth it , even if it is a bit expensive But one thing I'm not sure is quite good is the motor . It's go , you know , adequate amount of power , a decent amount of talk . But it's still , you know , it's a 2.14 part .This is nearly �40,000 .It's not quick enough and be it does not make a very nice does not make a noise .It's just a sort of an iodine , Dr . You know , I drive the new Porsche Macan Diesel last week on the engine in nothing beautiful . The engine in this car , it's very far from beautiful .Initially , there'll be just three trim never to choose from S E sport on AMG Line , and you'll be able to tell you when you see in which ever way you wish .So if you want it to look and feel sporty inside but appear conservative on the outside , you can go for the AMG lined interior with the more subtle S E exterior , or vice versa .The engine in the 2 50 Bluetec produces 201 BHP and �368 free to talk , giving a 0 to 60 time of 8.1 seconds and a top speed of 155 .The gearbox is a seven speed auto with paddles .The equipment BMW A3 series 3 to 5 D m Sport is a touch quicker , but it's not as economical .Nor is it a well specified inside if their respective option lists are similarly aligned .So the bottom line with the new C Class is that it definitely drives better than before .It definitely feels more expensive inside .It's bigger outside , and it's more spacious inside .It doesn't have the nicest engine at the moment , but you know much nicer engines will make their way into the range eventually .It's a very good car in some areas . It's a brilliant car , but you know what ? I'm not sure it's quite up there with the latest A3 . We'll find out in a couple of weeks time when we do very obvious to , in test very obvious comparison test involving all the rival . With the time being , it's a big thumbs up the new C . I'm not prepared to sit here and speak into the camera and say that it is the best car in its cost because I'm not sure it is"
78,99,C Class,"the Mercedes C class . Now , having one of these on your drive , let your neighbors know that you have made a success out of your life .It's just so stylish , a sleek , so elegant and that three pointed star , well , it's It's a trophy . It's much better than having something like this on inside the car is equally is beautiful fact . Slipping into Miss a DC class is a bit like strapping on an expensive handmade Swiss watch . And this is not some facades and cheap quartz movement underneath , either , because everywhere you feel all the materials , a very high quality Mercedes-Benz screamed on cubby spaces either .It's not bad for this class of car . You little ball in the side door been in terms of equipment , impressive as well .All models get a reversing camera , and he also get man made leather seats , and I know what you're thinking . I made leather . Believe me , I'd rather have that in the coffee room .You get a standard in an Audi A4 where you want to do they step up to the sports model , which is cool because you get extra design trinkets inside the cabin and sat never standard there is a cheapo Garmin sat nav .Now you control it using the swivel will and touch pad on dhe . Well , the system's all right , but it's not as good as you'll find in either BMWs or Audi is . And you can see how full review of the system buckling on the card in the top right hand corner of the screen to see in debt .Entertainment review Overall , then the Mercedes C class is pretty blooming lovely here in the front . As for the back well , the feeling of quality that continues . For instance , if you look down here at the back seats , you have actual folders , like in an airplane , not just some net , as he's doing other cars .Of course , it's a Mercedes , but in terms of space for red passengers . Yeah , some of his rivals do fare better , such as the Audi A4 . I'm sitting up straight on five for 11 and I've barely got enough headroom , so someone over six foot is really going to struggle . Also , the middle seat . Well , the footballs are quite small , but this big home , which takes up a lot of space , so yeah , the middle seat . I think we'll leave that your intern so really ? Overall , there are better cars for taking your colleagues to that insurance seminar . Never click on the top right hand corner of the screen . You can see exactly what happened when we tried to squeeze three people in the back of this car Andan soul , a baby seat .Plus , you can see just how much stuff we managed to cram into the boot . Speaking of which , the outright capacity of the C class is boot is on a pole with its rivals on DDE . It's practical enough . The only issue I have is the fact that this tailgate opening there is just a little bit curved , which does hamper practicality somewhat on the holocron complain too much . One day I can complain about is that if you won't fold down rear seats on the entry level model , you have to pay extra for those But this standard on the high spec versions and when you have them , you can really carry long items in this car because you get a nice , flat low bay and check this out right . If you've got feeble wrists and you Oh dear , I can't quite shut this tailgate or secret is a standard . Get an automated one . So , yeah , thank God for that .The C Class has some other features which are more useful . Is five of them .The satnav knows when you're in a tunnel and turns off the events to prevent fumes entering the cabin , the car can drive and steer itself at speeds of up to 37 miles an hour .After that , I guess you're on your own .The central locking has been specifically engineered to Macon upmarket sounding clunk .The car can spot if he invented a no entry , and we'll tell you off for going the wrong way .The high being mass oncoming traffic to prevent dazzling The C class is in perfect , though .Here's some annoying things about it in UK cars .The driving position is a little bit off set so you can feel it touch twisted behind the wheel .The shortcut buttons for the entertainment system on with the control .Look that there 2.1 , letting things elections pretty noisy . Sounds like it belongs in the band car .At the moment , you can't get the car in the UK with all wheel drive .Why standard entertainment screen is a bit like a cheap knockoff .To be fair , this Mercedes was really need to be four wheel drive as it's very secure on the road .S8 did see class . It really takes the stink of long motorway . Journey is it's covered . His nice inquire . The seats are really comfortable on .It feels planted when you going quickly , especially if you got the optional air suspension , which is unique in this class . Now , if you can't stretch to that set up , you got three choices . So there's the nice and soft comfort suspension in the S C model , which unfortunately just felt a bit too Roli poli in the corners . Then there's the really hard sporty suspension in the AMG line , which is just too firm and fit . It's about all over the place now . The best bet is one of this car . This is the sport model on . It has a happy midpoint , so you get good handling on decent comfort , and it's the one the I recommend you go for visibility .This car is pretty much the same as its rival , so not bad for a salute . Not quite as good as a hatchback , and you can see for yourself by clicking the top right hand corner of the screen on the card to watch our 360 degree video .In terms of engines you can of petrol power , you can have hybrid power . You can have diesel power , which obviously is going to be the most popular . This is the 2 50 CD I , so it's a 2.1 liter diesel engine on Dhe . It's got just over 200 horse by , and that's good for naught to 60 . In not much more than six seconds , it feels really quick . It gives good economy , too , So Mercedes-Benz 65 miles per gallon , the chick computer says 51 mpg , which isn't bad at all .Now , I would recommend you spend extra to get this engine , though most people probably fine with a slightly cheaper to 20 CD away , which has the same engine . But we're just a bit less power .One thing you've gotta spend extra on , though , is the automatic gearbox , because Sadie's manual is a little bit yuck on , really should have to change gears yourself in the Mercedes dig . God , no .What do I think of the Mercedes C class ?Well , that 2.1 liter diesel engine is a bit noisy on rear headroom , a touch tight , but it's a super luxurious car , and it's really relaxing Cruiser .If you click up there , you can see more information and find out the best deal you can get on a C class .

79,100,SLS,"we know that the Mercedes SL s is a thing off deep , deep joy . We've run one for 10,000 miles this year , and we absolutely adore it . We also know that it's a much softer car than similarly priced rivals such as the Ferrari 458 Italia on the McLaren MP for 12 . See , it's more of a GT car , much less focused . So you would think that a soft top car would be the perfect addition to the S L s range .It comes as no surprise that the software pass the last makes a lot of sense . You worry about the lack of rigidity , but actually you don't feel it on the road Mercedes-Benz that the roads the ways Only 40 kilograms more than the coupe , but about 1745 kilograms , which is really quite impressive for a car of this size .It still drives really beautifully . Anything slightly better than the coupe Mercedes have upgraded suspension counter the way , and now there's this new medicine to it , where they might have beens crashing into going .There's still some of the same *** was going on . In particular , the gearbox is slightly less intuitive than you might hope . But really , the SL s roadster is such a complete car . It's really fantastic .Truthfully , 6.2 days V8 engine in this car completely dominates it . And you would forgive it far , far more sense than any of the floors in this car to get that engine . It is one of the best sounding cars in production .And if there is any reason you would spend a K on the roadster over the coop , it would be for the noise .Just so is there anything that the SS roadster doesn't do as well as the going well , ultimately no buffers of nutritious rear visibility . The roads is actually the slightly better car with a car that sounds this good . Who doesn't want to be able to take the roof down ? But for us , the SL s is defined by its going . It is a spiritual predecessor to the original going on .So the fact that the roadster has these normal doors , it's something that we find a bit hard to forgive .So there's no denying that actually , the roast is the slightly better car , right ? A bit better sounds utterly amazing , and it totally would make sense why somebody would choose it . But for us , our money would still go on the going"
80,101,SL,"It's always properly exciting when a new Mercedes SL arrives , because it doesn't tend to happen very often . The S L has been around now since the sublime 300SL of 1952 and since then it has gone through just six Evolution's with the most recent being this all new model on when Mercedes-Benz it . It's a totally new platform , and this is also the first Mercedes-Benz all aluminium body show , which weighs 110 kilograms less than it would work . Built with steel , even the trademark folding hardtop is made of magnesium to save weight . Then , of course , there are the new blue direct engines , which claimed to improve efficiency by up to 30% . There is even a world premiere of a new technology , rather fabulously named Magic Vision Control . To you and me , that translates as windscreen wipers , which get out 160 jets of water and clear the windscreen very nicely without at any point , obscuring your view down the road .So the new SL is lighter , faster , more efficient , has much better wipers on . Of course , Mercedes-Benz is a much 40 drive from the previous .We are in the SL 500E , which means we get a 4.7 liter V8 twin turbo charged engine , which puts out 430 brake horsepower , �516 1st of talk and yet rule that it will return Mercedes-Benz on a combined cycle 31 miles to the gallon and 212 grams per kilometer now , but is quite exceptional for a car that will do naught to 60 in 4.6 seconds .There is no denying that the SL still feels more like a GT car in a sports car . It's definitely most at home graze around on the boulevard , looking good . But having said that , we find ourselves on a mountain road and it is no bad . It'll it's quite pointy .The engine is spectacular , very linear is quite accessible . Despite the amount of power it produces . Generally , it actually responds very well . The rise in particular is really exceptional .We've got standard dampers on our car , which are semi adjustable . You can get fully active jobs if you want to pay for the option . Judging by how good this is , I really don't think it's necessary . Did you lots of confidence in the car there is a little bit of flex , but nothing that you wouldn't accept for a car like this . S8 500E gets a seven speed automatic gearbox . It's got three modes . Manual sport on economy in economy . It's pretty good . Actually , it blows the ship . It's really smooth . You wouldn't ever really ask it from or in sports . It could be a little bit lazy , but manuals best for vigorous driving and in that mode is really good . Actually , my only real problem is with the steering , which is an electromechanical set up , speed sensitive , and there's just very little field of it . Most of the time . It's all right , actually , if you really pushed the car , but otherwise , I think it needs to be a bit better , really . Whether you consider this a GT-R sports car .Still , even taking all that into account , the SL 500E is an extraordinarily complete machine . It's a good move on from his predecessor , and it's something that Mercedes is quite rightly proud off .500E is expected to cost around about �82,000 when it goes on sale in the U . K . Of course , ultimately , it is a car that is all about style .We'll let you make your own mind up about the looks of the SL . I think it's a little bit ungainly and bland next to other cars that you can get in that price range .However , those who were a fan of the Aesir won't be disappointed with this car . It really is a great all round sports road stuff . Some might want it to be a little more focused . Ultimately , it's a fabulous GT-R , and it's definitely one of the best in class ."
81,103,AMG A 35,"This is the new Mercedes and G , A 35 . Based on the brand new A Class , it's the new entry point to a MG . It's not a direct replacement for the old A 45 .There'll be a new A 45 along soon , with more than 400 BHP , the A 35 2 litre turbo engine develops 302 BHP �295 feet of torque in the UK it'll cost from �35,580 now , apart from all the obvious stuff that you'd expect of a hot hatch this time around , AMG has gone too much further lengthen it went to with the old A 45 a .M g . For instance . There's a sheer panel underneath the engine bay , which acts as body strengthening , bracing for the body to make it firmer so that it flexes less .That means the suspension has a much more stable platform from which to do its job . It also means you get sharper , more consistent steering response . There's another big change in the four wheel drive system . Like the old A 45 it still has that howled X Type four wheel drive system , so it's front wheel drive most of the time , and then when it needs to send power rare words , it concerned up to 50% of the drive to the rear axle . That means it's not the type . Before I'll drive system that you would've found it , say the Ford Focus RS . Still very much a front biased Boyle drive system .However , this time the rear axle is actuated by an electromechanical differential rather than electro hydraulic . Basically , that means it's a much faster responding sister , much more responsive .It's also predictive . So , whereas in the old A 45 it would only shunt drive real words when the front axle slipped . Now it can predict that moment of slip and send Dr Rhee words before the front axle loses traction . These are quite important changes because certainly the way the former drive system worked in the old A 45 was one of the frustrations we have with that car . The other one was that the chassis , the suspension was so rigid , so it felt crash she over a bumpy road , and on UK roads , that meant that it was compromised now that a 45 was spectacularly fast 370Z six horsepower bundles of grip , loss of body control . But strangely , it just wasn't that engaging to drive something like a rent a sport . McGann of the Day or Focus rs , or even a go far would have been a much more enjoyable , rewarding driving experience . Not as fast but more enjoyable . So what we want from this ?A 35 . Clearly , it's not gonna be as fast as that a 45 .But we wanted to be a more engaging in rewarding Hodge .Now Mercedes AMG tell us that the collar they benchmarked for this new model wants the old A 45 which is maybe concerning because they think that car was the best , very high performance Super hatch going now .I think most of us would probably disagree with that . So that's something we have to look out for when we're driving this car today is it only is good . Only his entertaining drivers that a 45 or have they managed to tease out a bit of character , bit of personality and a bit of fun ? There's maybe is good drivers . The Focus RS or VW Golf R8 .. It is important to note that this is the most affordable AMG yet in the UK . Prices will start at 35 a half �1000 which is a little bit more expensive than gold . Far may be in line with an Audi X3 , but a lot cheaper than the old A 45 and cheaper as well , then Audi RS4 three These May , or can roads are normally smooth ?We would killed toe Have rights . Dismay .There's this in the UK compared to these roads are a disaster , however , on the few bomb pierce slightly rougher sections that we have found . I think the right quality in this guy's a big over that old a 45 . Now adaptive dampers are optional .They cost about �700 .They are fitted to this car , and if I switch into comfort mode , the ride is settled . The ride is composed . It's fluid . Maybe not . Thio . VW Golf are levels , but certainly much better than that old a 45 . So we've got bundles of driving modes . The new one is called slippery , which clearly we're not going to be using today . That's for very heavy rain and snow and ice and all the rest of it . You've got individual mode where you can configure the car the way you like it . Comfort , and they've got sport sport Plus Now when the road gets twisty like this one is now I'm just using sport . Plus , partly because with this button here on this theory , even within sport , plus , I can cycle through different damper settings and go back into comfort . Mode of the road is bumpy into sport mode . If it's sort of medium and then when it's really smooth , you can use the full sport plus , and that's where you get the sharpest handling . The sharpest response is the best body control , and in that mode , I have to say the car feels fantastic . Ready , good control , precision , agility on bundles and bundles of grip . At times , the roads have been a little bit slippery this morning , but on these pearly p zero ties there so much bite . You can carry so much speed through corners in this car .Clearly , we don't have the performance of the old a 45 but with 300 to brake horsepower , �295 of talk yeah , it's plenty brisk enough is not the most character for the most thrilling engine going . But as far as these very modern to Leeds , a force in the turbo units go . I think it's very good . Good throat response . Good energy at the top end that keeps pulling nice and hard on . Then it's sport plus mode . Exhausted . What else have we got ?We've got seven speed twin clutch gearbox , rapid fire dishes ready . Quick works nicely in auto mode as well . When you're just mooching around , we've got a massive set of brakes on the front axle , which looks really good . They look like they're gonna be super durable , and it took a really quick charge down a mountain road to start to get them to overheat on the pedal to go a little bit long . Steering is very good for e past . It's never gonna be dripping with field , but it's Crispin . It's sharp and has a predictable rate of response , though it's intuitive and he's got a good weight as well .Good amount of resistance , great cabin , good seats .You know what ? There's a lot of like about this car . No . One nearest quick in a straight line as the old A 45 but I think the longer twisting road you're not gonna give anything away on . Based on the experience I've had with this car today , I think it's a more rewarding and engaging car than that .A 45 is that the most railing �35,000 each hot hatch going ?I don't think it is really probably something like the McGann Randy Sports .The new trophy is going to be a more intoxicating , more rewarding sort of hot hatch when you're on a mountain road . But this is very good , and I think in everyday use long distance use . It's gonna knock that redneck sport for six .What's amazing is this is only the second hole hatch Mercedes AMG has ever built after that original a 45 . It's quite clearly a better around car than that A4 . I think . In overall terms , it's a very good premium every day . Hot hatch . When you judge it in those terms , I think it's very good indeed ,"
82,104,C Class ,"This is the new Mercedes C Class couple .A residency with the roof down . It's a really beautiful looking car .Little wonder , then , that Mercedes could get away with charging from �35,000 for one .Still , if you click up there to get a car dot co dot uk , you can save an average of �2400 on this car and with the roof up because it's a fabric top other hearts off , it doesn't know me a little bit of a man wearing a to pay . Sorry , you're not gonna be Elton . See that now . It's a bit of a show because it is still a beautiful looking car . And the reason for having the refund for this part of the review . So you get better idea the car's practicality for when you're driving around most of the time , which we will do with the roof . Let's be honest now . Unsurprisingly enough , this cover Les is pretty much identical inside A6 scoop , so the dash design is lovely , sporty on the quality . It's impressive as well . Throughout on some equipment is good as well .So you get are two cola .The seats were exactly to you with me on you get things like climate control , automatic windscreen wipers on headlamps .You also get a seven inch screen up there , which does look a little bit cheap and nasty . So you better off grading to the largest green you get with command online system .And still , the whole system isn't quite as intuitive to use His BMW I drive and kick up there you can watch are full in depth review of the entertainment system .Other than that , you know , this is quite a practical convertible Z8 vehicle of boxes . Plenty of space under there . The door bins can hold a massive bottle of water on .There's even some useful practicality here in the back of the car , not the way this seat moves forward to help you get in .So we always got some could be space down here .And if I said something pulled this chair back and its slide back to my driving position , Well , yeah , OK , so head room's pretty tight back here . My head is on the roof . I slashed . I can get away with it . The seat backs are quite upright , but I could do I could be a few miles in the back of it , no problem at all .And if you need some added practicality to current and big items , you can actually fall down these seats and you get some through loading there on .That brings us on to the boot . So the jet to slide forward . I'll just pop the boot open now for this kind of car . Besides , is actually all right now . You pretty noticed this thing here . You have to have that down when you get to take the reef down . But if you want to carry as much as you can , you can pop it out the way . As long as you got the roof up , you can do that , and then the boot is bigger . It's an extra storage under here , and if you look , we seem to have Ueo . S8 is like to do this . You get these optional baskets for some reason for your job . Really well , if you click it there , you can watch are full in depth practicality video , and you're about to see just how much stuff you can fit in this car's boot .How easy it is to fit a child . See what it's like with two adults in the back seat .So what's Mercedes-Benz Cabral A8 like to drive ?Convertibles are always a bit of a compromise . You chop off the roof , you reduce the structural rigidity of the cars or the manufacture tries to get around that by adding extra bracing . And that adds weight . And still , you often feel the car shake over bombs . Think is there with this Mercedes-Benz couplet . There's hardly any difference between on the coop . A8 Is Justus comfortable ?It seems toe handled pretty much as well , even though it is heavy , really does disguise . It's extra ball very well , because about 100 kilos more , this is just a really nice car to cruise around it .With the roof up on DDE , it's well insulated as well . Hardly any wind or road noise .My only problem really is their reward Visibility . You got massive pillars at the back , and they create huge blind spots and you click up there to join me for my 360 degree passenger video .You can see for yourself so this car is great with a roof up , but it's even better with the roof down on . I can operate the roof at speeds of up to 30 miles an hour . So that's handy if you know the weather suddenly gets good and you wanna take the reef down into Dr Long in traffic , we gotta take the longer till it's all very efficient or very German , actually .And now , yeah , you can really enjoy the experience just wafting around wind in your hair .Or they just have to be in your hair too much , because if I press this button , I can raise a special spoiler just a hay up . And there's an extra air deflector at the back , which just completely cuts out a wind buffeting even for people in the back .I mean , it's a really nice system , slightly cold day like today . I press this button here to blow hot air at events just behind my head Rest , and then it's all nice and toasty .Now this car is actually a 2.1 little diesel on dhe . Your desires and convertibles are great , but it's punchy enough is a C to 20 . You could get an even more powerful sea to 50 days . The only issue I have with it is the fact that when you put your foot down . This engine is quite rough . It's a bit of a shame because you can also get petrol engines in this car and they sound better . Especially you go from one of the high performance AMG models . Can't fault the economy , though . This thing supposed to do 61 more to go on the trip , Computer says . I'm doing 51 . We'll try that .However , I know everything about the Mercedes C class . Cabral A8 is perfect . Here's five annoying things about it .There's no external boot release you can anything using the key or from inside the car base Advisors .They're just little bit cheap and nasty . Continue this cost . Bactrim looks great , but it scratches easy .Well , you take the roof down with people in the back . You need to let them know to move ahead forward . Side otherwise happens family room distance like to the rear parking sensors apart , obscured by the wind deflector .Thankfully , these were all minor Nichols , as there's plenty to like about the C Class Cabral A8 . Here's five call things .When you get into the car , a little seat belt butler passes , you harness a little graphic in front of you shows you where the roof is in its process of operations . So you know exactly what's going on without him to turn around .This car has an electrically operated steering column because in a Mercedes you really shouldn't have to do under this badge is the reversing camera on that helps keep the lines nice and clean . Actually led intelligent lights were just there being automatically became on the conditions on Roe Taste to help guide you around the corner .Now , if you think they get more information and find out the best deal you can get on this car a car wow dot co dot uk .So what's my final verdict on the C class cub relay ? Should you avoid it ? Should you consider it ? Should you short list it , or should I just go right ahead and buy it ? You know what ? If I was after a convertible , I go right ahead and buy it .

It's not real leather , but it feels good enough , and this one's got this wood veneer in it .I mean , Ward can offering cars , but this is absolutely gorgeous .There's also countless cars . Well , to get things like Look , an electric steering column are standard . Electrically operated seats are heated as well as a fully loaded .The only slight problem is the entertainment system , so most cars come with an eight inch screen . This is actually the grated 12 inch system with command online , and you get that with a six cylinder engine , the visa spectral .And you do wanna upgrade to this if you have one of the force under cars , because it just looks great and I can get it with this smart looking digital drivers display .Now , if you click up there , you can see my full in depth video review off this entertainment system . One thing I should point out , though , is that these controls it's touch sensitive controls on the steering wheel do take a little bit of getting used to it . It's an all right system to use . It's not easy you to use as it is good to look at .Unfortunately , but on the whole year , lovely in here on this indecent practicality , with the big door bins and a little bit of room into their will , it fit . No , we haven't learned that now on this one more cup holders here , which are big enough for factor bottles .Now one of the bombs with who pays is that there's not much room in the back of them . The sloping roof line does affect the old head room . I'll just get this out of the white . I'll try to get this other ways . You can see what's going on now . Let this C come back electrically . It's not fast , it's , but it's nice and smooth . So here we go . Look , I've got enough leg room . Even if I sit up straight , I have got enough headroom . However , if someone's every 64 they will find the head touching . The review won't be so great for them .Still , there are some nice features in here . For instance , all the seats fold down and they split three ways . He can carry things through there , and still two people either side . Great .If you fancy a skiing trip now , let's look at the big itself capacity is actually pretty big . You could fit lots of stuff in it , however , because it shallow it does restrict . What do you actually can fit in there ?That , however , there are still some nice features in this boots of this tethering points of some storage area . Here there's a hook toe hanging shopping off . They didn't roll around . When you get in the corners on , you can release the rear seats by pulling onto these levers under here a little bit of extra storage on the classic Mercedes kind of origami box for carrying groceries . I guess now you want to see just how much stuff you can fit in this Cosby . Click it there to watch my detail . Practicality , video .You're about to see what it's like with two people in back with one large person on how easy it is to fit a child .See , it might seem a bit unnecessary to have electric tailgate for a boot on a car such as this , but really , with the Mercedes , nothing should be manual anyway .Then you could look this beautiful bottom now .Then it's time to hit the road , to see what this car's like to drive . This Mercedes E class keeper is a blooming lovely car to drive around town , so you feel cocooned from the outside world . The night speed automatic gearbox smashes gears together nice and seamlessly . There's enough punch from the engines to just hope you ahead of the riffraff , away from the lights . Then there's a suspension , which does a fabulous job of hiding out the bumps in the road . This one is on the upgraded air suspension , and it just adds an extra layer of floaty sophistication to the car . You should definitely get this because it kind of just pampers your bottom of love it now .One thing to note , though , when you drive this car in town is that it is big and the visibility is as good as in the class saloon , so that the other back window is pretty limited on this sweeping pillar . Here is quite facts close to face , so it does obscure your view . Someone , if you click up there , you can see for yourself by watching my 370Z greet Master Dr Video .You wanna head out onto a twisty road impresses button to put the car into sports mode , which firms up the suspension , but don't get too carried away because it doesn't feel quite a sport . It , um , it like the more expensive BMW . Six areas steering . It's a little bit too rubbery . Bodies still rolls through the corners . It's a It's a big old car , but that doesn't mean you can have some fun with it . You get noise flow with the actually , and it is quite satisfying . Here I am in my big Mercedes-Benz anal , that tea back to England , where this guy's most . At home , though , is on the motorway . It's a fabulous long distance cruiser , so it's super quiet to travel it .Seats are comfy .It's just got a brilliant air of luxury about it .Engines are good , too . In the UK this three choices . There's a two litre diesel , which most people probably get on . It does good economy . It's fast enough . I'd rather have the two DEA took my picture in this car because it's faster , it's smooth , and it's been fun to read it out . Now it's returning 32 miles per gallon , which isn't that great , though What's also not great that when you have the current sportsman , you put your foot down it makes this noise now the noise isn't bad , but I think it's part that's artificially produced to the car speakers . It's a little bit boy racer . Really ? For Macey's , that's just not right . You may be better off going for the three litre diesel . Yes , it's more expensive , but it does come with all wheel drive on a big V six , and it's just going to see this car so well .Nothing to note is that when you have the coin sport plus mode and you want to change gears itself manually using these paddles , it does this simulated sporty thing , boy . Jolting the gear changes . When you get this surgeon between them , it just seems a little bit wrong . I don't know why they don't know . I don't want you to know Mercedes Z8 ain't great . Turn that off , please .Right then , it's time for the car .While A5 annoying things about the Mercedes E class coupe A8 , you wouldn't expect to find a piece of plastic this flimsy and nasty , even a dacha , let alone this �40,000 Mercedes . Most the plastics in here are prison lovely , but they're brittle , hard down here , and you might touch them whenever you use the doorbell . Now this is a band to believe .This steely pectoral is pretty raptly tick over extensive it like a daisy .I do wish Mercedes-Benz stop when its signature on every car's windscreen . It's just a little bit unnecessary .These use doors are super heavy . You don't wanna get in the way when they start to close .Thankfully , the Mercedes E . Koski pay has plenty of cool features , which helped to make up for all this S5 .The definition of this reversing camera and a 360 degree surround camera is absolutely glorious .You can change the interior and V90 between lots of different colors .Well , maybe they're bright and sunny . Go for slightly yellowy orange color .Lovely . The framers doors are really cool . It's absolutely lovely when you put the windows down a little electronic butler hands in your belt when he shut the door .See the have to reach around .Green paint on this car is absolutely gorgeous .

84,106,E Class,"This is the Mercedes E class statements . Perfect if you want a luxurious , large country German car , but you also need to carry loads of stuff .But this is well , if you've ever thought those hands retail gates and a waste of time , maybe I could be no . And then I mean , the spoon is absolutely huge . There we go . Just one go always did it . We'll go anyway . Yeah , big . It's huge . It's about 10% bigger than that of a BMW five serious touring A4 II , and it's got lots of nice feature . So you got some netting here . There's no lonely and you've got scuff plate there . So when I get all this stuff about his scratch , the paintwork my God , look at covering This is CNN Moment all the way in here .Look at it's absolutely giant enormous . Look at that huge flat lobe A you've got in there back to the features . So you got 12 volts socket this places to hang stuff off under here , your little carpet . There's a huge storage area , and as ever , you get the Mercedes obligatory . Well , you're kind of basket . Put that back . So So I want to show you what it's like with seats up to bear with me for a moment . It doesn't take too long .There we go Now . If you check out the space , you'll see there's loads of it . I want to share the pulse of cover cause Handley . You have the neti section , the look of a section all in one , which makes it easier to fit . But that doesn't make it very heavy , so it could use a few bicep curls . When you try to fit , it can be a bit of a struggle , but once you got the hang of it , it's actually not too difficult . There you go , it's in , and I'll show you this as well . The way the light comes up , if I just shut this down and it quickly when you open it , Look at this . You see ? It slides up out of the way for you . That's handy .Now let's move on to the back seats side . As with the absolute and you got lots of Nero , headroom is pretty good as well . Even if you have the panoramic roof , it it take a slight problem , I think , is that these seats do seem quite low , so you're needed quite high and your bottoms a bit lower , so it's no ideal on Dhe . The seat bench isn't quite as deep as unavailable , if I see so it's not quite comfy for long journeys as a fighter's . I don't think in the back if you're carrying two people . If you can M3 , it's actually better because this middle seat it's quite low . Widen Squidgy in the cars fairly wise . It's actually pretty good for three , I think better in the fire . Siri's if you want to carry three to seek some other features in the back here .So , yes , you pulled this down . You then have come on . You know you're in there . Don't be shy . It's a little cup holders . They're quite goes on . That's what that was for . Actually , that it's an extra could be space . If you want to carry longer items and some people in the back , you can fold down this seat and I don't know how to do it . It is That's how you did it . So , yeah , you can carry ski's whatever to people in the back . You need to carry children . The eyes fixed anchor points just to hear the war . No , these covers are quite used to lose . Now , if you want to see some more information on this car's practicality , click it there to watch my detailed video .You can see how much stuff I could come into this cause boot .We'll start with three people in the back and how easy it is to get a child seat .So under the front from the driver's point of view , the estate is identical to the saloon , you know , and it's a very , very nice place to bay . I really like the design . It's a very nice , cool desire that that events the way you can get this ward on the dash . It's really , really tasteful . Quality is very good as well , though , don't it ? It's quite good .Isn't a BMW G5 Siri's touring that brings you into the entertainment system so standard you get a smaller screen in this and you don't get digital dolls ?You have to upgrade to the biggest screen . If you're having a four cylinder engine . Car six cylinder has this bigger screen is standard .But then he said after grade to the digital dolls in terms of the infotainment system itself , This is like a say , the upgraded command online and you know it's all right . It's okay . It's just not as nice to use has been to lose . I drive . I don't think the graphics are quite sharp , though . One problem I do have with it is that they control of this . The design of it just gives you rs . I It's not that comfy .Can't complain about the copy spaces . They got huge door bins , the glove boxes . Bigas . Well , you got more storage into here , and it's quite a practical car here in the front . And I like this feature so electrically operated steering column , Because why should you do things manually in a Mercedes ? Absolutely . No doubt , that righteous with me .Okay , that's the war ground bit dealt with . Now it's time to hit the road , to see what this car is like to drive . It's quite nice car to drive in town this week .Last part of the reason is that you're just so well isolated from the outside world . It's got really good sound proofing , so it's as if nothing's going on outside it all . It's really , really quiet and relaxing does the visibility .It's It's okay , you know , it's a big car . S6 will be hard to maneuver in tight spaces , but the back window . It's a reasonable size , and it's not too many big blind spots . And if you like it there , you can see yourself by joining me for a 360 degree passenger right video , this ecosystem is a brilliant , brilliant long distance cruiser .It's just so super comfy on the motorway as standard or cars get Espenson the back . This one has the upgraded all round air suspension on it just glides .It just rides super quite as well when you just cruising the engine in this car is the too late diesel . It's actually all you really need . So I'm doing 50 miles an hour on a floor it .And now I'm doing 70 easily quick enough , and it was really well with this very responsive , yet smooth seven speed automatic gearbox wants faster , yet you can get a B six days or but you don't need it . You can also get a high performance petrol as well in the E 63 AMG , but that's gonna be very thirsty . This diesel , supposedly 57 miles per gallon X1 Air is doing 43 All right .Interestingly , for this estate version , E class Mercedes has fitted some extra bracing to it on . The upshot of that is that it seems to just handle better than this early , which is bizarre . It's not the other way around . The estates just feel a bit more ponderous , but this one There's better driving e class estate like a lunatic round the bends . But if you go quickly will hold on , it's quite surprising by the Audi to back off should be a bit more civilized when driving any class .Yeah , that's better Now then it's time for the car A5 annoying things about this car .What is it with Mercedes and these fake exhaust outlets ? There's nothing but black this'll .Cheap trip seems like it's come from some child's plasticky toy . In fact , the design of this mimics some form of radio controlled roadway .You wanna normally cuts a state with a petrol engine In the UK , you can only get petrol engine in one of the sporty .For some reason , the AMG line version of state doesn't get riel lead on its each . Like the S8 version , it gets fake leather .If you want real leather , you have to upgrade to the �1600 nappa .Leather is quite nice .Annoyingly , you can't put the load cover at the way underneath the force . You have to carry it in the boot , and that's it . Pretty much full night . Actually , that's it . Definitely A4 .Thankfully , this car has plenty of cool features , which helps make up for all this . Hey , S5 .There's an elongated bracket for the seat backs , which will pop up , and then we put back has it more upright .So you include the boots based by 30 liters . Definition of the reversing camera is so high that you can probably make out all my wrinkles , huh ? Damn Mercedes .By pressing this button here , the driver could actually control the passenger seat . Look , that's why the camera's moving now is not the guy around .Slider Mercedes-Benz Ik A6 State can carry 745 kilos in its boot , which is 10 times the weight of May .The semi autonomous driving function effectively lets the car drive itself on my own on the motorway , but also at slow speeds in town . So it does all the breaking on the accelerating . And , of course , the steering . You do because you have to touch your standing world to let you know you're still there .

85,107,GLA,"This is the new Mercedes G L A .And I know what you're thinking . Yeah , it looks rather like the old ML class . That's because , actually , that's what is underneath . Almost a dozen Dunne is taking that car . Give it some new bumpers .Give it that new names that fits into the rest of the model range . Naming sister Andi . Yeah , essentially , that has enabled them to extend the car's best before date .Same story inside , actually rather similar to the old ML class . But there are just a few updates .So the most notable one is this iPad stall screen to get up there , which is like that on this C class . Not to seek us , though a standard .You get the higher level command now the system , But if I'm brutally honest , it's still not the best invitation system to use . You control it with his touch pad . It's all a bit awkward in the menu . Systems can be a touch confusing , and if you want to see our full review of it , then click up there on the banner for an in depth review of the entertainment system and have another look around this car's cabin and you'll notice that actually , well feels really high quality .Now this is the AMG line version , and it's absolutely load in the kit .So this car does cost �60,000 right ?That's for the car with the three litre diesel engine .But looking at these kids , look at that . I mean , they've had to use the smallest font possible that I can't read it without a magnifying glasses . That much kit on this car and it is , it's It's really nice . It feels expensive . It doesn't quite the same possessions is the new Mercedes E Class . But it stood the test of time pretty well , This current side , and it's very , very practical .You got huge door bins there on a decent size glove box . It's perfect if you want to get one of those super sized drinks from McDonald's or Burger King or need to carry a thermos flask because you've got such a large cup holders cars really practical in the back seats as well .So there's absolutely loads of knee room loads of headroom . Despite that glass roof , Bigfoot world or very spacious , I can even recline the seat backs . We've got them fully reclined already There are a few problems , though .For instance , well , there's no ski hatch in this particular car . Really Should be .And then there's this middle seat . If you need to carry three , see you go a big , spacious carpet . This middle seat is just so much harder than the other seats . The person who sits is not going to be very happy for very long .Yeah , another thing that I find a little bit annoying about his car is if you want to fold the seats down , you have to flip out with seats squad first before you fold Seat back down , which is just a little bit old fashioned once in this culture in its age .Now , in terms of the boot , There we go . We got an automated tailgate , and it's a good one because it doesn't seem to , like get fazed if you try and open it too hard , like some of the freeze face . There we go . Whoa , look it up . It's absolute Lee massive . With the seats down , it's especially large , and you have a completely flat load bay as well if you look down there and there's no load lit . The only problem I have . Is this because his bumper sticks out , you do have to lift off over that first before you can slide it into the boot . There are very storage areas . He got net there . You got some commie space there and huge under floor storage as well . It's just a shame that its not quite big enough to put the past her shelf under there , though at least is part yourself is nice and light and easy to remove . This is one big , practical kind of want to find out just how much you can fit in the proof of this car . Click up there on the banner to watch an in depth practicality video , and you'll also be able to see how easy it is to fit a child .See in the car on just what happened when we tried to squeeze three people in the back seats .So then what ? Mercedes-Benz like road on the whole jelly is a pretty nice car to drive , so like I say it is , it's very quiet . Whatever speed you're doing , it's comfy , too , but especially this version on air suspension car normal suspension can feel a little bit too , actually , in terms of cornering . Well , it goes all right , you know , you gotta accept that . It's a big old cards , it feels , but it holds on to the corners well enough . It's just that something like a Porsche came will definitely kick . It's big old ass through the twisted . It's one thing I can't complain about is a nine speed gearbox . It's really , really good on this engine .The three liter V six diesel has plenty of performance . I think it's reasonable economy , so Mercedes-Benz it'll be able to do around 40 miles per gallon on according to the trick computer . Doing 38 miles per gallon thing is that you might be better off game for the cheaper to 0.1 liter diesel engine in the daily to 50 D because it's not quite smooth .But it's cheaper to buy a better economy , and the performance I get from it is actually pretty decent . But what else is decent visibility ? So you see that pretty high in this car on you got a big back window back pillars on too obtrusive because you've got these rear quarter lights which give you visibility , where you looking out over his shoulder and click it there on the card you can see for yourself by what you might in debt 300D 60 degree video .There is one thing that I don't like too much about . This car is . Perhaps the steering is just feels a little bit kind of weird and artificial , almost like it's been taking from a PlayStation game . On the whole , the jelly is pretty easy to get along with .Does have a few traits . Is A5 .This number keypad is like off some old mobile phone just shows . His car's just over this horrendously cheap plastic .It has no business being on a car that costs �60,000 .Horrible thes exhaust pipes actually faked the rial X6 diesel exhaust .The forces that these legends is a little bit noises . That's a good excuse to treat yourself to this 600 days away .The optional running boards will do to get back to the treasures . You get the car . You .Thankfully , the G L E does have a few features which make up for all this .You can start the cars climbing . Try using a smartphone outside the right temperature for when you get in it .Today , I'm going to call the car control to 3.5 turns , which is the same weight as a hippo . The I'm assuming that's a consenting .Rather than resisting him with the active curve control , the car can actually lean into corners like a motorbike . MG line models come with air suspension , a standard , and it makes this noise when it releases the pressure with college . It's my government .You can get the seven speed automatic gearbox with a low ratio move for some serious off roading . Hoo rah !So then , overall , what don't think of the Mercedes G L E .Well , it's entertainment system is a bit feeling to use on that central receipt is a touch uncomfortable .But for everyone else , this is a really configured to travel in Andi .It's hugely practical . Never click it .They can get more information and find out the best deal . You can get a Mercedes jelly car . Wow , Darko , don't you , Kay ?Thanks for watching . Enjoy this video , please .

86,108,S Class ,"This is the Mercedes S class coupe A8 , and it's a little bit like the iconic Barcelona chair in the way that it's super stylish . It's luxurious on Dhe is extremely comfortable now . Mercedes , as recently updated it , so it's got a new rail . It's got new tail light's new color . Well designs . There's also a new engine Onda New Steering Wheel . I'm more on that later .Like the boss literature , this car is raw , that expensive , so it starts from �105,000 but you can save an average of almost �23,000 or one through car . Wow . So if you're thinking about buying a new car , click on the pop out a bun in the top right hand corner the screen to see how much you can say for a new car through our website .So then let's start this review by talking about this new steering wheel . It's a saying that you get in the S class and it's lovely to hold .It's also got all the controls for the cost technology , so this right hand section here allows me to control the digital drivers display so I could sweat through the right hand dial and go from the normal tachometer through to a sat nav map , my ICO performance G Force meter . I can then move into the central dollar , and that has all my driving days and stuff like that . Or if I pressed the home button , I convince went through all the main functions of the central entertainment system . However , I can also operate them through the main invitations from which I control with this side of the steering wheel . It's got all the usual functions that you expect . I've got navigation with a nice big widescreen map . Radio media , If wanna stream music through the car for a telephone , my connection facilities or like Android Auto and Apple carplay also got Internet connectivity . Then we have vehicle control so I can go through various functions , such as the ambient lighting settings actually have 64 different ambient lighting colors , as well as using these controls here . I could actually use this swivel or down here or this touch pad , but the positioning of it is a bit with RS I . Thankfully , there are some shortcut buttons around here , which would make it easier . Generally , I think the system is very , very good , not quite as good as BMW Zay drive . Yes , I know , I always say that , but it is the truth on for my D told Entertainment Video Review . Click on the pop up on the top right hand corner the screen . I'm going to further detail on the system of what's good and what's not so good about it . If you don't use any of these control input methods , you could just press a button appear for voice commands . On this 450 different commands this system understand ? So massage seats reported the massage seats , and then I could just choose which one I want . Well , there doesn't appear to be one that has a happy ending . Looks like Mercedes-Benz Mr Trickier .Still , standard equipment is very good , and the massage seats are included A standard , though , to be honest , massive seating cause on that great other kid you get includes panoramic sunroof .Yeah , it's nice .That is , I do like it also like the fact that you got this little air blower here , which blows warm air and the back your neck great in winter . So to the heated seats , and they do get very warm . But you've also got called ventilated seats , obviously the seeds of fully electric . And look at this . You can even lower and raise the head rest electrically . Of course , it's a Mercedes . Same thing with the steering column . So you just control it electrically as well .You also get a bird , Mr . Sound System . This car actually has graded three Debo Mr System . But you don't really need it because the standard one is easily good enough . Other options fitted to this particular car include fine apple leather for the seats .Oh , yeah , it does feel lovely , but it costs �6000 extra . So you definitely want to go on call ? Whoa ! A7 shoot concert from the car . So , for instance , this S5 60 premium AMG line upload the details into car . Wow . And it should cost about �110,000 . But I've gone off the back for just over �91,000 you can spend some more options , Can't you such as these Would in lays only 500 quid and they do look nice .Not sure about how they match up in color to this leather on the dash , but general do like the overall look . This kind of wave of loveliness that goes to the car and generally quality is good as well . These events that Phil metal and rope bossed what's even nicer are these buttons for the climate control . They're just metallic feeling , and so are the window switches as well . It's lovely , but there are a few cheap pieces of plastic , which let the side down . For instance , these door handle inserts they're really cheap , and you may touch those the events around here in the back cheap plastic as well . Release buttons for the center console . Really cheap , nasty plastic . But the worst offender is this fake bitter crystal down here . Looks like it's come have a Christmas cracker , not call that costs over �100,000 .The storage is better than you get with a Christmas cracker , so there's little area , heavy keys and 12 volt socket . This little compartment here , maybe for you cigars , or if you're trying to give up smoking your chocolate bar , you got some deep cup holders as well , which is good because it means that they can hold the tall of bottles on the door . Bends are so huge that can carry two bottles of water . You got big storage area here as well . You can't see from there . So don't worry . I can actually open it this way . How clever is that ? You might notice that there's some US beat inputs there for charging . Your mobile device is on that sign . There isn't for yet espresso . It actually means near field communication so it can actually boost the signal from your mobile phone .

And then you will need to go see a problem . ASU's for a problem , My Sarge . You're able to just rely on those seats .So let's move on to the boot . Now . The capacity of this guy's about 25% less in the S Class saloon , but it's still about the same size as an A class , and it's a bit bigger than a Bentley Continental GT . His boot or models come with an electrically operated delegate . Obviously , on both sides , as you can see is decent enough on the opening quite wide for a coup pays boot .

Classic Mercedes . If you want the 360 degree camera or the heated arm rests and steering wheel , which you probably do , you can only get them is part of the premium package , which costs �5000 because it includes a lot of other kids you don't actually want , such as this weird , well being spoiled recreation thing with some kind of scent , which is blown through the air vents over a mistake on various settings , which is supposed to be you .And you have to be careful with open these big , heavy doors on a slope because he let go , then they could do some damage .Thankfully , this car has plenty of cool features to help make up for all this . His five .The washer jets for the windscreen wipers are actually housed in the blades themselves , so you don't get big squirt of water of the windscreen , which means that your vision is never impaired .You get the call was in court magic body control .

87,109,GLC,"compact premium SUV's their cars of the moment where they use for the daily commute or the school run . They are the fashion statement you can justify to your family , but which you choose between the revised Range Rover Evoque BMW X3 on the all new Mercedes GLC to help you decide I'm gonna compare .Their design is it's just more Victoria Beckham than Kate Middleton .Test what they like to drive . Where's the drama ? Where's the excitement ?See how practical they are ?It's easier for old dogs pen and finally examine what you get for your money .So let's start with a styling . Because while these cars are practical , really , their premium badges and lawfully right height all about moving you up in the motoring class system . Now of all the cars , it's the Mercedes , which does this best . It just has an innate authority of presence there . There's a sort of aristocratic air about it .This is the AMG line model , and it has all the bells and whistles . But extra bits of trim are really just the icing on a very upmarket Battenberg cake . The VOCs designed really caused a stir when it was first released , more than four years ago on Land Rover , has recently fitted a new bumper and lights to keep it looking fresh but listening a little bit more footballers wives about this car . Compared to the regal Mercedes , it's just more Victoria Beckham than Kate Middleton . Meanwhile , the BMW extreme is the C list celebrity of the group . It just gets less attention than the stylish Mercedes in the head turning rain . Drover adding names Walt Package , with its large events and those big wheels does the drama slightly , but only to daytime soap opera levels on inside . The plot's a bit predictable to the design is rather dated and , let's be honest , a tad dull , to be fair .Build quality is strong , and the entertainment system is by far the slickest and most user friendly . Here . The menus are clear and logical . On the swivel Will controller is effortless to use . The same can't be said for the vote , though despite being knew , the system is still a bit slow to respond on being a touch screen . It's harder to operate while driving shame , really , as the rest of the votes cabin is effortlessly simplistic and easy to use .Okay , so the feeling of quality is a little bit more superficial than in the BMW , but can't fault this drive in position . It says that I'm sat in a sports car on stilts stepping to the Mercedes , though , and it feels in a different league , combining both style on substance . You also get the sense it's human from granite .The only *** in the armor is the entertainment system , so navigating the menus is more difficult than in the BMW on its with boiled touch .But system Mercedes-Benz not win the tech battle , but it does come out on top for practicality . This plaintiff in car storage , it can fit two liter bottles in all four doors .The GLC also has the best rear seats with loads of room even for tour adults on , it's wide enough to carry three in the back in moderate comfort . Fitting a child seat is a breeze , too , because the ice affix anchors are easy to locate and this plenty of room to maneuver .Also , the boot is pretty big on this nice features , like a lockable floor for storing valuables , but she also has room to store the parcel shelf . What's more , you get three way folding seats with electric releases . Total volume is 1600 liters on . With the seats in place , there's still 550 litres capacity . The only annoying thing is the high load floor . The baby . Really extras is actually lower , so it's easier for old dogs . Leap in the boot does like some of the clever features of the Mercedes . The exact capacity is on a par with the Mercedes , though , but the shape of the extras boot means you can squeeze just a little bit . Maurine in car .Could be space is a good but trail .The Mercedes slightly fitting a child seat isn't quite as easy , either . As the ice affix , anchors are hidden on the rear . Doors don't open quite as wide . And while the backseats are very spacious , even for tall adults , there's a tad less shoulder room for three than in the GLC . But on the whole , it's a very close thing between the Merc and the BMW . Their vote is a lot smaller in the back in the other two , and the foot walls are an awkward shape . They end up constantly adjusting your feet to try and get comfortable , almost like well , you need the toilet . The narrow body means three in the back is a really squeeze on toilet . People will always struggle with knee room fitting . A child seat isn't quite as easy as in the other two , due to the small door openings or in car storage is less plentiful .The bigger problem is boot space , which trails the Mercedes on BMW significantly .But then that's down to the evokes position in the market as a slightly smaller vehicle positioned in between the BMW X3 on the X1 . And , of course , there's always the Landrover Discovery sport if it's at right space you want . But that's a seven season here . We're looking at five seater cars , and there's one way to your vote could save face time for a little competition .Welcome to the car while boot race , where we're gonna find out which of these three cars has the fastest automated tailgate . So 321 open Well , the ever gets off to a flying start . But the BMW catcher now , But I think it's just people in the post , and yes , he does . So there we go , the pin to the X3 one , followed by the Range Rover Evoque , which I declare water over the Mercedes .So the vote came second in that race . For when it comes to driving off road , it would be first followed by the Mercedes over . We are testing that here because the reality is most SUV drivers never actually go off road . Well , they certainly won't in this because it's the front wheel drive only model . I know what you're thinking . Anything . Well , I definitely need the four wheel drive . But you don't trust me .You and you really don't on dhe , it might only be powered by the lowest powered version of land drivers knew Tulio Diesel . Burke 150 horsepower . That's quick enough on Dhe . It's economical , Frances . I'm averaging 50 War mpg in a Range Rover . Okay , so I think it's the least dynamically sophisticated of the three cars .But bizarrely , it's actually the most fun . You said the stereo so fast to the point of being flighty , this gear shift as a short throw and Nazi filter , which is quite refreshing , and you generally feel connected to the road on the card you could feel exactly what it's doing is it's moving about beneath you , squirming as it's trying to hold onto the road . Yes , I've been to be X3 will corner faster than it , but it just seems more involving . But it's not so involving that .It gets tiresome mean for me the only real problems They were the awful rear visibility and the fact they get quite a lot of wind .With so whipped up by those big door mirrors , the BMW isn't the quietest , either . They mainly due to the racket its tires make .Also , it sort of fidgets about like its pants over smaller bumps and then convulses over bigger ones . It's it's clear that this guy's been set up with firm suspension , so it handles as well as it possibly can . And that's that's all well and fine on super smooth German roads . But , yes , not so good in the UK , where we don't repair our roads when they get damaged . Thing is , though , you know you can get around the problem by fitting this car with the optional end sport adaptive suspension , and then it's got comfort mode on then .Well , Roy is actually pretty good now this car that I'm driving his ex that you d so it's got a three litre diesel engine , which is well , when you put your foot down , it is ballistic fast . The only problem is it makes a racket like a V one rocket when you accelerate or so that's not gonna be very good for your economy . In fact , I'm only averaging 35 miles per gallon . And to be fair , I think most people be better off saving some money getting the two litre diesel cause it's cheaper and slightly more economical . If you get that engine , make sure you get the automatic gearbox because it's brilliant on the manual . Well , not so much . And that brings us on to the Mercedes , which takes a totally different approach than the other two .First you think this this is a little bit bland . Steering the brakes , the slasher gearbox . This'd A8 suspension . I don't really feel anything . Okay , goes around corners as well as ever needs to , but I want Maur .And then after an hour on the motorway , followed by another hour queuing in stationary traffic , you finally get it . The GLC has been specifically set up to detach you from the sensation of driving Yes , it's no . But sometimes numbness could be a good thing . Like in the dentist's . On Modern motoring has been like pulling teeth , and you can think of the jail . See a soothing Nova Cain .Anything that you notice when you put your foot down . The 2.1 liter diesel makes a bit of a worrying sound , like the dentist drill , but I can't fault it's performance . It's got 204 horsepower on DDE on returning 48 mpg , which is pretty incredible , and that brings us on to costs .Focus . The least expensive of the three . It starts from �30,600 that you'll need to pay from �33,200 if you want for will drive . BMW X3 range begins at �33,945 while the Mercedes GLC 34,950 . So where does that leave us ?What each of these cars has something that makes him stand out .So with the evoke , it's it's striking design .The BMW has a sport is drive .But when you think about what premium compact SUV is all about , it's the Mercedes , with its blend of luxury family friendly nurse on relaxing drive , which means it wins this test .Take over there to watch in debt video reviews of each of the cars in this group test .

88,110,GLC,"This is the Mercedes GLC on its arrival for the BMW X3 on the Audi Q5 , and even pretty much think of it as a C class on stilts , clearly an inferior product . Thankfully , this isn't it's a really , really upmarket vehicle . It's absolutely gorgeous inside .In fact , if you spent a lot of time in this car , you get so used to the luxury that you find it difficult to go into your home on equipment is pretty good , so that jealousy is a little bit more expensive than its rivals .But you do get quite a lot of kids are standard , such as man made leather on . If I didn't tell you that it was manly , you probably would never know . You also get electrically operated seats on their heated as well , Which is nice .However , if you want satin , have you do have to pay extra for it on the base model on Dhe , there's two types right . There's a garment satnav , which is not really very becoming of a Mercedes . And then there's the more expensive Mercedes-Benz and system , which from brutally honest , it's not as good as those offered by Audi or BMW . Now , if you click on the card in the top right hand corner of the screen . You can see our in depth review of the entertainment system and have another look around this car's glorious cabin .And it really noticed then that the well , the kombi space is actually really good .But that's not what your bride jail . So you bought it for its image . Really , This is a car that totally stands out from whichever angle you're looking at it from the front , the sides , the black oh , especially the back . It just it just screams quality .Also standard or models get an electrically powered tailgate , which seems to take an absolute age to open . But once opened , the boot is really , really practical , and it's got a couple of really cool features that I like . So the 1st 1 is the fact that look , you've got a lockable false floor so you can hide away your valuables . Another neat thing is that the parcel shelf is easy to remove on DDE . We're not used , you can fit it under There is great . This car has no load lifter . The only problem is , is that the low tide is quite high so it's gonna be a bit of an effort for your old dog to leap into the back . You won't find this an effort , though . Falling down the rear seats just a flick of a button . It's just so simple . Mercedes-Benz your life easier . There we go , and then you got a nice big flat lobe .A very practical car actually extends to the back seats , so we just hop in and I'll put these chairs black , and you will see that I have loaded nearing leads of Henry , and people over six foot will be absolutely happy back here on . Do you know if there's any two of you ? You can fold this down , rest of wrong on it . Lift it up . You got some extra storage . But if there's no you need to carry three is perfectly doable in here . Yes , there's been humping the floor , but that's what was a really large And because of so much headroom , look , the Middle C is actually surprisingly comfortable on If you want to see just what it's like with three people in the back , click in the top right hand corner of the screen on the card index practicality video , and you're able to see just how easy it is to fit baby sitting here on dhe how much stuff we could actually fit in the jail sees boot S8 has filled the GLC with technology , and here's a run through of five call features .Jail is the only car in its class available with air suspension , but it is expensive . The cross wind assists prevent sudden gusts from blowing you off course .The blind spot monitoring with active State prevented drifting into other cars already saved me .He wants the location . The gear selector on the steering column is really handy .The Afro pack includes five murders , including incline , slippery and rocking assist .However , the GLC isn't perfect . Here's five things which answer cool about this SUV .The black piano plastic may look great when you , but it scratches easily .You end up hurting the backs of travelers on the road . Be bored when you go to get out .That is under the touch pad , and the swivel will a little bit all gonna give you all rights .I the automatic gearbox , sometimes jerk slightly when changing down at low speeds . A lot at the moment . The car is currently only available with the 2.1 liter diesel engine in the UK , does have to power . If you on petrol power , you can get a six . Lend a three liter in the sporty AMG GLC 43 that brings us on how the GLC feels when you hit the road .Jealousy is based on the C class , and as you'd expect it , it's pretty good to drive . This is not perfect , though . For instance , while the suspension on hold is very , very comfortable . Occasionally get this this slight rocking sensation when you go over certain bumps . Another thing is that the controls , the steering and the brakes they're just a little bit numb on that . Is that you know , really encouraged to push it to the corners like you would a BMW X3 . To be fair , though , it's still handles well enough , and I think that this jail sees well . It's laid back approach really suits SUV's now the jealousy . It might be a big car , but it's actually pretty easy to drive in time because sit up , I .It's easy to judge where the corners of the car if you want to have a look at the visibility yourself . Click in the top right hand corner of the screen on the car to watch our 360 degree video , and you'll notice that the only real blind spot is the fat rear pillar .One area where this jealousy really stands out is soundproofing because it's noticeably quieter than its rivals .In fact , the ambiance is only dented slightly when you put your foot down in the grumbly 2.1 liter diesel roars into life . But then , when you back off again , it seems subsides and , well , anyway , Mercedes-Benz this engine would do not 16 7.5 seconds on return , 56 mpg on DDE . In the real world , I'm actually averaging 48 months for Galan .So then overall , what I think of the Mercedes GLC well , the entertainment system is a little bit confusing and at 2.1 liter diesel , a touch noisy .But this car is super stylish , and it's really relaxing to travel in Now .If you click it there , you can get more information and find out the best deal you can get on a jail .

Go for sport , plus the exhausted getting louder my seats , which you do by pressing that take control with the gearbox .

With options , it's 56 �56,000 worth of options on it , such as these lovely nappa leather seats .You'll notice the design of this car . The inside is not quite modern . As the latest Mercedes-Benz look down here . The buttons , they're all a bit cluttered . There's a lot going on , and the dial's feel a little bit on the cheap side . Rest of the quality on the dash , soft materials fairly nice , and it's sturdy the entertainment system looks a little bit offset .Can you see it in line up properly and you can control it using the wheel down there . I don't think it's the easiest system to operate on . You have to pay extra if you want command online navigation �2000 . You don't get setting up a standard on any of these cars . You can't have a cheaper Becker system , but it's not particularly good anyway .Let's get back into the driving . So this is a front engine , rear wheel drive sports car , but it doesn't feel the sport is of sports cars . TT . Even the front wheel drive version of the Audi TT does feel more sporting to drive .This particular car has the �1000 dynamic handing package of grade , which is well worth it . So when you press that dynamic mode get to the different options , it alters not just the steering and the noise of the exhaust in the throat response . But it also changes the stiffness in the suspension . I didn't comfort mode . It's more comfortable than the normal S L C , and in dynamic mode sport mode , it's for S O handles better and it makes it more comfortable . It's well worth the upgrade . Even side . This car doesn't feel quite fidgety over bumps in the road he might build to notice . It's bouncing around quite a bit , and you did get quite a lot of shimmy and shake the body as it flexes over bumps . Does feel a little bit old now , this car I'm just gonna stop . The reason gonna stop is that you absolutely , positively have to stop .If you want to put the reef up , you can't operate the reef . If the car is moving , put the reef up . Don't you see what it's like with the roof up ? This is the mechanism working away . Now I can actually drive the car for a bit so you could drive up to 25 miles an hour once the roof is moving on operational . But to initiate it , you do have to stop , so that's a bit of a pay . So let's go .One of the good things about this car being a hard top is the fact that it just feels like a normal coop A8 when you're driving with the reef up , so it's nice and quiet inside you feel secure , My gosh , start to rain .I timed that perfectly . Look at that . It's a bit of luck . This nice speed automatic gearbox is pretty good . So when he just cruising around , it's nice and relaxing . When you want to take control yourself in the puddles , you can . Lower powered cars are available with a manual gearbox is going to save some cash , but I don't know the mandolin this car at all . I think it's a little bit sponging robbery . It's much better soon . Hear this cartoon , the automatic go back into comfort mode , now just chilled . Hello , There we go . It's much better in comfort mode when you're on a bumpy road and then you can just cruise around . You kind of get the feeling this is more of a cruiser than our Internet sports car . A Porsche Boxster will run rings around this thing .Yeah , the Porsche is way more fun . If you're not driving the Porsche , you haven't tested it . You won't know and you'll be more than happy with this . Quick it does . You feel low to the ground like expect from a sports car .It's all right , you know when you consider the discounts you can get in this car now because it's quite old based pretty much on the s . Okay , they just changed the name to S L . C . And it's a design tweaks because of that , because it's no car . You get incredible disco . So on car Wow , this car , this 56,000 bank are with options . I expect it up in a dealer offered May 1 brand new �41,000 . Then will the killing . It seems kind of decent value . The entry level SLC 1 80 with 1.6 turbo engine that starts with �32,000 but with a common discount . You're looking up �23,000 . That is in X5 money there .And I think a lot of people rather have Mercedes-Benz a master , even though the master is actually slightly better to drive anyway , I think that's that . Then Ugo jump out that you haven't got a car with its roof do up very good . You enjoyed that ? No driving the car .I'm another good look around the cabin and the very old roof up .So you press this button on the roof goes darker , press it again and it will go lighter .

Thankfully , there is a grab handle , like in the old G wagon for your passenger . Not really need . That gives us something to hold onto when you go off , roading them on that later .So like I say and this guy's got a retro exterior design . But here on the inside , it's completely modern on the interior is dominated by these two huge digital screens .So the one for the driver on this G 63 which is standard by the way , On this particular car , you can swipe through different menus and views . You can even change the look between sport Classic and something called progressive . I think I'll stick with sport . I can also control the main entertainment functions through this system as well or through the big screen . Here , though , I operate that using the left side of butter . And , yeah , you can sweat through all the different menus . It's all very easy to do , or I can use this swivel well down here in the touch batter import stuff . But that's not so easy to do , because the last of it awkward to operate on . There are , of course , voice commands as well . If you want to use those instead , it's a little bit of a shame that it doesn't have Mercedes-Benz m B u ex operating system , because that is really good to get in the A Class B . Then getting in this you do have Android auto on Apple carplay as standard . It's an easy to use . Just plug in your phone and it comes up . The only problem is , is that you then don't get the four screen . You only get part of screwing . The rest of it is just like blank with Android or what's written on it also have noticed with this particular car , it sometimes just randomly disconnect , have to reconnect it , or when you listen to spotify , it's sometimes just clips the tracks . It's like it just loses connection for a split second , which is a little bit annoying , I'll tell you something else . There's a little bit annoying as well . Your cable for this , which leads into the central cubby . There's no actual place for you to thread it through . You cannot suppose . Squeeze it through there . But it's like Mercedes-Benz really thought about that , particularly because the code is actually a decent size loved store , lots of different things in their glove box . That's reasonable as well . There's some little coin holders . They're those type of people who are going to drive this car more right to put the sovereigns for their rings in there . Other could be space . A pretty good look . Door bins . I can fit one , two , three bottles in there and generally , actually , the quality in this car is really , really nice to have a look around .It just feels high class . So you got metallic switches here for the climate control off on a W . C . Clock down here , you got metallic trim about the place . It feels very nice , as did the solid metal paddle shifters for the automatic gearbox . Like the wood trim effect on this car as well . However , there are a few pieces that just let this summer it down a touch the window switches . The cheap plastic was in the S class , which is a less expensive vehicle , that metallic also Look at this . The sun visor is like something out of a �15,000 corner . 150 grand car . Then look at the cheap plastic here . That's awful . Were they thinking about fit in that there ? But then the rest of it is lovely .On dhe , you get nappa leather a standard , though these are rated nappa leather seats with quilted effect . An extended leather throughout the cabin . Let's repair on the dash . Get it all the way down here and you get these quilted inserts their leather even down here on the lower part of the door .It's lovely . Without grade . Does cost a lot it �5000 . That means you're gonna want to save some cash on this car . So I pour to the details of this particular car into car . Whoa , ongoing offer back on this car for �137,000 . Now , if you'd like to try a configuration , click on the papa banged up , then that's not lie in court of the screen to get a car and into the details of any car and see how much money you can save on it . And of course , you can use that saving to buy some more options .And one option I wouldn't spend X1 on this car is the MG drivers package , because what it does is increase . The car stops speed from 137 miles an hour to just 149 but it costs �2000 .And actually , I don't really need to spend on any options because this car is so well equipped , for instance , as standard , and you get adaptive led headlights yet 20 inch alloy wheels adjustable suspension .You also get heated on dhe called front seats .Whether you want a hot ass or a cold bought , you can decide yours against friends and 60 degree camera on DDE , a glass sunroof .One option you may want , though , is adjustable lumbar support for your back because it doesn't come a standard , which is a little bit odd , because this kind of price especially get things like electric steering column . There is absolutely loads of adjustment in it . In fact , this new G class is actually longer , wider and taller than the old one . It means there's loads more space here in the front , and even if you're small , you can really jack up the seat to get good view out . There's still plenty of head room , if you really told you can go lower . But what's it like in the back ? Because the old Carl was absolutely terrible ? Well , one thing I will point out is the fact the rear doors don't open all that wise . It can be a bit . Or could any first light training maneuver charts see ? And thankfully , though , the eyes are fixed points of really easy to get out there exposed , that's no problem . It's more of a problem . Once again , he's getting it right . As you can see , though , once you're in Oh my gosh , loads of head room . You could be well over six foot tall . You'll be fine . Knee room is decent as well . Now you can stretch your feet out some way , but then there's like a thing underneath the front seat that you can't go any further . So that's it . It's not fully like a limousine in the back , but it's comfy enough on . I can't complain about this . Look . Huge rear windows . The ledge is low , so kids were built to say very easily . Also , there's big windows just behind you , which helped make it feel like near in here . Despite all the black trim of this particular car , makes you think that this is gonna be a seven seater . But no , it's not . It's a strict five seater . Now , if you want to carry five once , it's doable because his car is so wide . Yes , the middle seat is a little bit harder and raised up in the outer , too . But the floor's pretty flat . There's loads of room for everyone's feet . You can carry three people in the back here , no problem at all . On dhe , people can keep comfortable as well , because you've got your own climate control back here .There's also some events here in this pillar to blow cool or hot air on your face , depending on what you want , that some of the features down here look , you've got a charging point there , a 12 volt socket . There's a little I suppose that's an ashtray vel . Maybe you can leave your candy sticks in there . There's another storage . Well , you have some airplane style pockets on the back of the front seat , so different , a little bit flimsy . Got some big door bins down here once again , with more than enough space for a small bottle such as this under some other creature comforts as well . For instance , look , I've got heated rear seats here on the quality back here . You know , it's the same as in the front . You don't feel like you're in the cheap seats if you want to . You can carry longer writers because you can fall down this hatch , open this door , and then you can carry ski's and two people either side , if that's what you want to do . There's also some cup holders there .As you can see , if you want to carry items in the boot and I need a bit more space , you can ask your rear passengers sit more of pride because it does increase the low capacity . But people really don't wanna travel like that . Aren't they really , she carrying really large items you're gonna need to fold the seats down and to do it . A two stage process , which is a bit of a fast these days for these seat backs . They do lie flat . The problem is that you have this huge ridge here . Now it's gonna be really hard to push heavy items right to the front of the car . Now let's talk about the actual boot space , so this door opens sideways , so it's really awkward to do in tight spaces . Also , it's really heavy because you got that spare with on the back of this There , you got the quilting here . That's really nice now . What's not so nice , though , is the fact that you really do have to kind of lift things up quite a way to get them into this . Because unlike a Range Rover , there's no air suspension , so you can't lower the car down to make that easier . Also , the tow hitch it's fixed . It's not retractable once again , like it's retractable on a Range Rover that we can still toe the same 3.5 tons . This car's that's pretty good , but also pretty good is that there's no lower lip . So once you've got things appear , there is enough to slide in on this very tender points around the place . You got 12 volt socket here as well . You've also got a boot liner there to keep it nice and clean . Z8 don't dirty the carpet . Unfortunately , under there , there's no extra storage , which is annoying because really , you could do is somewhere to put the removable parcel shelf . So now it's just kind of lay like that . Maybe I see what's going on because I want to show you the boot size yet . It's very big , but it's not quite as big as a Porsche Cayenne . You might be wondering what the heck this bag is . Well , actually , more on that later in the video is the last thing I wanna point out . Is this this national guttering around the roof ? So what ? It's raining that could get filled it with water . Then you're leaning in . All of a sudden , it just drips down your neck on . That makes you mad .Speaking about stuff which might get on your nerves about the G class . Here's five other annoying things .Normally , when you're reversing , sensors start to flatline like that . He's still got about a foot leeway , but it seems that Mercedes-Benz recalibrated the ones for this car to account for the spare wheel on the butt because , as you can see , it's pushed right into the prickly bushes .When the central locking engages , it sounds a little bit like a gun going off , which could prove a bit dangerous when you consider that some of the people who might buy this car probably also carry guns . And he might startle them .These running boards a Hyundai , we're getting into the car , but when you get out , you end up robbing the backs of your trousers on them on different the rear of the car . The side mounted exhausts as well , and then you just yeah , you just filthy in this bag hair .You have some netting , which you can attach the inside of the car . Maybe keep your dog separate from the interior . The cover . As you can see , it's it's all of it seas to get tangled on . It's even harder to fit onto put away .So I think I'll leave that there for the Mercedes delivery driver Deal with thes doors is so heavy and hard to shut properly that your friends will never be able to do it . You have to say , Just give it a jolly good slam .Thankfully , this car has plenty of cool features to help make up for all . This is five .Like the old J cast , this one uses a ladder frame chassis , and it's a bit like this chocolate bar , where you have , like a tough lower section , which the whales and everything they're attached to the body is placed on top with the new girl . In this case , it also has a rigid axle rear suspension like the old car for better off road travel . Yet the front gets modern double wishbone suspension . Improve comfort .You also have a modern , reckon pinion steering system . Where's Elka Hudson recirculating ball type , which is just really , really bad on dear . All these improvements means it off road , but also look better on road .The bonnet , wings , doors and tower gate are all made out of aluminium to help keep the weight down there . This thing still does weigh over 2.5 tons , as well as a low range mode for the gearbox .You've also got a front central Andrea differential for superior off road grip .This'd be class has ground clearance of 25 centimeters awaiting death of 70 centimeters on approaching departure angle of over 30 degrees .Things J 63 has a hand built twin turbo four litre V8 with 585 horsepower , 850 new two meters of torque , and you get 0 to 60 in just 4.5 seconds . Sounds pretty cold as well .Performance from this big thing is incredible . I tied it from 0 to 60 miles . Now in just 4.3 seconds . That's quicker than a Range Rover sport S V R floor . The throttle on this thing .It's like a dragster on stilts . The bonnet rises almost like a powerboat , and then it just Booker's off down the road like a bull mastiff that's just spotted . A cat drags you along behind it by the leash , whether you like it or not . Thankfully , though , it does have the agility to cope with its performance , unlike the old G 63 which is a bit like piloting a jet powered jelly down the road because if you made a sudden import than it would throw complete , wobbly and get confusing , wouldn't know what to do . Where is this one doesn't .So if you need to break to avoid hitting something , it will stop . If you need to steer around an obstacle , it will respond and change direction . The steering just works like that in a normal car , and it feels like it rather than just being something to hold on to . Of course , it's going to equality quickly . This thing will start to run wide , but considering weighs about as much as a fully grown white male rhinoceros , it handles pretty well . Now you can put into different modes with a Dr Select button and put into sports . If you want to in that wall do things like sharpen the throttle response . It'll make the engine sound a little bit more angry . It will also sharpen the shifts for the X and nice speed automatic gearbox , but it also stiffens up the suspension . That's not great , because already the car feels pretty firm , so obviously because it's a big , tall , heavy vehicle , they had to fit it with some stiff springs to stop it , leaning in the bends like a drunk at a bar . The problem with that is that whenever you go over a bump , any bump you feel it . It comes through to the cabin . I wouldn't say it was harsh , but the car is constantly fidgeting about been need . It's almost like you're sat on a washing machine on spin cycle . It does get better when you go on the most weight sort calms down , and it's actually all right to travel the military .This thing for some of that is about as aerodynamic as Buckingham Palace . You don't really get much wind noise . That's probably because you got double glazing . Thing is , though , I've just been on the motorway for two hours on cruising at a steady speed on by men returning 18 miles to the gallon . Not great , but I suppose if you can afford this guy , you don't really care , do you ?What you will care about is the fact that you do get a standard automatic cruise control so you can keep your safe distance from the car in front so you can just sit back and relax and enjoy the view from your lofty driving position .The rays driving position is particularly good when you're driving in time because you can even look down on people in rain drivers . Yes , they're making their king of the road . But in the G class , you are the emperor of the road and visit . It is good all round . So you got this shallow dash , and that , combined with the upright windscreen , means that you get a great view forward . And it helps that you can actually use the little indicators on the wings as sites . And then there's the wheel arches . They mean that you can actually see where the alloys Artie , don't curb them when you're trying to park on this big glass area , even the backing a huge rear window , it's partly obscured by that spare wheel , but it's not too bad .Then you've got some safety kit as well . So this car's auto emergency braking to prevent an accident the one in this cause seems to keep on seeing accidents that on actually about to happen . It keeps pre tensioning the seatbelt .Another slight problem , I guess , is the fact that you're turning circle in this thing isn't great , but you can always just drive over obstacles .Why should you want to ? You can actually take this car off road . I mean , it's a really capable off Rhoda . You can climb up hell's crawl over rocks and blasted over sand dunes . Or , like may just go for a leisurely drive through the woods .You know where this is gonna take me . Actually , I wouldn't get stranded . Not because of Carl . Conch over the terrain will do easily . It's more the fact that I might run out of fuel driving through Middle Earth this now for more information and to see how much money you can save on this car .Click on the pop out , but in the top right hand corner the screen to get a car way . So then , what's your verdict on the new G class ? Well , it's completely different to my normal verdicts . You see from most people , I would say , Avoid it because they're all better . Pretty messy V's out there , However , if you like it and you want one , just go right ahead on by it , because it's got so much character on really why it looks as cool as the old G wagon . It's just way , way easier to live with .

91,113,CLA 45 AMG,"It's pretty interesting car the new Mercedes C L . A . Because underneath this swooping junior C . L s looks , it's actually an A class on this one is identical beneath escape to the new pocket rocket a 45 mg because we drove this recently and basically had on my friend beneath the bonnet .There you have exactly the same 355 BHP four cylinder engine that you get in the 45 .Exactly the same seven speed double clutch gearbox . Exactly the same for Matic .A4 will drive system and , in theory , exactly saying his theory and shattered on breaks , etcetera .So it should , you would think , Dr Pretty much identical to the 45 give or take about 30 .Let's see .So there are three different dr programs to the gay books Comfort Sport on manual . I personally prefer in manual , so I'm going to put it in manual , and the gearbox is very good .It doesn't quite , do you what you wanted to do on downshifts , but we'll forgive it that because on up shifts and most of the rest of time , it's fantastic anything . I have a slight problem at the moment with the L A 45 is that it doesn't for some reason , same sick is the A 45 . I don't know why that is . I cannot believe that the addition of about 30 kilograms no more has taken this much ej off the driving experience .But it seems to I mean being no doubt this is still Mercedes-Benz identical A4 for the CNN A3 G5 not 64.6 limited top speed 155 on somewhere around somewhere between 10 and 11 .So seriously falls . But I don't know . It just doesn't quite have the have the mania of the 45 right at the top of the REV range .I don't think of these new Baby Benz AMG ease as filling removed because they know they're actually pretty refined . Okay , there's a bit of buzz from the four cylinder engine , but the suspension and the steering , everything it does on the movie is pretty well resolved .I do like the steering of the new C L . A 45 . It's got no electronic governs in it , and there's no variable ratio rack or anything like that . It's just a nice , honest standard . Power assisted steering set up , and it's really you could but huge faith from Time Warner . And there's just there's a nice amount of field that comes back through the rim to which is unusual . The brakes are also everything that you want them to be from a car like this .I'm not sure I really go for the engine noise . It's You can't argument the maths here . You've got �355.161 grams of carbon being chucked out at full 0.6 to 60 and 40 old mpg . You just can't argue with that . But one sacrifice that you make you get is base .I mean , I like the little fasting makes when you upshift . That's great , but it's still a four cylinder engine . At the end of the day on all the walls .It doesn't sound like A6 does it . It never will .It does lots of things really well , with 45 perceiving it looks great .The cabin is lovely to be in , and it's roomier than you think .You cannot not performance , even if you can't have a little little bit . Neagle aboutthe boots .Big staring is , um , yeah , to drive to Bay City .I'm sure to live with every day this really , really lovely . But here's the thing .�41,000 for that , these crackers . But having said that , this car is almost almost good enough to justify a mad price like that ."
92,114,C Class,"at long last Mercedes-Benz direct rival for the very successful BMW three . Siri's Coop A . With this , the new C class you pay . We've already looked at the M3 rival , the C 63 . Today we're looking at the slightly more sensible see 2 50 CD .I lieutenant . This particular flavor of C Class coupe A8 makes most sense is on medium speed Cruiser . It's very refined in here , and you got plenty of low down talk with diesel engine .You go , the quicker the shattered and cope with it , and the steering is very accurate .But the engine can get a little grub practicality .There's always gonna be a compromise with a coupe . A roof line on the C class here is that the rear headroom is a little bit restricted , but if you can live with that , the rest of the car is very accommodating .Value from you pay a pretty move 1600 quid for a C Class Cooper over Equivalent Saloon .However , this does undercut the BMW 3 to 5 deep on dhe . It's also clean up .It may have taken Mercedes awhile to deliver the C Class coupe , but it's been worth the wait because What we have here is a very practical and to my eyes , elegantly styled Coop , eh ? That's also a pleasant drive and competitively priced . The 92nd verdict is four stars ."
93,115,E 63 AMG ,"Mercedes-Benz slaughtered at 6.2 liter V eight engine into the e class of state and given us this the E 63 AMG estate . Now we know we already love the 518 brake horsepower saloon . So is the estate of good entertainment .The 63 definitely doesn't disappoint on that count . It really is so much fun . V8 . It's just fantastic . Deliveries . Excellent steering is perfectly weighted , and it's also got that combination of usability practicality .And Larry knows that this kind of practicality Thesixty three's got the biggest boot in the class .695 liters . With the seats up , there's loads of rare space for passengers really good front cabin , which has taken straight from the saloon anyway .Quality is excellent . Driving position's really good . There's very few complaints , really pretty much value for money .�74,400 for the 63 state and nice , not cheap by any standards . And also the running costs are going to be enormous , but it is in a class of its own . It's difficult to justify , but even so , you're not left feeling short changed .Some people might question why you need a 518 brake horsepower V8 estate . Frankly , if you're an enthusiast , you don't need justification . The E 63 is a truly exceptional machine . We love it , and we just got its around . It's a bit pricey , so the 92nd verdict for 1/2 stars ."
94,116,SLS AMG,"Mercedes-Benz has a new supercar . It's called the S L s A M G , and 100 and �60,000 off their about its price directly to compete with the likes of Ferrari , Porsche and Aston Martin . But there's one thing those cars don't have that this car does .Gullwing Mercedes is back .Entertainment was 6.2 liter engine in the front that makes a V8 rumble to match anything that comes out Detroit with 563 horsepower . It will be entertaining . Handling isn't rubbish .It's agile . It's poised , quite stiff on the road on the way .Practicality , A bit of a mixed bag , really Mercedes-Benz saw how people are gonna use this card . There's now have a decent stereo , but these doors call .There they are .They're a pain to get in and out off that makes can't very wide , and you think God really reach to get the door down . But when it is down , head was pretty tight as well .For money . Welcome Any car �160,000 . We considered good value , possibly not , but against its peers it is competitively priced . But look at it this way . Your Mercedes-Benz sell our was slower didn't handle as well . It was �200,000 more expensive .So it's a loud , raucous experience dominated by this enormous engine but all wrapped up into a usable Mercedes-Benz package . The 92nd verdict is four stars ."
95,117,AMG GT 63 S,"This is the new Mercedes AMG GT four door , and it's effectively Mercedes answer to the Porsche Panamera turbo . So in this video , and they take you for a walk around the design and shame inside it , obviously take it for a test drive on dhe for a spin on the track before door that make sure you subscribe to this channel and click the Bell icon to Tony notifications onto alerted .When we make a new upload while you're looking at here , folks is the most powerful engine you concurrently get from Mercedes-Benz . This four litre twin turbo V8 has 639 horsepower and 900 Newton meters of talk . In this GTS model , you can get a slightly less powerful GT-R version with 585 horsepower 800 new two meters . But then you don't have the bragging rights .Despite the name , the AMG GT four door isn't actually anything to do with the normal AMG GT coupe .So instead of being rear wheel drive , it uses the all wheel drive system from the E 63 s , which is handy considering the performance on top , which all demonstrate now , seeing as this is Mercedes . Most powerful car you can buy . It makes sense to do standing quarter mile run in it . And I'm gonna use the cost Special data logging equipment . So I've got in it . Sport your settings . Left foot on the brake floor The throttle . Build the revs Up with my puddle . Don't go !Come on ! This is going fast . What's it gonna d'oh on ? That is the standing quarter . We did it in 12.24 seconds .I was actually expecting it to go a little bit quicker as I've timed it . E 63 S8 11.2 seconds . So we give the GT-R chance .That's quick . Oh , here we go . Not a super fast . Whoa on , guys . Enough of that . So , what did we get ? Standing quarter mile in 11.97 seconds ?That's not too bad , considering the GT weighs 200 kilos more than the 63 . But then it is a little bit more special than a pump to be class . This is a unique AMG car . You will not be able to get a normal Mercedes-Benz on it very much .Looks like an AMG , doesn't it ? You got em . G's latest Grill there , and it just seems bigger and more aggressive than on its other models . It's huge . There's also a huge Aaron takes to feed air into that four liter V eight engine . They're the ones down here can actually shut off when the engine doesn't need cooling toe aid . Aerodynamics . I'm even down the side . You've got some led headlights . They're they're very , very sleek . And actually , you look at the car from certain angles . It kind of reminds me of a shark . A tiger shop , no less . I'm gonna be specific about my sharks .So down the sides you got 21 inch alloy wheels and huge breaks . These are the standard brakes , and he got six piston calipers for plenty of stopping power .One thing I'm not sucking on those this Look , what's inside is doing here this fake vent . It's unnecessary because this is an otherwise stylish looking car , and it doesn't think that Mercedes do lately where there's no increases , it's all just smooth . It's almost like a pebble that you find on a beach has been washed smooth bythe sea over thousands of years . This car is actually based loosely on the E class But it's wider , it's longer , it's lower and it's more aggressive . That's why they're giving it some side skirts . They're making it look . It's hugging the ground at the back here , you have got some wide haunches making muscular . You got sloping roof line to make it look like a Cupid . But look , of course it has four doors . Hence the name , but they're frameless door , so it's very cool . You know , it's coop A8 like , isn't it ? Moving down the back . You got thin led tail lights and he got what looks like fake Evans there . But actually , there's a little holes in there and some holes in here they do serve a purpose . Letting the air flow of the rear will on exit here today , what's also not fake . If you look down here , you've got really exhaust pipes .I mean , they're actually exhaust tips because the pipe is in there . But at least it's not fate . Like almost Mercedes .On a standard , you get a performance exhaust , so plenty of noise .The source . A little rear diffuser down here is where once again , to smooth the airflow . But this is a big thing for me on this car is the fact that it's a hatchback . So , yeah , hatchback like a Porsche Panamera .Which one do you think that's the best ? The Porsche Panamera Turbo ? Or this click on the pop out back in the top , right hand corner of the screen to cast a vote ?The mgt . Four door will cost from �121,000 for the normal GT-R on �135,000 for the higher powered s version . But does it feel suitable ? Expensive Inside ?You might look at this interior and think it's pretty much the same as any 60 three's , but actually there are some very key differences . So these vents , they're like this turbine effect , which looked cool . But the biggest difference is down here . This center console , which is absolutely massive and it's actually been designed to mimic V8 engine because you've got these little banks .There's four on each side of switches where you control different things , such as the volume , the stops , our system , the deployable wing at the back of the exhaust , the traction control , the suspension , the gearbox settings and obviously your driver's modes as well . You've also got the little aim gear selected down here and in front of it is the new Mercedes mouse powder for the entertainment system .So it's touch sensitive and it has haptic feedback . So when you go across different icons , it vibrates to let you know you're clicking the right thing .That in front of it , this one's got some carbon fiber effects here , which covers yeah , the cup holders Very important .Those are then various toggle switches there for the ventilation system on this car's got Alcantara the Interior , which makes it feel sporty , as do these wonderful sport seats .Then obviously , you got the infotainment system itself with two huge screens . You can control this main screen using this control pad here , or the pad on the steering wheel on this driver's information display using the left pad , and you can go through different menus and stuff . And generally I really like this entertainment system .I think it's pretty easy to use terms of storage . It's actually all right in here . No decent practicality , the glove boxes and all right size on the door bins of Bigas . Well , that bottle , the A easy copes with that and the light of felt as well so things don't rattle around when you're zooming through the corners .The GT four door is also good for carrying larger items , too . In case you're wondering , you could fit 395 liters in this car's boot . One thing I should point out , though , that is quite a big load lip to lift stuff over . Be careful with your back when you're loading it threesome or storage space just under here as well . If you needed an extra 66 liters and if I fold the rear seats down , which I can do electrically by pressing these buttons , you then have a flat load area with 1324 liters of space . Yes , and I'm being very precise . But this is a German car , and the Germans demand that you are precise also in the interests of precision .I ask someone to show for me so I could see what it's really like to travel in the back of this four door coupe A8 . So is it salubrious enough ? Well , despite that sloping roof light , it's actually quite spacious . Look , loads and loads of room . I can't complain about that . Also , quite the fact that you've got these contoured seats in the back so they feel sport if you don't feel like you're part of the action , even if you're relegated to the rear . What's not so great , though , is that it does feel a bit dark Black into is no helping on DDE . Neither is the small rear window . So maybe I'll put this light on . It will help . So what ? Well , maybe not , but it doesn't do anything guzzle , I suppose . The seatbelt to do brighten things up a bit , but that's about it . No problem I have is the fact that this sea A8 SportsCenter from the front . But they block your view for you in the back . And if you're someone like May , he gets a bit carsick . It's not great specially when this thing can accelerate really hard . So I get a bit , Yeah , you might need carry one of these if it bit queasy , and that brings you into what's not great about this AMG .Well , in addition to that unimaginative four door name , a lot of people see this car and go , Oh , look , you've got a Mercedes C less nice , and you'll forever be having to say No , it's not . It's an AMG GT four door . It's completely different , way more expensive and faster . Yeah , you're seeing gets sick of having to constantly explain yourself .There's no separate guide nor runners for the rear seat belt . So when you fold the back seats down , sometimes snag , which could get real nerves .Look at this nasty chief that plastic down . It's absolutely awful .It's outrageous to have it in a car , which cost well over �100 pounds because the door opening is actually much lower than the roof line .A lot of people make the mistake of not ducking when they go to get out .How if you're static , you can't rev the engine past 4000 rpm . We should really annoying if you're sad , the traffic lights and you want to impress other motorists with how called your car's exhaust sounds .Thankfully , this car has plenty of core features , which helps make up for all this .Here's five . The AMG GT four door gets rear wheel steering , our standard at lower speeds . The back wheels turn in the opposite direction to the front wheels been like on a forklift truck . Tow aid , low speed maneuverability . But then when you get the highest speed , they turned in the same direction as the front wheels for improved high speed stability .The car has an active rear spoiler , which can raise to four different positions , depending on how fast you going . Or you can raise it fully up when you're just cruising around by pressing a button in the cabin .If you think that looks cool , get the car with dynamic engine mounts . Somebody just cruising along the horse and you're gonna loosely see Don't get too many vibrations entering the cabin . But when you gain fascists and corners and holds it tightly to prove the handling , if you have the GTS model , it comes out standard with an active rear differential and that consent power to which rear wheel has the most grip For optimal corner exiting traction , you get the new AMG Sport steering wheel that has special toggles here for various functions like the gearbox , the suspension settings on the various driving modes .Also , you can turn the car from four wheel drive to RIA will drive by selecting drift mode , though this is not recommended for road use . Speaking of which was the GT four door like to drive ? Well , Yeah , it feels like a proper , full fat badass . AMG . You know , I've got it on . It's comfy . It's setting by Comptel that there's a beast lurking beneath causal after days . Put my foot down . Yeah , just takes off . This thing has got so much pulling power . That gearbox . You got nine speeds . Nine speeds For it to think about , you could just find the right gear instantly . I've got to be careful because I'm in America on on this road , speeding is just 65 miles an hour on dhe .You exceeded like that . So the air suspension , which you get a standard even in comfort mode , it never feels floaty . It always feels tied down . Do you feel your bumps here and there ? But it's never too bad staring . It's sharp . It's precise . I love the fact that you got his Alcantar covering . It just makes the car feel sporty , just cruising along . If you feel that the engine just kind of worrying away even with the exhaust in the quiet of setting , you could do Mar after mile in this thing . Then he can twiddle some knobs and make it a little bit more aggressive song attorneys doll put into sports mode . In fact , why not go to sports ? Plus adds weight to the steering . Sharper Z4 response makes the gearbox more responsive as well , and it's put me into the stiffest of three settings on the suspension . But I don't want that because it's a little bit too stiff for the road , so I'm gonna knock it back into the middle setting , which is fine for fast rate driving .I like the fact that I can mix and match all the different settings , so you put the exhausting it's loudest setting . I'm gonna put the gearbox into manual mode . I'm gonna change gears myself because that will let me play a bit more with the exhaust . This is silly , but it's so much fun . And that's what Angie is all about . Their raucous . They're bad , they're crazy . They make you feel alive on this card . Definitely makes you feel alive , however , will it kill you ? Should you dare to take it on the circuit ? So this is a very technical track .It's quite hard to learn to be able to confidently drive around it in a car that weighs 2.1 tons .Well , has a lot to say for how well this thing is set up . It's really predictable , really well balanced for world drive system is great for holding you out of tight turns give you plenty of grip , but even if you have it in a wheel drive mode is just so much just get it sliding . You've got this kind of intermedia stability control offsetting on it lets you have a little bit of slip without you getting into any trouble . Those big breaks do a good job as well . If you're doing a lot of circuit work , you're probably going to want the optional carbon ceramics . I'll tell you what . This is a proper proper thing . You no good on the road capable for a massive car on the track . This is a machine that could be all things to all men and all women so long .Yes , you can afford it .Enjoy this video , please like it , comment on it and share it .

96,118,AMG A 35 ,"here we have the brand new Mercedes , A 35 a . M g . And essentially , this is Mercedes . Answer to the Volkswagen Golf are . So it's a posh hot hatchback , which you can live with every day until suitably proud off . Now , in this video , I don't see how it lives up to that by see what it's like to drive .Whoa !It really does go on a test sites performance North S60 in 4.7 seconds , according to Mercedes . But I'm gonna see for myself .I'm also going to take a look around the cabin , see what's changed over the normal . A class actually doesn't look all that super to me .And , of course , find out what's good about it on what's not so good about it .Okay , let's start this review by talking about the design . So there's been some styling upgrades over the normal Take us . The most noticeable is the A M G . Grilled . You've also got front splitter as well on some events here . Which do you actually do something local ? Prove it with the coma stick of truth , they lead over there and help tell air over the wills Protease drug .You have to get led headlights a standard . These are actually the upgraded matrix ladies , which can kind of move that beam about dazzle of the drivers down the side of the car that some side skirts .There are some more friends here at the back with these fake look , no ill fate . They don't go anywhere . However , you do get a rear diffuser , and that does actually do something on dhe twin sports exhausts .And it's a great exhaust of the normal car , which sounds better now .This particular car has the AMG styling package on it . So include some of the stuff , such as you got blacked out rear windows as well on this grated 19 inch Allah wills with black paint , and they looked super cool , but most noticeable . Is this the roof spoiler ? Now what do you think about that ? You don't have tohave it right ? You can have the car without it , and it looks kind of a bit more stealth . I actually really like I think it adds to the purpose will look of this couple . What do you think on the pop out banning the top right corner of the screen to vote ? Would you have this car with a spoiler without the spoiler . Inside , there is a minor sporty upgrades . The most noticeable , though , is the MG Sports Steering Wheel , which does feel lovely . Also , you've got actual metallic gear shifter pedals started .This car gets an automatic gearbox . Also , you have some AMG specific displays so you can show things such as vehicles doing what the engines doing and various other things about performance on with a dynamic select . You have a sport plus mode for added sporting us as well . Yea , another thing you can do is change the dolls on this car , and unlike within normal acres , you get an extra one super sport , which actually doesn't look all that soup . It's in a oh , forgot .You also get some aluminium pedals on . If you look down there down there , look AMG sill plates . All right , then .Other than that , it's a class businesses usual , which means a high quality interior andan excellent entertainment system , which you can control with real world voice commands us to get decent space in the back seat on a reasonable boots .But that's not why you're watching this video . You want to know how quick this bad boy is ? Well , let me demonstrate . This guy uses an upgraded version of the two litre , four cylinder turbo charged petrol engine from the 80 50 so it now has 306 horsepower and 400 new two meters . Now it should be out to get from 0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds , according to Mercedes . But I'm gonna see for myself some time . It with my figuring gear appear to put the car into sports plus mode . Put the traction into handling mode , which I mean Dr Just floor the break for the throne . Start engaged . Let's do this .It's good gear change , not 60 easy peasy Mercedes .It wasn't like music . And that's the thing with the whole voice activation system . If you're a journalist and you constantly saying Mercedes , how can I help you ? She constantly interrupted when you're trying to deliver to camera .So I was saying it did Naught to 60 bang on 4.7 seconds , just like Mercedes suggest .Could you repeat your input , please ? Turned up the stereo .What would you like to do ?You have a bloody understands me on that brings you on to five annoying things about the A 35 .These chunky sport seats do eat into the rear passenger space a bit more than the normal seeds . Also , the huge head rest means that blocks your view . The road ahead . Plus , if you got young , annoying children , they main Jiaping you in the back of the net .His home there's a grated 19 into our wills may look super cool The way the rim on the spokes it proud to the tire means you're soon gonna curb .The sport is steering Rod is pretty cool . The only problem is that it blocks some of the information from the screen and you paid extra for the screen and some of that detail there you're gonna want to see , which means you actually have to kind of look around it when you're driving , which isn't exactly ideal .The full fat , proper M3 cars have the guest like it down here , whereas this one has a steering column just like a normal a class . If used to em , G5 took in this get into gear for about half an hour . That's why I did it . Yeah , maybe it's because I'm stupid .Starting list price of this car is �36,000 which is quite expensive . And then , once you've added some options yet soon mounts up , for instance , this car here it's a list price of options is over �44,000 . And for that you can get a terraced house in whole , though that doesn't mean you have to live in a hole . That's why it's really with what I got into a car . Why ? Because you can save an average of almost �3000 . Offer new A 35 . So if you want to call and check out the price , just click of the pop out banging . It's a blank on the screen from the league below the video . Just Google Car away and see the best price that you could get in this car . Any yuko .However , it's not all bad . There's plenty of cold mechanical upgrades over the normal a class to help make up for all this .The steering has been upgraded over the normal A8 class , and it has its own sport ratio .Plus , it's solid bond into the body to make it and your job , a solid plate is bolted to the bottom of the engine to keep the suspension mounts more stiffly mounted .The car's suspension has been completely overhauled . Say get aerated springs dampers . Anti roll bars . Also the front wishbones don't have bushings there solid mounted to the body while they're suffering at the back . Same again , no bushings . Solid management of the body . So it just makes it stiffer . Maura . Aggressive .Get bigger . Break this and they're clamped by modern block four piston calipers . Actually , these are the same calipers and get on the old A 45 a . M . J .The car has a predictive or we'll drive system , so no , no one is just driving along . Its in front wheel drive motor helps a fuel , but then , depending on your steering angle , your throttle import your speed on the road conditions . It can predict when the front wheel is going to stop the destruction on before they even do you consent upto 50% of the power to the back .However dual these upgrades have a big impact on the way the A 35 fails to drive . The first thing to talk about is the suspension , because it'll , Steph are , but has that made it uncomfortable ? Car to live it every day ? Well , thankfully , no . Yes , you do feel the bumps more than in the normal a class , but it's not too bad . It'll not too bad . And as you go faster , it seems that line the mount better . And if he really does bother you , the stiffer suspension you can get an adaptive set up with a softer mode . If you want that .Perhaps the only problem with this car compared to the Norway class is that he's seen to just get more noise in the tires . Which can they've ever drag on you like cruising on the motorway ?Sometimes the engine isn't the most responsive . Just say you're cruising along in comfort mode . You want to suddenly just zip through a gap in traffic floor . It A3 pauses like this . Kind of like a hole where the turbo hasn't spooled up and the gearbox hasn't properly chosen the gear that you just left floundering for a split second . But when you are in the right gear on and it's ready to go , this thing really can shift so put into manual mode , and then he can control the seven speed gear box yourself and it is noticeably more lively . Shop with throttle response .You get quicker changes from that gearbox , but wait to the staring and the exhaust becomes more noisy now It's not . The noises exhorts when you floor it .It does sound a little bit like a washing machine but Mercedes and engineered in some sounds . So when you change up again , they did this thing with the fuel in , which makes a barb sound bombs . And you go quite so that when you change down , really have to have this engine spinning over 3000 rpm to get maximum performance out of it . Something like a Volkswagen Golf R pulls hard from low down , which in some ways is good . But that doesn't encourage you to chase the red line as much as the way this engine is set up . Doesn't really do just wanna rain . This car's a little bit .Whoa , I didn't really just go out here on a twisty road . This is quite capable machine . It really does grip quite well . You point the car exactly where you want it with his very direct staring . What it doesn't have those is that ability to change direction when let's say you're really wide , but he left off . When you want to tighten your life , really do . They just kind of carries on is not the most adjustable Hotch . Let's play follow something like a Honda Civic type R or even a goal . Far , I think this is the kind of hotch that is better for everyday use . And when you want to , you give it a squirt rather than the kind of car that you got specifically for a drive for the weekend .So then what's my final verdict ?Well , first of all , I have to say I absolutely love the looks of this thing , and it's easy to live with as a daily driver .Plus , you get it packed full of Mercedes-Benz technology , and if you do that , it is the most high tech hot hatch you concurrently . By now , there are the hot hatches that are a little bit more fun to drive this thing . It has . Pace has poised on . It has presence . The only real problem is that it comes at quite a price .

You think by the minute I've been tricked here now you can make it a little bit better . The suspension , by going for the optional dampers around 500 quid and they didn't make the car ride better on they may get handled better as well , but still not as good as its rivals . It just doesn't feel a lot much like just say it is .

That's for engines . Well , the petrels here , they're only okay . Details are better , but the 1.5 days old he's a bit slow to 0.1 liters are much more powerful .

And so the 30 30 i sedan will start a $40,250 if you wanted to opt for the all wheel drive version a k a X drive , that is gonna add 2000 bumping it up to $42,250 .Regardless , power plant is going to be the same on the 2019 3 30 I powering . This one is going to come from a two litre , twin power turbocharged inline four cylinder engine , putting out 255 horsepower 5000 rpm , �295 feet of torque available around 1500 rpm . Power is gonna be sent to the rear wheels through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which you guys know . As always , we will be testing out a little bit here . But 0 to 60 time BMW claims is gonna commit in approximately 5.6 seconds . If you go with the rear wheel drive , at least all wheel drive is gonna put you at 5.3 seconds and mpg . Numbers come in a 26 city 36 highway for the rear wheel drive 25 city 34 highway for the all wheel drive .But so before we get into any accelerations on this one , it would have mentioned there are some drive modes located just left of the shifter there at what they're going to do is adjust the throttle response , the shift points , the steering sensitivity and the gauge set up a swell . So gauges are gonna change slightly as well . I thought that was pretty cool , but either way , I think you guys know what we have to do next year . Let's put the shifter all the way to the back into the left . That is gonna give me that manual shift mid where you have full control over the paddle shifters and let's do that paddle shift Your test Your see how quickly they react for us .Yeah , paddle shifters . Always crazy . Quick . BMW is absolutely love them . Definitely no issues with any delayed reaction times .But let me put it back into that normal Dr Mode here . Let's do a quick little acceleration on these back roads . See how quickly we can get the new 2019 3 30 I said , Dan here , ex drive in sport mode here of the speed with To say that this thing is quick is an understatement . That 3 30 i sedan is fast doesn't even have to be in and A3 this thing is pretty darn quick . Definitely no issues of merging onto the highway . And you gotta love the X drive is well being that it is around 30 degrees out right now Here , p A . The X drive is gonna give you that traction needed to put the power to the ground , unlike perhaps a rear wheel drive version which you may get a little bit of spinning with . But that ex dr definitely put the power to the ground . Absolutely love it .. But so then to go along with that acceleration , braking is equally important . And so , as you would expect , there are four wheel ventilated disc brakes standard . And as far as the breaking field goes , I have had absolutely zero issues when it comes to that no brake pedal delay or anything like that . But now let's touch on handling and suspension because there have been a lot of changes . Actually , for the 2019 3 30 I , including an all new G20 chassis , a K and all new platforms that is definitely pretty exciting .It's gonna be longer . It's gonna be wider , and it's actually roughly the size oven old 2003 A5 Siri's So all in all , the three Siri's has grown in size , still on the smaller side .But the fact that it now has a longer and wider wheelbase is gonna improve handling as well . But so along with that , you will get a double pivot type front suspension with an anti roll bar and stiffer springs in the back of Bible in rear suspension , along with rear damper technology and twin tube gas pressurised shock absorbers . As far as the ride quality goes , I have had absolutely zero issues in this one , rides like a BMW Therefore , it is super smooth , and as far as the steering wheel goes , it is nice . It is , as expected , not as heavy as an M3 or anything like that . But if it's the 3 30 I , well and I will also mention because BMW has a tendency to put thicker grips on the steering wheel . A3 30 I is not as thick of some of the others that I test driven . Even the X5 has thicker groups than this one .When it comes to cabin noise . A3 Siri's is insanely quiet , definitely no issues with that . It really is one of the quieter cars I've driven in a while .And when it comes to visibility , the three Siri's has never had any issues there . I could see perfectly fine out back . One additional thing when it comes to visibility I want to mention is there is a head up display available for the three syriza's Well , so that is gonna be there for you if you go with premium package . Better helping you keep your eyes on the road .That is always nice , but enough with the driving dynamics . You guys , I think it is time . Let's check out the exterior of this all new 2019 BMW 3 30 i sedan . It's so to start , there is a slightly revised for an end to the new BMW three Siri's different headlight design .And by the way , led headlights do come . Standard cornering lights are going to be available . And actually , BMW laser light headlights is what you were looking at right now . And that's basically going to give you the max output of light allowed by U . S .Law That's gonna come with the executive pack neckers for around $2600 . So this is going to be the very best illumination out there on the road right now .In the center there , there is a revised front grill , and you probably already noticed the revised from bumper near the bottom . There is a black finish rather than the body colored finished in the previous three Siri's . But then make your way to the side Power folding key did sign . Mears will come standard along with led integrated turd signals within them as well , and there will be chrome window surrounds if you go with the sport line or luxury package is the M sport package . However , is going to give you black windows surrounds .Take a look down at the wheel set of standards set up . It's gonna come sized up 18 by 7.5 inches and they're gonna come with run flat tires as well . However , the M Sport package is gonna bump that up to 19 inch staggered alloy wheels . And they are going to come with Michelin pilot sport for a summer tires .Make your way to the back . You will find the revised daylight designed for 2019 . Kind of looks similar to a Lexus GS , maybe , in my opinion , but it looks good nonetheless . Led tail lights will come standard and just below all of that dual exhaust outlets with chrome tips .So you guys know we have to do next . As always , here is that exhaust clip .It's open else , since we all around back to open that rear hatch , there actually is a button on the key fob . That is simply what I'm going to use their , and to close that rear hatch , there is a button on the actual hatch to simply press that walk away if you like , because it is a power trunk release . But nonetheless , once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna come in . It's 17 cubic feet . What I found interesting here is for comparison sake . 2018 BMW , 3 35 I actually came in at 13 cubic feet , so that is a good bit more space , comparing the two model years there . But nonetheless , if you needed some more space , there is a 40 2040 split , meaning there's receipts . Do full down for a good bit of extra space there if you needed it , make your way to the rear leg room .It comes in at 35.2 inches , so it's a little bit tight from my six foot self , but still comfortable nonetheless .Also for those rear passengers , there is a rear armrest with cupholders along with rear air vents , so they stay comfortable and there is Tri Zone climate control as well available .And that is why you see that temperature indicator below that rear air vent there because the passengers consent their own temperatures there and there are rear heated seats available depending on the package that you go with but make your way to the front seats , they will come standard 14 way power adjustable front seats . They will come with memory settings . Standard finished . All the seating is gonna be a sense . Attack upholstery . However , there is a leather finish available if you wanted it . And by the way , this front seats will come heated and ventilated and taking a look at the steering wheel up front .There it is , a tilt and telescoping steering wheel . It does come . Leather wrapped heated steering wheel is available . I do happen . Have it today . So that's definitely been nice .But as far as the start up , guys , let me start by showing you guys the key here . You do have your lock unlock up on the pop of rear hatch . And as I always like to mention , the lock button is actually the BMW loco in the middle there .But to start this one up there is a push button start just to the left of the shifter . They're so simply put your foot on the brake and press that engine start button there . And what started up ? One of the best parts about all the new 2019 BMW Z8 Seems that air coming out right now there is a full digital display front and center . So , essentially , what you have is your speedometer on your left , along with a digital speedometer within that tachometer is gonna be on your right . The center is gonna be used for navigation and on the left side , There you have how many miles you have left until you empty along with the outside temperature . Overall , a very high end , very techie digital gauge set up up there , and I absolutely love it personally .But now let's take a look at overall interior quality on this one because there is an answer site headliner that comes standard along with oak wood Finishes absolutely love that universal garage door opener for up to three different garage doors . Also standard and be lighting again .Standard three zone climate control already mentioned that power moonroof also up top .They're also standard , so it does have a very high end finish , as expected , with BMW and in this personal three Siri's I gotta love the two tone leather combination . The saddle brown leather is definitely where it's at , but now let's take a look at the tech display .8.8 inch color touchscreen display will come standard , and it's actually three ways in control . What's on that display ? It is touch screen . There is a circular dial with some buttons just to the right of the shifter there , and it is boys controlled as well , if you wanted to . But nonetheless , Bluetooth , an audio streaming will come standard along with an apple carplay one year trial that's gonna be with the premium package . Factory navigation system will also come state , and you can also check out your weather updates as well . If you wanted Thio And , of course , like any other vehicle , you have your radio settings .And when it comes to the sound system on this one , a hi fi sound system with 10 speakers will come standard that also includes 205 watts .Let's turn on the radio here . We got playing this morning and less to stop the clarity .This one , definitely a very nice sound system on this one .Then the last thing on the tech display wanted to mention to you guys is when you do put A3 , Siri's in reverse . You will find a rear view camera , letting you know who or what is behind you , which is always is going to lead me into safety . It's time to start . There are front , side and side curtain airbags . Also , we driver and passenger need airbags front there as well . In the back , you of latch take a lower anchors and tethers for children for the rear car seats also wanted to mention the executive package here .Now , this package goes for an additional $2100 .But that is gonna give you that BMW laser light illumination I was previously mentioning Also A3 D View Monitor , which you were looking out just a couple seconds ago .There Gesture control , which is my favorite part about this whole thing . You could turn the volume up and turn the volume down by simply just rotating your finger and clockwise and counterclockwise rotation . So definitely been having fun without the whole test drive . Honestly .But that package is also going to give you parking assistant plus , which is essentially where the car parallel parks itself . And there is a parking assistance package .If you wanted that by itself for an additional $900 .But last safety package in one dimension is the driving assistance package .That's just gonna add an additional 500 which is not all that bad , considering the grand scheme of things here .But blind spot warning with rear cross traffic alert . Also gonna include lane departure warning frontal collision warning with city collision mitigation and speed limit recognition technology .It's still been anyways , that is about it for this when you guys thank you so much for watching be shot . I like the video went , Subscribe different . Follow me on social media at the bottom of the screen there and I will see you guys in the next video Go ."
100,157,X1,"all right . Hey , everybody . My car was in for repairs earlier this week , and the dealer gave me a loader car . BMW X1 And I've never driven one before , eh ? So I thought it would be fun to do a little mini review of my thoughts on the car . So I want to talk about the exterior of the interior , just what the experience was like and whether or not I give it a thumbs up or not . Um so the X1 is BMW entry level SUV .It's their smallest SUV , and it starts in the $30,000 range about mid thirties . The one that I was in had literally almost every single option you can spec out . So it actually stickered at $47,000 which is a lot of money for a small SUV . It was very nice , but it's a lot of money to ask . So exterior .The first thing I want to point out is that mine was in an awesome blue color . It was part of the M sport package , which had a different front in and some blacked out window trim in different wheels on it looked sharp . I love the exterior of the X1 . I think that the designers did an awesome job , you know , it's just really sort of classically handsome . It's almost a simple design , and I think it'll age really well . Like a lot of BMW's . Just the exterior design was on point . It was fantastic a little bit about the interior . Um , the first thing I noticed when I got in the car is how fantastic the stitching is . There is blue stitching on everything here . It's on the seats . It's on the center console here . It's something Arm rest , conceit on the door there and there . It's on the back seats . The stitching is phenomenal . I love the stitching . I'm a big , big fan of stitching , so stitching everywhere . I know that saying stitching a lot , but I I'm really excited about it . That's my favorite thing about the inside . Beyond that , I was actually a little surprised to see that this one suspect with the wood trim , but I think it looks really great . Actually , it's really refined game . I think some of the other options are things like aluminum and aluminum is fine , but this definitely adds a level of sophistication that I really really dig . Um , Things take a little bit of Ah , down . Ah , downward spiral from there . I'm not a big fan of a couple of things . The first thing I wanna point out is that uses piano black trim , uh , for the for the aircon controls . And you also have a little bit of it down here with the parking brake and everything . And , you know , black is just one of those things where it's impossible to keep clean . You know , I picked this car up this morning , and it was obviously cleaned by the dealer before I got it . She could already see dust on other stuff . And fingerprints just show up . Really ? Well , I'm glad that they don't use it on a lot of the interior , but it is still disappointing that it's really on anything . Uh , the other thing I wanted to call it is the steering wheel . The steering wheel is covered in leather , and it feels pretty good to the touch . But I was a little disappointed that the stitching here is just black stitching . Um , especially since this is the M steering wheel that comes with the M sport package . The stitching on my car are proper in cars has the tri color BMW logo on the stitches . So I'm a little disappointed that they just used black for this . Um , that reminds me going back to the stitching . They even weave in the tri color for the inn logo on the seats , which is just super super cool .The seats themselves are pretty comfortable . The inside is actually really spacious .And you have this really great , uh , sun roof , uh , across which is pretty cool .I have people in the back seats earlier today and they said it was super comfortable , so I think the space is pretty good . But overall , I think you did a pretty good job .I'm not as in love with the interior as I am with the exterior . I think it looks just really awesome on the outside . Um , the rest of the interior is just I don't know . It's it's perfectly functional . I think the materials , they're super , super nice , but the but the design could maybe he's a little bit of an update . Some of this stuff is starting to look a little bit dated , but overall say a solid job . People will be happy with inferior again , especially if they love stitching . I wanted to make sure I got a shot or two of three interior in a bit of a darker place just because I think you did a really cool job with the ambient lighting in this car . Um , you can see along the door you have this really great , very sleek lighting . And it's also down , uh , the center on the driver's side , that this kind of stuff is just really cool . And I know a lot of cars have and being lighting today , my car included , but I think it's really just an easy way for automakers to make the interior . Their cars just feel a little bit more special . Um , and I also just really love the traditional amber lighting that BMW does on their non M cars . It's much more amber in real life than it is on the video here , but it's just one of those things where it's just a little bit different and just really cool now .One thing I did want to note that's actually a little bit ergonomically unpleasant about this car is the cup holder situation . You can even see . So this is more or less my eyesight . You can see how far away in the cup holders are this me extending my arm all the way ? I'm not a giant , but I'm also not a short person . The cup holders , for whatever reason , are super deep . This is me sitting full back and you can see that my hand rests , you know , on the gear lever , the way you would expect it to . I don't know why the cup holders , they're so far away .So before I talk about the driving experience , some of you have probably concluded that this is not the X1 that I'm sitting in . This is my car . The loner was not unexpected thing to have happened . So I actually didn't have any my video equipment with me that day . All I had was my phone . So , unfortunately , I don't have video of me actually driving it , but I can still talk about what I thought that experience was like and I'll start with what really works .The first thing is the engine . So the X1 comes with the same two litre turbo charged four cylinder That's in a lot of BMW thes days , produces somewhere around 230 horsepower somewhere around 260 foot pounds of torque . And for city driving , it was actually an excellent engine . The thing about turbocharged engines is you get so much Lohan torque that getting off the line like away from a stoplight or stop sign . It's just so effortless and so easy from that experience , it was actually really positive driving around town because it felt like it had plenty of grunt to get up to speed quickly . Um , there were a couple things that were a little bit more disappointing . The biggest one is that the while it had a lot of low in grunting and grunts at low speeds . I felt like once you were at speed , the engine was a little bit underpowered . Now , again , my car has twice the power , so I know it's not a fair comparison . But if you're on the highway , say going 60 or 65 you want to overtake somebody and go up to 75 or 80 and I felt like the engine actually struggled just a little bit , really .The one drawback of the X1 eyes in driver involvement and this was something that was actually pretty disappointing . So things like handling I know that it's a crossover slash SUV . I know that the seating Hyde is a lot higher . Even then , I felt like the car had so much body roll in turns in . Just the Elektronik steering was just not communicating any real feedback to me as a driver . And that was disappointed for really two reasons . The 1st 1 is that it's a BMW , for God's sakes , right ? What happened to the ultimate driving machine ? I realized this isn't their sports car , but I kind of expect that every BMW . Is gonna have a certain level of driver involvement and driver focus . And I really didn't feel that in this car . And it was made even more disappointing by number two . And that is that this one respect with E m Sport package . I mean , the steering wheel had an M logo on it , for God's sake , Like in your face . This is BMW's motor motor sport , So the combination of those two things it's just really disappointing that the dynamics really weren't there . That said , I feel like a lot of people who buy cars like this aren't really necessarily looking for driver involvement . That's not high on the list .They want something that looks really good that has a good amount of storage .Our space eyes , relatively fuel efficient on can get them from a to B in on all of those fronts .The X1 is a great car .It's really just in that driver involvement where I feel like it falls flat S O . If that's more important for you , it's just one thing to know . It was a little disappointing about this car .So overall , the X1 is a cool car . I can see why BMW sell so many of them . Um , it was the first time I had been in one . I was pleasantly surprised by by the majority of that experience . Thank you so much for watching . I hope that this was informative , even if it wasn't quite up to the same standard . Since I didn't have all of my camera equipment . And for those of you who are more interested in videos focused on wth e m cars , my car , I have a couple ideas coming on the next few weeks that'll focus my car , So stay tuned for that . Otherwise , thank you for watching . And I hope you guys take it easy ."
101,159,X7,"Theo . Guys , welcome back to another one . If you were new to the Channel I of Gold Pony Today we're in the all new 2019 BMW Ex seven courtesy of apple BMW in your p A8 . So I will be going over absolutely everything about this one for you guys . So is always let's start with pricing answer .To start , there will be two different setups for the 2019 . Except in there is the ex drive 40 I that is going to start at $73,900 . Then you have the X drive 50 i that one is going to start in $92,600 .But so then , as you can probably imagine , judging by the trim levels there , there are two different engines set ups available for the X seven first , one being the three litre , twin power turbocharged inline six cylinder that is gonna belong to the extra F40 I that we have today . That one puts out 335I horsepower 5500 rpm and 330I pound feet of torque available at 1500 rpm . Power is going to be sent to all four wheels through BMW ex drive . All wheel drive system . That power is sent of ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which we will test out a little bit . Here , 0 to 60 time BMW puts it out approximately 5.8 seconds , with mpg numbers coming in a 20 in the city , 25 on the highway , and the X seven will give you an auto start . Stop system is well , so when you're stopped , a stops on or red light S7 will turn off automatically for you . Saving a little mpg is there as well , but the other engines set up along into the extra 50 I that is going to be a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged V8 , this one putting out 456 horsepower around 5200 rpm , �479 feet of torque available at 1500 rpm again sent all four wheels to an eight speed automatic . But on this 10 to 65.2 seconds , which is crazy for a three row SUV , by the way , and mpg numbers coming in at 17 city 22 highway . And so before we do any kind of acceleration in the X seven . I did want to mention there are some Dr moves located just behind the shifter there , and they're going to include ICO pro comfort sport and adaptive , which is really where the car decides what driving mood is best for your particular situation . But they're going to just things like the shift points . The Ronald response and the steering sensitivity is , Well , it's so . But now , having said that , let's put the shifter all the way to the back into the left that is going to give you that manual shift mode . If you wanted it that let's do a quick little acceleration test with the paddle shifters . I want to see how quickly they react for us and overall , see how quickly we can get this one here up to speed .God , I love it .You guys do two things . Paddle shifters are lightning quick , probably among the fastest I've ever experienced in an SUV and really any vehicle . Really . They are insanely quick and , to be quite honest , the extra F40 I that we have today plenty of power . I don't even see you needing the V8 , but definitely no issues with merging onto the highway or anything like that .But so then to go along that acceleration braking is equally important . And so , of course , you will find four wheel ventilated .This breaks that comes standard on this one and in my short drive today have had absolutely no issues with a breaking feel or anything like that . When it comes to the handling it suspension on the X seven , you will find a double wishbone front suspension in the back of lightweight multilink integral rear suspension and one of the best parts about the X seven . Contributing to its smooth ride is there is a to Axl self leveling air suspension . It's so this is basically gonna automatically adjust its height based on road conditions , meaning If the X seven cents is you were going on the back roads going a little faster than perhaps you should be , it's gonna lower the X seven a little bit , providing a little better handling . And at the same time , if you're just cruising , it's gonna raise that height up to not only give you better ground clearance but give you a more comfortable ride as well . And it actually gets better than that because you can manually adjust The height of the X seven is well located just behind the shifter there . That's gonna give you the ability to raise the X seven up 1.6 inches above the standard setting if you wanted to . So really quite a bit of control . And again , with that air suspension , you're going to get so much of a smoother ride as opposed to an SUV without it . So definitely a very high end suspension setup , if that is a thing so very nice there .As faras cabin noise goes , it is a very quiet cabin , definitely no issues there .Syria feel is , as expected , not the heaviest in the world . But it is , as expected for an SUV , so we're good there as well .But when it comes to visibility , it is , as expected , for a three row SUV , not the very best I've ever had . And , of course , if you have that third row up , there's Head rests are gonna impede visibility ever so slightly in the back as well .But still , you're gonna find out on any three row SUV , so it's really not an issue for me , but it actually gets better with visibility because you do have a head up display right in front of the drivers site , giving you the speed limit as well as how fast you're going and a given time . So that is definitely nice as well .But that is about it . For the driving dynamics , let's move on to the next year because , like I had mentioned , the 2019 exception has been completely redesigned for this year . So without further ado , let's check out the exterior of this all new 2019 except in its due to start for 2019 .Probably the most obvious difference is going to be that larger , active kidney front grille to the sides . Adaptive led headlights will come standard that will come with automatic high beams as well , and led fog lights just below .Also , one thing you're going to notice about the exterior is there are satin aluminum trim details throughout the entire exterior self . We'll find some near the lower part of the front bumper up there , but they will continue on to the side and the Bacchus well , but make your way to the side .Satin aluminum roof rails , satin aluminum window surrounds , power folding heated side Mears will come standard with led integrated turn signals , a swell that take a look at the wheel set of 21 by 9.5 inch wheels are gonna come standard . It will come with run flat all season tires along with them , and there are plenty of different optional wheels started , including the 22 inch design that you were currently looking at right now . But then make your way to the back . You will find a rear spoiler with an integrated brake light back there .Just below that , a rear window wiper led tail lights will come standard , of course , and I don't wanna mention there is a chrome horizontal bar that ties together the two Taylor . It's thought that was an interesting design cue ball on this one .Also , before we get to the exhaust er's A5 $150 towing package , that's going to give you a towing capacity of �7500 if you wanted it , which is more than enough to tow a small boat . Just not a yacht , but still definitely a good bit of towing capacity for the X seven . But just blow it all . Dual exhaust outlets back there So you guys know we have to do next . As always , Here is that exhaust clip .It's open now , since we are round back when it comes to that rear lift gate , it is a power lift gate . So simply just press the button on the key found That's what I did and it is a two piece lifted , so it's gonna open up the top part and then you just press the button on the bottom that's gonna open up the bottom part , So definitely pretty nice there . And once you have that open , there is actually a cargo cover tucked away underneath the floor storage there as well , if you wanted it . But one of the best parts about the cargo area is everything is power operated . So there are buttons in the cargo area that you simply just price and walk away . And it is gonna pull down that third row seats bumping the cubic feet nus up the 48.6 . And there are more buttons if you press that once again , folds down the second row , give you 90.4 cubic feet . So , like the space beloved , the fact that it is all power folding definitely convenient . And the same goes for putting their seats back up a CZ . Well , you just press the buttons and the automatically full back up for yourself . Definitely pretty nice there .But then let's make our way to the rear leg room because we all know Third Rose sometimes don't always fit adults . 1/3 road leg room is going to commit a 33.3 inches . I mean , even six feet tall . I did manage to fit , but it was not comfortable . So third row is probably better left for small children , as it is with most three row SUV is out there .But I also want to mention for that third row they have their own individual moonroof back there . So a lot of times the cities will leave out the third of passengers , and they won't put a move back there . But for the BMW ex seven , they got one .Not only that , but there are USB charging ports in That third row is well for those children that need to power up their cell phones and iPods and all that fun stuff .But making your way to the second road leg room that comes in at 37.6 inches for adults .My six foot self more than enough leg room back there and what's against second row is access to the panoramic moon roof , By the way , shouldn't mention the X seven is available as a six seater or seven seater . So in this particular instance is is a seven seater set up for the center captain shares to make it a six seater . That is an option if you wanted to go that route . But either way , there's a lot of amenity . So their second row passengers , including with the premium package , get rear electric side window shades . You can get a rear seat entertainment package , which you actually looking at right now that goes for $2200 . There's also A4 zone climate control that comes standard so the rude passengers consent there and temperatures back there . There's also a rear center armrest with Call Poehler's as expected , but with the cold weather package , they get rear heated seats back there as well , and once again , USB charging ports and , of course , rear ventilation for all three rows , as expected .But now let's make our way to the front seats on this 1 16 way power adjustable front seats will come standard . They come with two way power side bolsters , A4 way , lumbar support and memory settings . And the standard finish will be a sense of tech upholstery . And those front seats will come heated . That is all standard , but there is a luxury seating package I wanted to mention that goes for $1600 . That's going to give you 20 way power adjustable front seats , and that's where you can adjust the back Rest with is , Well , it's kind of interesting , and there will come ventilated as well in the front there . And the best part of that luxury seating package is that come with the massaging function for not only the driver's seat but the passenger seat as well . So , after a long hard day's work and you need a massage , you got it in the X seven .But taking a look of front , there is a power tilt and telescoping steering wheel will come . Leather wrapped will come heated with that cold weather package that we have here , and that cold weather package , again actually comes with a heated center arm rests with just kind of cool because we still have snow on the ground here in P A . So you almost never find out of vehicles , by the way . So that is definitely nice . Then what comes to start up ?Let me first start by showing you guys the key here . You do have your lock unlocking the button , pop the rear hatch and by the way , always want to mention the lock button . Is the BMW emblem in the middle ?There also want to mention you may have seen this . There is an optional BMW touch screen key available that's going to give you a remote start that's gonna add an additional $300 .But that is definitely a pretty sweet key . But we don't have that today , so I'm not gonna go into detail .But I am going to simply just put my foot on the brake and press that engine start button , which is located just to the left of the shifter . There it still would start it up . You're gonna find BMW snu full digital display up there speedometers on the left tackle murders on your right . There is a digital speedometer within that and the navigation is actually gonna be located in the center of it all . And depending on what driving mode you put it in , these gauges are going to just slightly as well .But now let me make my way to the very best part of the X seven . Without a doubt the interior quality , starting with my favorite part on this one . It's the little things that count .This is a $650 option we have today .But what you were looking at now is the shifter finished in Swarovski crystal . That is definitely amazing . And that crystal finished comes not only on the volume knob for the radio . Also , the circular dial to the right of the shifter and the engines start button to the left as well .It is all finished in crystal . Panoramic Moon Roof will actually come standard on the X seven , so that is nice . But an option for the panoramic move to tie it all together is led . Lighting surrounds with different colors available for the panoramic Munir .If that is pretty sweet , that goes for $750 .Also , you will get a universal garage door opener , wireless phone charger and be a lighting .All of that comes standard , and you gotta love the to tune finishes in this one with the genuine wood trim . And this is , without a doubt , one of the most high end finishes I have been in quite a while . You guys definitely very nice , but let's make our way to detect display on this one .You will find Dole 12.3 inch color touchscreen display Is one of them being the gauges , of course , but writing center it is touch screen voice activated . Or you can use the circular dialling buttons just to the right that shifter so plenty of ways to adjust what's on that tech display there . Bluetooth and audio streaming will come standard . You will get Apple Carplay with a one year free trial . Their factory navigation again is going to come standard on the X seven , and you can check out your weather settings if you want T o . I found that pretty nice . And of course , the rating is sending zzzz well . And when it comes to the sound system , by the way standards set up , it's gonna give you a high five sound system with 10 speakers , 205 watts . If you want with the premium pack , you are going to get a Harman Kardon surround sound system with that , give me 12 speakers and 360 watts . Last sound system Set up available is a Bowers and Wilkins Diamond Surround sound system for 4200 . That's going to give you 20 speakers and 1500 watts and to date , in the 350 ish cars I've reviewed that is still my favorite sound system , by the way . But we do have the Harman Kardon sound system today , so you guys know we have to do next .Let's turn on the radio . So we got playing this morning and let's test out the clarity of this one .Definitely a very nice sound system . Plenty of base . I don't need the massaging seats because there was so much base , but definitely very nice . More than enough of a sound system for the X seven . By the way , another thing I wanted to mention to turn that radio up or down there is just your control available . That's what I've been playing around with quite a bit in this one . So simply turned your finger in a clockwise or counterclockwise rotation that's going to turn the volume up or down . Definitely pretty fun to play around with .But last thing on detective splay of one dimension is when you do put the X seven in reverse , you will find a rear view camera that will come standard on every single trim level . However , there is a parking assistance package available for an additional 700 that's going to give you a surround . You monitor with three D technology and parking assistant plus , where parallel parks itself , but definitely helps you out with visibility when it comes to putting it in reverse there . But as always , that is going to leave me in the safety net . So to start , there are front side inside curtain airbags in the back . There is latch , a K A . Lower anchors and temperature children for the rear car seats . Also standard frontal collision warning with sitting collision mitigation lane departure warning , blind spot detection with three across traffic alert and I also wanted to mention an off road package , and this goes for $1650 . But I put this in safety because you never know when you're going to go on some gravel roads or back roads or something . That or snow Where you might need this Because this is going to give you a mechanical differential lock and some off road driving modes , including sand , rock , gravel and snow . And this is gonna just things like the height of the X seven , the X drive system , accelerated response shift points and the DSC system as well .So But anyways , that is about it for this one . You guys , thank you so much for watching be Shouldn't like the video and subscribe your friend of follow me on social media at the bottom of the screen there and I will see you guys in the next video ."
102,160,Z4,"Welcome back to another one . If you were in the Channel High A gold pony Today we're in the new 2019 BMW Z4 A4 courtesy of apple BMW in your p A . It's so what ? They complained . Redesign . I am definitely excited to be in this one today . So is always you guys .Let's start with pricing answer to start the base M s r . P for the new 2019 Z4 well started $49,700 then if he jumped up to the m sports your level that we have today that what is going to start a $52,650 but regardless , power plant is going to be the same .Powering the 2019 Z4 is going to be a two litre , twin power turbocharged inline four cylinder putting out 255 horsepower , 5000 rpm , �295 feet of torque veil bold around 1500 rpm . Power is gonna be sent to the rear wheels through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters which you guys know we will be cells to get a little bit later here . But 0 to 60 time BMW puts it at approximately 5.2 seconds with a top speed of 155 miles per hour . And then mpg is there gonna committed approximately 25 in the city ? 32 actually on the highway .But before we do any kind of crazy accelerations in the new Z4 didn't wanna mention there are some driving modes available for this one of those driving modes of going to including ICO Pro comfort and sport . And essentially , what they will do is adjust the shift points of throttle response and the steering sensitivity as well . So what we're going to do here is putting in sport driving mood . I'm gonna put the shifter actually , all the way to the back into the left . That is gonna give me that manual shifting option where I can control the shifting and wear actually going to test out the paddle shifters now . So let me put it in first gear here and less touts out these paddle shifters along with the acceleration , actually as well .Definitely Lightning quick paddle shifters with out A8 doubt Never had any issues in a BMW with paddle shifters .Acceleration was nice . Definitely no issues emerging onto the highway or anything like that , but definitely wouldn't mind testing Audi turbocharged inline six cylinder in this one , either . But still , 0 to 60 and 5.2 is pretty darn quick . But something to go along .That acceleration , as always breaking , is equally important . And so for the 2019 Z4 , you will get ventilated front and rear four wheel disc brakes . And as far as the breaking field is , I've had absolutely no issues in my short test drive today so far . What So then , touching on the handling and suspension a little bit . The Z4 will give you an aluminum double pivot spring and struck type front suspension in the back of Central Link rear suspension with cast aluminum upper trance first lengths , and you will also find front and rear stabilizer bars , along with twin tube gas pressurised shock absorbers . And again , Since we have that M6 port package here today , that is also going to add a limited slip rear differential as well . So little better traction around heavy cornering There .With the curb weight of �3287 Z4 does come with a near 50 50 weight distribution as well .See yet another reason to have some fun tossing and around on the back roads and then touching on the steering . Feel little bit , definitely a heavier weight to it . You gotta appreciate that . But then again , that could be because I haven't It's sport driving mode , so that , of course , is going to contribute as well .But another thing with that steering feel is rips on the Z4 are mammoth . I absolutely love . It definitely gives you a better feeling of more control than this forest .High quality goes and just purposefully hit that manhole right there . Definitely no issues is going to soak up the bumps pretty well there .And this forest cabin noise goes . One thing I particularly actually like about the cabin noise here , as you can hear more of the exhaust note , perhaps it's because the Z4 is more of a smaller vehicle , but you can actually hear it back there .What's so that when it comes to visibility , of course , when the top is down , you could see absolutely , perfectly fine . Even when the top is up , you have a pretty decent visibility . It is more of a narrow view that you got back there because the top , that's it . A little bit lower , but still , it's a smaller car . So you're really gonna have absolutely no issues of visibility .And also , when it comes to that is , there also is a head up display available that's gonna come with the premium package . If you want it , that's gonna help you keep your eyes on the road a little better . Enjoy driving this thing on the back roads a little bit more .. What's so enough with the driving dynamics ? You guys lunch . Take out the exterior of this all new 2019 BMW Z4 . So when it comes to the exterior , let me first start with an interesting fact about the 2019 Z4 out . Pine white is actually the only color that comes standard on this car . Every single other color that you would choose to go with , including the San Francisco read that you're seeing now that is going to add an additional $550 . Just wanted to let you know . But nonetheless , up front , there is a Mercedes-Benz diamond block front grille . That was a joke . Kind of looks like it , but that distinctive BMW front grill is gone on the Z4 so kind of interesting there . But either way , it does look extremely good . Also want to mention that from bumper design will differ between the standard Z4 and end sport as well . For instance , the standard Z4 is gonna give you a black front lip upfront , whereas the M sport is going to give you a body colored front left .But two sides led Headlights will come standard along with led daytime running lights and with the executive pack . You can also get led adaptive lighting as well , meaning when you're going around the bend , it like those headlights will swivel based on your steering angle to better eliminate what's around the corner and then make your way to decide on this one .Fender , designed again will differ slightly , depending on what term you go with . For instance , the standard Z4 is gonna come with a single horizontal accent , whereas the M Sport is gonna come with dual horizontal accents up there and take a look outside mirrors .They are powered adjustable side mirrors with led integrated turn signals and just below when it comes to the wheel set up standards set up is gonna be 18 inch V spoke or big gray alloy wheels with the M sport that you're looking at . Now there's air Gonna be 18 inch M6 Polk Double five spoke alloy and there are actually plenty of 19 inch wheel designs available as well .If you wanted to make your way to the back , you will find it integrated rear spoiler with the center brake light . Just blow that led tail Light's definitely look good on this one . And just blow all of that . That rear bumper design again will differ slightly , depending on which set up you go with , including the M sport giving you a center rear diffuser that you're looking at right now . But just to the outside of that diffuser , there are dual exhaust outlets with chrome tips . So you guys know we have to do next .As always , here is that exhaust clip .It's open now , since we are round back to open that rear trunk , there actually is a button on the key fob to unlock it . So simply press that is gonna pop up in there for you . But once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna come in at 9.9 cubic feet that typically I'll make our way to the rear leg room .But there are no rear seats on the Z4 , of course , because this is a two seater . So when it comes to this front seat , they are 14 way power adjustable front seats with memory settings , and they will come standard with the sense attack upholstery and you will get distinctive and sports sees if you go with the M sport , trim level a swell . And what The premium package of seats will also be heated A swell which I'm definitely appreciative of today they're looking forward .There is a tilt and telescoping steering wheel and it will come blood the wrapped , of course , as expected , when it comes to the start up , let me first start by showing you guys the key here you do of your m sport designation on this key that you're looking out , of course , But you will find Locke unlocking that button popped the rear hatch . And by the way , I always like to mention the lock button Is the BMW logo in the middle there .But what's it side to start this one , all you need to do is simply just put your foot on the brake there and press that engine start button located just to the left of the shifter . Then what started up you will find BMW attended 1/4 into digital gauge cluster definitely looks amazing up there . I'm always a fan of that Till left , you're gonna find your speedometer along with the digital speed read out to the right . You're tak ometer on what driving mood you're in and in this center is actually gonna be where your navigation it's displayed . So if you see a line in the center there , that is actually road . So that's where the navigation system goes .But make airways overall interior quality will find a sense of tech dashboard along with ambient lighting . Definitely a fan of that as well .Universal garage door opener will come standard . It's gonna be right underneath the rear view mirror there .And there's actually a good bit of interior color choices available . A swell . And I do like the color that we got today . So good contrast with the black on that one .But now let's make our way to the tech display . Because yet once again , another 10 and 1/4 inch color touchscreen display .And yes , it is touch screen . You can also control it by using the circular dial and buttons to the right of the shifter . And it's also gonna be voice activated as well . But that is gonna give you Bluetooth and audio streaming and apple carplay one year for a trial . No injury , daughter yet . Although factory navigation system will come standard on this one as well . And you can , of course , check out your radio information up there .The standard sound system is gonna be a high five sound system . However , there is an optional Harmon card in surround sound system with the executive pack . Do happen to have that one today ? Actually , that's gonna give you 12 speakers and to base speakers actually under the front seat . So I think it is about timeless turn on the radio here . So we got playing today and let's test out the clarity .This one almost massaging seats . Definitely nice . Definitely a good bit of based on of clarity and really more than enough of a sound system for convertible . What's there ?The last thing on the tech display want to mention is when you do put the Z4 in reverse , you will have a rear view camera letting you know who or what is behind you , which is always is going to lead me into safety .Answer . To start , there are front and side impact airbags . Also , an auto dimming rearview mirror will come standard along with dynamic radar cruise control . It's definitely nice . Also standard frontal collision warning , automatic city collision mitigation and breaking daytime pedestrian detection . Also your speed limited , though , and I don't want to mention an optional package called the Driving Assistance Package that goes for $500 . But that is gonna give you a blind spot monitoring system and lane departure warning as well .And so , But that is about it for this when you guys thank you so much for watching the shadow like the video went , subscribe . Preferred a Follow me on social media at the bottom of the screen there , and I will see you guys in the next video"
103,162,X5,"What is up , guys , Welcome back to another one . If you're new to the channel , I am Gold Pony . And today we're in the new 2019 BMW X5 courtesy of Apple BMW A8 York P I . It's so today I'm going to try to not freeze my butt off here .So is always let's start with pricing . And so to start , there will be a couple different trim levels for the 2019 BMW X5 . 1st 1 being the X drive 40 I that is going to start at $60,700 . Then you have the X drive 50 i that one is going to start at $75,750 . What ?So that as you can probably imagine , judging by the trim level names there , there are two different engines . Subs available for the 2019 X5 . 1st 1 being the one that we have today , that is gonna be the three litre , twin power turbocharged inline six owner that , of course , being the engine set a pair to the x 40 . I would say that in line six cylinders gonna put out 335I horsepower 5500 rpm 330I pound feet of torque available around 1500 rpm . Power on that one is gonna be sent to all four wheels . Of course . Their BMWs , x drive , all wheel drive system power is gonna be sent to the ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which , of course , we will be testing out a little bit here . But ultimately , BMW says 0 to 60 time is gonna community 5.3 seconds for this one , with the PG numbers coming in a 20 in the city , 26 on the highway . But so than the other engines set up for the extra 50 I that was going to be powered by a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged V8 , putting out 456 horsepower around 5200 rpm . �479 feet of torque available at 1500 rpm , again sent to all four wheels through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters . 0 to 60 time on . This one , however , comes in at 4.6 seconds with M P G , number 17 City 22 highway . And yeah , 4.6 seconds is pretty crazy for an SCV . So that's definitely very nice . But regardless of what ended set up , you go with Dr Moods will come standard and there's drive Modes are gonna be located just to the left of the shifter there .But they are going to include ICO pro comfort and sport . Then there's the adaptive sending . But ultimately there's driving modes , air going unjust . Things like the throttle re spots , the shift points and actually the steering sensitivity is well , so let's just put it in sport driving mode here , and it did immediately downshift . Form A . So , like I said , it's gonna hold the rpm's in a much higher level there and actually tell the weight of the steering wheel . Got a bit heavier there , too . So I think I might just leave it in sport driving because I like the steering feel better .But before I go any further , let's do that . Acceleration tests here and actually , if you put the shifter all the way to the back into the left , that is going to give you that full manual shift . Men , where I have full control over the shifting here . So let's put it in first year here , and let's test out the paddle shifters .Lightning quick , Holy cow ! Absolutely love it in the end , Line six . Owner , by the way , is plenty fast , really , In an SUV , you don't need it 60 faster than 5.3 seconds . Honestly , definitely more than power emerged onto the highway or anything like that . So very impressive acceleration and very insanely fast lightning paddle shifters gotta love it . What's there than to go along with that acceleration ?Braking is equally important . And so , as you can imagine , you will find four wheel disc brakes on the 2019 X5 . And as far as the breaking field does , definitely no issues there . And that touching on the suspension in handling a little bit more than 2019 X5 . Actually , the platform has been switched to the cluster architecture platform . It's called , and that is actually gonna be showed with the new 2019 3 Syriza's Well , so up front you will find a double wishbone front suspension into back a lightweight multilink integral rear suspension , and I did what also mentioned dynamic damper Control is also gonna come standard on the 2019 X5 , and essentially what that will do is monitor each individual shock absorber and adjusting the suspension in milliseconds , really giving you the best of both worlds . What's gonna tighten up during heavy corner and giving you better handling ? But it's also going to read the roads and perfections and give you a more comfortable ride as well . And that is one thing I can attest to . One of the first things I noticed when I got in the X5 is regardless of these punishing roads we have here in P A8 is quite a smooth ride in the 2019 X5 very impressed there . But to go along with that , if that wasn't enough for you Oh , there is an optional air suspension as well .And actually that is gonna add $1000 to the price time .But it is a two axle air suspension . So that , of course , is gonna give you a much smoother ride as well .If you want it , it's far as cabin noise goes . You guys could probably tell him quite loud in this video because there isn't a whole lot of outside noise coming into the cabin . So that is , as expected in a luxury SUV like the X5 , I suppose .And as faras visibility goes , There is a head up display available if you wanted it , but I can see perfectly fine out the back . And the X5 typical is known for decent visibility . So absolutely no issues there as well .But enough with the driving dynamics you guys . Let's check out the exterior of this brand new refreshed 2019 BMW X5 it . So let me start by saying new for 2019 2019 . X5 has grown in terms of the wheelbase length and the width , but they're taking a look up front in the center .There , you've probably already noticed that kidney girl has grown as well to the sides .Adaptive led headlights will come standard along with automatic high beams and led fog lights , all of that being standard on the 2019 X5 and make your way to decide . You will find satin aluminum roof rails coming standard , along with power folding heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals as well . Also want to mention on the side . There there are sidestep bars . This well , for a little extra help , getting in the X5 , zooming out a little bit .There are chrome window surrounds of welcome standard . If you go with the M sport designed package , however , there's windows surrounds will turn toe black and take it .Look down at the wheel set up , you will find 19 inch V spoke aluminum alloy wheels , which will come standard . And , of course , there are 20 and 21 inch wheel sizes available . If you wanted to go that route , then make your way to the back of the X5 rear spoiler with integrated brake light again standard rear window wiper back there as well . Just blow led Talibs and just below all of that dual exhaust outlets with chrome tips . So you guys know we have to do next .As always , here is that exhaust lit ?But so now , since we all around back first , I want to mention there is a power liftgate that will come standard back there so you can simply use the button on the key five . But if you like , it's all power eyes , even the bottom section . You just press one button walk away , and then it goes down and up for yourself . That is definitely convenient , but once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna commit 33.9 cubic feet . If that was not enough space for you . Simply fold that second road down , which is done by simply just hitting one lever there . But once that second row is folded down , that bumps the cubic feet nus up the 72.3 Sogo bit of space there . And then , if you still needed more space , there actually is under floor storage back there and quite a bit of it as well . So if you wanted to conceal some groceries , that is , therefore is well or whatever you want to put their butt making our way up to the rear leg room that comes in at 37.4 inches .So for reference , I'm in even six feet tall .This so much base I have back there also , for there's a rear passengers , they will find a rear center armrest with cupholders . End with the convenience tear package . There is four zone climate controlled meeting driver , passenger and two rear passengers back there as well . All can set their own temperatures . That's pretty cool . In addition to that , if you go with the executive tear package , you will also find rear manual side windows sunshades . So I had that is well today someone to show that to you guys .And that's always useful if you have a newborn or kids that are sensitive to light or things like that to make your way up to the front seats , a sense a tech upholstery will come standard heated and ventilated front seats against Standard . They will come 16 way power adjustable , including two way power side bolsters , A4 way , power lumbar and memory settings . A swell .And for those demanding the most luxury possible for those front seats , there are massaging seats available only for an additional $1600 to that is gonna be part of the luxury seating package , it's called , but that is gonna be there for you as well .Take a look up front . There is a tilt and telescoping steering wheel . It is leather wrapped and power just a ble , and it is available to be heated as well , like 1/2 today . And I did want also mention it is very evenly heated throughout this steering well , so it's not just gonna be heated at the 10 and two positions . It's also heated on the top and the bottom , So that's always worth mentioning that when it comes to the startup .Let me first start by showing you guys the key here . You do have your lock . Unlock that button , pop the rear hatch . And by the way , the lock button is the BMW logo , By the way , in case you were curious , but if you want with the executive tear , there is a remote start that's gonna come with that one .But either way , you will get a push button start standard for every single X5 . And that button is going to be located just to the left of the shifter there .And so then once started up . Now one of my favorite gauge displays . Having seen this for the first time , it is a full digital display you got on the 2019 X5 year . Speedometer is gonna be on your left tack on murders on your right , and you guys could probably see there is a gray line across the middle there that is actually a road . So don't get that confused for some kind of technical glitch . It's not in the center . There is where the navigation is going to be displayed . So if you didn't want to look at the 12.3 inch display in the center . There , simply look at the 12.3 inch display right in front of the steering wheel , but then make your way to overall interior quality .A wireless phone charger is gonna come with premiums here . Executive tears gonna give you things like soft clothes , automatic doors , heated end cooled cupholders . This well , that is definitely pretty sweet . Any universal garage door opener will come standard for all X5 , along with ambient lighting .And , of course , there are high end finishes throughout this one . For example , on the one we have today , there are wood finishes throughout , as well as a two tone leather finish on this , also with mentioning even the latch to open up the glove box there in front of the passenger . Lot of times it will be a plastic that kind of goes with the front there , but it is not . It is an aluminum finish that goes with the trim accents on the doors , and the dash is , well , so big fan of that well done BMW .And another thing I found very interesting on this one . When it comes to fit and finish , the climate control located just below the tech display that is going to be a digital set up . So I definitely enjoyed that . And they're actually USB charging ports in the back of the front seats for the rear passengers in the back as well . So I found that pretty cold here .But let's make our way to the tech display because this is always one of my favorite parts . And again , as I had previously mentioned , there are dual 12.3 inch display screens , both for the gauges and the tech display there . But that tech display can be operated by voice touchscreen or the touchback controller just to the right of the shifter there .And that's gonna come standard with Bluetooth and audio streaming as well as Apple Carplay for a one year trial there , and a factory navigation system again will come standard . And when it comes to the radio settings High five sound system with 10 speakers in 205 watts , that's gonna be the standard set up for the 2019 X5 . However , there is an optional Harmon card and surround sound system for $875 .That's actually the one we have today and furthermore , there is another optional sound system being the Bowers and Wilkins Diamond Surround sound system . And you guys may have heard me mention it in other videos To date , Bowers and Wilkins is still my favorite sound system I've ever experienced . It is gonna be there for an additional $4200 but we do have the Harman Kardon sound system today , so let me turn on the radio and actually to turn it up . You gotta love the gesture recognition on the 2019 X5 . This is the first time I've ever got to play around with it . So all I've been doing is making circles with my index finger here and turning the volume up and down this whole entire drive just because I can . I absolutely love that nonetheless . Let's see , we got playing this morning and let's test out the clarity of this one .Definitely very nice Sound system . Ton of face . More than adequate for the size of the X5 cell , Harman Kardon does absolutely find in 2019 X5 What's so ?The last thing I wanted to mention is when you do put the 2019 X5 in reverse , a rear view camera will come standard , letting you know who or what is behind you so you don't running anything or anyone over which is always is going to leave me into safety instead . To start , there are front , side and side curtain airbags . Also in the back latch . Take a lower anchors and others for children for the rear car seats . Also back their rear child door locks along with rain sensing windshield wipers , meaning you don't actually have to touch the windshield wiper adjustments . X5 is gonna sense that and adjust them for you based on how hard it is raining . So that's always nice . Also , in all the dimming rearview mirror will come . Standard adaptive cruise control is available for an additional $800 .Also night vision with pedestrian detection , $2300 there if you wanted it .And you will also get standard frontal collision warning lane departure warning and blind spot detection with rear cross traffic alert .And so , But that is about it for this one . You guys thank you so much for watching be shuttle like the video went . Subscribe . I prefer to follow mails , social media , the bottom of the screen there and I will see you guys in the next video . Stay gold . Yeah , I think it's fine .The air is a bit too much . Let's turn you down .Keep it on that that you needed on Let's do this is going to be fun ."

So I'm super excited to be reviewing this one completely for you guys today . So is always let's start .There are essentially two ways you could set up the M5 the standard M5 , which is going to start at $102,700 then the M5 competition for $110,000 .Even with either set up , that you go with the power plant is going to be the same . Powering this one is a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged be eight engine putting out 600 horsepower , 5700 rpm , �553 feet of torque available at a very wide power band , actually from 1857 100 rpm . Power is gonna be sent to all four wheels through BMW S4 wheel drive system and that power is gonna be sent to the ground . There were eight speed automatic with paddle shifters and launch control . We will be testing out the paddle shifters than a little bit here . But when you put all that together 0 to 60 time for this standard M5 comes in at 3.2 seconds . This is a family sedan that could hit 60 in 3.2 . That is just ridiculous . And as you can imagine , it gets better with the M5 competition . That's gonna add 17 horsepower , giving you a 0 to 60 time of 3.1 top speed 190 miles per hour . If you wanted to test it out on the Autobahn in case you were curious , mpg numbers come into approximately 15 in the city , 21 on the highway with auto start stop functionality . So when you stopped at a stop sign , it's going to turn the engine off . Help save you a couple MP . Jeez , and you can turn that feature off if you wanted to as well .What's now before ? Do the paddle shifter test that did want to mention there an additional two paddles , if you will , on the steering wheel in red . If you were curious with those are there's air actually the memory settings for your drive mode . So there are a few different Dr Moods located just to the left of the shift . Or you can adjust things like the suspension the exhaust set up . We'll get to that as well in a little bit , but it does have two different Dr mood setups where you can save maybe for you when your significant others you get really better personalize the car to your own liking .What , so now , having said that , let me put it in that paddle shift driving mode here . We're going to do a quick little acceleration . We're gonna see how quickly they're react force here in the 2019 M5 things cars quick . But yeah , the paddle shifters are insanely quick . Definitely no issues there , more than enough fun on the weekends and my not cool crap . Yeah , this thing is sick . But so , of course , to go along with that acceleration braking is equally important and said the 2019 M5 will come with four wheel ventilated anti lock . This breaks with quartering , very controlling upfront . You will find six pissed in front CalPERS single piston , rear , CalPERS and as far as the breaking field today . I have had absolutely no issues whatsoever .Another thing I wanted to mention is when you do let off the gas , the exhaust crackle is absolutely amazing .But when it comes to ride quality , the 2019 M5 does comes standard with an adaptive and suspension with electronically controlled dampers really giving you the best of both worlds . Tightening up the suspension during heavy cornering and at the same time reading the roads imperfections to provide you with more of a smoother ride as well . And it also will come with twin to gas pressurised shock absorbers . And there is a comfort move when it comes to the suspension as well . So , in a nutshell , when it comes to ride quality , I guess you could say it's not gonna be asked to move this irregular five .Siri's perhaps what the trade off is , you're going to get absolutely insane power with this one , and really , the ride quality isn't all that bad anyways .Then , when it comes to the suspension first thing I wanted to mention when I first got into this one , I noticed this . The bolsters on the steering wheel are absolutely gigantic . I wish every single vehicle came with these kind of bolsters because they are a lot thicker than most cars out there . They definitely provide a better feel to your hands , giving you a better feeling of Maur control . I guess you could say that to go along with theirs grips , you will find an em specific suspension with the multi link aluminum rear suspension . And if you really wanted to push M5 if you go with that M5 competition package that is gonna give you a lower ride height along with retuned dampers also going to step in the springs in the anti roll bar by 10% . In addition to that , the front suspensions upper links have been shortened for slightly more negative camera to help improve front cornering as well . And in my short driving stick , today , as far as the steering feel goes , is definitely on the heavier side as expected . So of course , definitely a very nice steering feel to the M5 .His forest cabin noise goes , there really is lack there of cabin noise .It is a very quiet cabin in this one , as expected , says $110,000 car after all .And when it comes to visibility Really with any sedan . For the most part , we're definitely not gonna have any issues . And that is definitely the case with the M5 s Wellston . No issues whatsoever for May of one additional thing .When it comes to that visibility , there is also a head up display in a very large head of display . I will say as well give you not only your speed but the speed limit of any given road end . Your rpm's up there as well . That is definitely very nice . And I think with this head up displays , you can adjust it vertically and from side to side as well . So that is definitely something I thought worth mentioning .But enough of the driving dynamics . You guys let me get a place here and let's check out the exterior of this new 2019 BMW M5 Fitzer .Then taking a look up front to the side , you will find icon adaptive , full led headlights that will come standard and they are gonna come with automatic high beams is well , see off the whereabout that at night within that front grill , you will find a subtle M5 logo distinguishing itself from the rest of the five Siri's lineup , then make your way to the sides .There is that M designation within that front fender .When it comes to the wheel set upon the M5 , you will find a staggered fit mint 19 by 9.5 inches up front , 19 by 10.5 inches in the back . And if you go with the competition package , the wheel size is actually going to stay the same between the two , but will be a completely different design when it comes to that wheel set up .That's really the easiest way to distinguish between the competition package versus the non competition package that we have today but also want to mention the power folding side mirrors . Definitely a very unique design kind of looks like the top part of the side . Mirrors is gonna connect with the vehicle , but they actually don't and I like that . But regardless , they are power folding heated sign mirrors and make your way to the back . You will find an M specific rear spoiler . Just blow that led tail lights , and just below that , you will also find a center rear diffuser along with dual exhaust outlets with quad tips .And since I have continuously mentioned the exhaust throughout this video , one of my favorite parts about the M5 , you can indeed adjust that exhaust note . By the way , the standards set upon the M5 is with that more pronounced exhaust system enabled so that it's pretty sweet to you actually have to push the button to turn it all . Because , of course , if you're driving M5 , it has to sound like a performance car . And it does . So now that I have described it in detail , let me let you guys here for yourself and , as always , here is that exhaust clip .But so now , since we are around back , let me touch on how to open the rear trunk because the M5 does comes standard with a power Rio trunk , and there is the availability of it handsfree real trunk as well if you kick your foot underneath the rear bumper there but once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna come in 18.7 cubic feet . If that was not enough space for you , where there is a 40 2040 rear split so translation you can fool down .There is a rear seats for a ton of added space if you need it there making your way up to the rear leg room . There is 36.5 inches of rear leg room back there . So , for example , I mean even six feet tall . This is how much based I have back there .You're also gonna find a rear armrest with Cole Porter's rear ventilation , but you will additionally find rear heated seats .It is a feature that is almost always an option on higher and vehicles , but it is going to come standard with the M5 . What's there now taking a look at the front seats Here you will find 20 way power adjustable front seats . If you cannot find your perfect driving position with 20 way power adjustable front seats , you're probably not going to find your perfect driving position . Anyways . With 20 way power adjustable seats , you can imagine there are shoulder and thigh support adjustments . I've been playing around with them , and , of course , you do have memory settings for a couple different drivers as well .But looking forward , there is a tilt and telescoping steering wheel . It is leather wrapped and heated , and with some of the most pronounced bolsters I have ever experienced in a vehicle which I absolutely love .It's a bit then , when it comes to the startup , let me first start by showing you guys the key . It does have a heavy metal feel to it has the end designation colors on the side and on the front lock . Unlock the lock button is the BMW logo , but also the button pop the rear hatch .I am simply just gonna put my foot on the brake here and press that red engine start button located just above the driver's right knee . When it comes to the gauge set up , you will find a 12.3 inch digital gauge cluster , and it is actually fully digital . There is a speedometer on the left . Tachometer is gonna be on your right . There is a small M5 designation within that tachometer , which looks really cool . And of course , you will find your trip information different driving mood information and whether or not you're in two wheel drive or four wheel drive four wheel drive is gonna be standard . But if you turn off traction control , that is gonna put you in a rear wheel drive . If you are an enthusiast that believe that M5 should only be available on rear wheel drive . You've got it .They're taking a look at overall interior quality . Of course , this is finished in typical BMW fashion , with the sense a tech dashboard Marino leather finishes throughout aluminum carbon interior trim .You will find a universal garage door opener , as expected .Also , one of my favorite parts about the climate control is it is all touch screen in front of the shifter there . So to turn the fan up , it is simply a touch screen that you pressed to turn that fan up . Where to turn on the heated or cooled seat . Same deal . It is all touch screen . It's digital . It's pretty cool .And , as expected , you will find and be lighting throughout this one as well .But now let me take you guys to the Tech . On the M5 upfront , you will find a 10.2 inch high resolution touchscreen display that will come standard with a factory navigation system as well as Apple carplay , which didn't previously come on all BMWs . That's pretty cool , that that's there now , and you could check out the basics like your vehicle information or the weather forecast for wherever you are in the world .And then , of course , you could check out your radio settings and again one of my favorite parts here , because standard sound system on the 2019 M5 is going to be a 16 speaker Harman Kardon surround sound system with 600 watts ambient lighting within the front speaker that I noticed there . That is pretty intense as well . And you can turn that off you wanted to , but 60 speakers and 600 watts . I think you guys know what we have to do next . Let's turn on the radio and test out the clarity of this one .Theo , Definitely a ton of based , crystal clear ton of loudest . Didn't think I would have any issues , but really absolutely amazing Sound system , as expected , been last thing I wanted to mention on that 10 point to which digital display there is .When you do put the M5 in reverse , you will find a rear view camera , and it is a 360 degree view , which can be adjusted to view different sides of the vehicle or different angles . If you wish to is definitely an impressive one . I found about the M5 , but that , as always , is going to lead me into safety . And so you will find front , side and side curtain airbags . Also in the back there is latch , a k A lower anchors and tether shirt . Children for the rear car seats . Also , there will be an adaptive cruise control system along with lane departure warning , daytime pedestrian detection , blind spot detection , frontal collision warning , a city collision mitigation system and an auto dimming rearview mirror . But in addition to that , also a driver side dimming exterior mirrors Well , definitely don't see that on many vehicles out there .So But anyways , that is about it for this When you guys thank you so much for watching be shouldn't like the video and subscribe Perfect fall mailed social media , the bottom and screen there . And I will see you guys in the next video . Stay gold and it just"
105,165,2 Series,"okay . We just picked up this two CD BMW from living in Preston . We're gonna drive it home and take a look way .Try the transfer . Uh , there's quite a gap between my chair on the seat , but the seat is a good level for me . So this give it a go , as I've said before , sometimes transferred and takes me a while , but I'm doing it . Just assure you if it's practical or not .So we didn't . It wasn't about it is like a little edgier that you can actually lean on to kind of move in arms to get intimate more . I've been out of breath . Yeah , all know , I said , it's fairly easy .Okay , so it inside now . First impressions . It's a very luxurious feel to it . You've got the wood effect dashboard , which I think adds a little bit more of classiness to it .Then we've also got the ID drive system , which very , very easy to use . Red Easy .Ah , we've also got this amazing gearbox , which is the BMW his vision . It's no simple automatic . You can use the manual option or the sport moored whatever you prefer . It has different driving options . Then which we've got ICO Pro , which is for your farewell saving . We've got sport . The difference between them two is if it's in sport . The throttle is a little bit more responsive . E comm Pro is more for a town drive in which I personally like to use .It's got Park in San says he's got your individual climate control . It's got your C D player . It's got sat nav . We'll take a look at the screen so I can show you some of these things . So we've got your D A B radio FM AM is a CD player . Um , you got us B . Then we come back out there . We've got your blue tours to let your phone . I like that little off . You're on wait hours . You can't date . I like that . Then we got your SAT nav . We've got your connected , Dr . Then you got my vehicle . Which is what tells you little notifications about your vehicle . Tells you Miles . But Garland get average speed Really good . It'll feature I like stuff like that , but we're gonna go back to sat now .We're gonna take a little look at that now you can put it in your input on address . You can go to a recent destination , or you can enter a new destination . So if we go thio able to address in . But so this one you could either , saying it address . You can randomly select a poor scored . You can select a street in the house number and then you just click start route on it , Really , for me , the quickest way to get there . So overall , I personally I really like this car . It's really easy to get into . I think it's very practical .My personal favorite part are the electric boot on this last evening meal .Honestly have sound silly , but I've never felt the state and we'll have soft as this one .It's got your flappy paddles as well as you can see . You've been placed in the minus .And as I said , overall , it's a really good car .Um , just think what other features is may have a missile would look around .We got your automatic lights .We've got your little button to open the boot , which is a good little feature .It normally from inside on Diz Article parking sensors .You electric Hambrick , You're actually a park in center switch , which is really good .But as I said , overall value .So , um , this is the one good thing about the boot . Uh , let us Elektronik . So click of the button on the key on DDE opens . This is a bit of a dung for because , Well , it's just easy apart in the wheelchair and who will , Uh , But you need to take this out still , uh , after you this month , Realty itself . That can be a bit of a nightmare for some people .Thes seats do go forward as well individually . So if you gotta go through it , passenger and you still need together , we're changing . You can put these two dump where you could just put the one down Or , you know , it's quite surprising that a car of this size has got such a small booked . Um , it's quite shallow . Is not It's not exactly a deep because of because of the low load in , uh , this is actually storage underneath , but it feels quite flimsy , so I don't think it will hold much weight on that . As you can see , there's still some space left the site under the pockets to the site . Um , yeah , you know , like great . But it still works"
106,166,320d,"welcome to another episode of the disabled . Give us today we reveal in the BMW A5 20 d I am sport to it in X5 . Okay . To see a dick Levitt BMW in breast off ?No .Okay , so this is the BMW G20 D M sport tour in extra model .So I want to cover the guy . First of all , you can see there's quite a gap there . It does have the sports , but I do believe the sides quite soft . You also got this little cell , which is coming up quite a white doesn't make one big of a god . We're gonna get in . It doesn't have another seat as well . So it should be ableto help me slide in a little bit easier .Okay , so we aren't And there was a bit of a calf , but also , I don't grab my chance on his grave , but otherwise , the times for it's very simple .Okay , So first impressions when she got in the interior is something that is unlike any other car , just the standard car .We've got your entertainment system of year , which is all touch screen s . We've got your d a b . Radio FM . We've got a Bluetooth USB CD DVD . You can add different mobile devices on there . We've got satin off .It was great , very easy to use as head of the things that touch Bean or even come down here . And you can use the little novel . Yeah , which you can go back there on . The clever thing with this is , if you wanted to go in search for a new one , then to a new destination , Um , quick search what you can do . You can actually draw on this little nozzle . So then you can whilst you drive in , which is very simple , clever feature .Actually , as we go then it's amazing .Layer their soft taps steering wheel , which is absolutely fantastic . It's so comfortable we've got flappy paddles because you can also use this car as either a simple drive . Or you could go into sport more or into manual . If you prefer . It's also got automatic wipers . Automatic lights . Um , this one is also fitted with the BMW Do a gearbox . It also has three different satins when he driving . It has sport more comfort . Capo ICO Pro is more for your own town drive in , which gives you start stop . It's a very clever , clever feature . Tohave , Yeah , but I think this car all in all , it's absolutely fantastic .Okay , so this car also has a nice little bit storage in there , sometimes quite hidden to blend in with this high left dash quarters . We'll call it the 1st 1 I like is in here , which has got two little cup holders like stories straight the bottom and then to simply went Probably stuff in there . And you want to close in , hide everything about the way , press it back in the closet , Backer , the other one I like that I think is really different and clever is in here . We press a little button and then the both sides Papa and then say We've got a four week old wallet . You know , it's quite a decent size tray . Then we've also got the door bins , which are absolutely fantastic . They do fit a liter bottle of water in them . Then we also come in the glovebox . Glovebox is a decent size glove box . Actually , you know , quite fit quite a few things in their nice little trays storage , and they're all in all . It's kind of storage icicle Sr .The boot in this by 20 diesel is absolutely brilliant . Uh , height from the ground is fantastic for me surroundings . They go after the real treat so high when the real chairs in that got lost in a room in the back here the end Still quite a lot of room behind the future . Um , we'll share fits in who will , which is another borders for me because it's quite time consuming , taking it apart and putting it back together on the brilliant thing about this , too , is that it has the buttons here . If you do need to push the seats down , you're gonna stretch in . It does have buttons on the top . There they are . Electronic . If I press that button here . But of course I don't that's brilliant On also , I think my favorite teacher is the Elektronik Tilled it .Okay , so we are in the BMW A5 20 from Dick Lovett BMW Presto .So , overall , the drive is absolutely phenomenal .It is so comfortable . And I think if you have any sort of new issues or you have some physical disability , this car , honestly , it's so so comfortable with the heated seats on .It's unbelievable it just cruises alarm . There's no bumps .You don't feel anything that is like war noise , but that's no different to any other car .I think it's absolutely brilliant . What do you think of it ? I love this car . I mean , I love will be end up with this . But personally , this car . To me , it's just unlike unlike any other car driven .It's just so , so much luxurious field . Ray is just , I don't know . I just explain so nice .I think if you do have some sort of physical , I think it wouldn't matter how long in the car with him , five minutes or five hours , there's never gonna be a point where it does . It's just unbelievably comfortable . I struggle with my back . You know , I got a little pain in my box seats coming home from Breast the other day , just seeking positional this leg . Everything about it is just so . Last year was a perfect bite alongside their bombers from the door . It's just amazing .

107,168,318i,"Hello , everyone . And welcome to another video and welcome to the BMW 318 So , in the last video , I had mentioned that the next video will be about a drive in this car , Right ? Basically , that is what it is happening right now . I'm sorry for the son . I am going to give some initial impressions about this car . Although I must say that I have driven this car extensively like , Ah , Boulder driven about 1400 kilometers in about two weeks . So yeah , that's how much I've been driving this car . And the first impressions are it's pretty good . It's pretty good . So what we're gonna do is basically we're gonna go on a drive and have very quick first impressions . Let me show you how it is .However , let me just It's too hot .No , sorry about it . It's a seat belt .That's fourth annoying thing . I mean , it's TV chair against it , but it gets a bit annoying if you don't make the seabed .And the warning just keeps going on the first things First , I've come to this area called as Libre . It's a beautiful location , just located outside the city off Gerald and as you can see me behind me is the sea , and you could literally take your car right up to the beach . Just get my way out from here .My cars are dirty because it's u A n . The dust keeps blowing pretty much majority of the times . As you may have noticed , I'm in my spectacles because I'm driving . I need to be safe by death . So first impressions of this car .And to be honest with you , it's It's a very , very good car , although starting off with it's got an engine , which is about 1.5 liter three cylinder turbo charge . And because of that , if you totally underpowered sometimes because let it when you are about to overtake someone or unique power instantly , it takes a while before trouble charge kicks in . But the power delivery is free , linear , and because the car is , it's quite heavy . So the engine means very small , which is , by the way , from a Mini Cooper . Yes , the mini Cooper engine , which has been captured and put into this . So yeah , that's basically the reason why this car feels a little under former . Sometimes , especially when you're on the highway . And considering that you a road have pretty much all the roads are about 100 or maybe 1 40 So that that destroyed the power demand is quite a lot . Now we stopped at a junction now coming to a junction . Let me talk about another annoying feature . So there's this auto cutoff thing that basically , when you're standing at the traffic light , the the car , the computer on board switches off the engine order to save the field . Phil , what happens is every single time that you stop the car , just things that you are at the junction and it just switches off . And I can make do with that as well .Sorry about that . But everything that I'm the guard things that you are at the junction .So it just switches off the engine and there's a button that lets you basically override that system . But the annoying party is the car doesn't remember every single time . Uh , okay , still everything that time that I'm candy . Okay , let me just every single time I have to switch it off whenever I sit in the car . And that gets a little annoying because I want My God to remember Oops , a tunnel . But anyway , so every time you , uh , have to do that and the time just doesn't remember , so every time I have to switch it off and the car who didn't just remember that gets a bit off annoying . So BMW .Just make sure to correct that and the drive . The handling is just amazing . It Isolde precise . I mean , whenever I know I've driven different cars and especially the reason many ravenous if you have a fear off rolling over . But that's quite obvious . But when you sit in a sedan , I've driven on Ultima before and coming to this one , I can feel a lot of difference in the steering . Just immediately , the car points in the direction that you want , although I would say it's a little less responsive , and I sometimes don't know where what what exactly is going on when I am turning ? And for that reason , the feed bank is a little on the downside . But all of that removed the past still handled really well , especially on a roundabout or O . R , especially New A8 where you have a lot of round about and that's mean , I know I can go train 20 kilometers compared to the ultimate because I think basically it's because of the shorter wheelbase and also the way this car has bean designed . Now that there are some come some manufacturers that make breaks so sensitive . I mean the moment you step on the the dependent on the brake pedal calibers just gripped this breaks and it just stopped . Not in this case , this one is very different . Now whenever you just break the desert that there's like a softness to the pendant which I really like , which is basically if you raced . You know that you know a soft pedal is what you want because you have a tendency at high speed to to really push the brake harder than usual . And if your travel is very less or in other cases , if your brakes are very sorry , if your brakes already sent to do , then it immediately just lose your guard down . But this car , it's really good . It's really good . I mean , I'm surprised at how how nicely the pedal configuration is BMW well done on that department seating .I mean , seating is nice . I wish the seats are later . More softer . So , you know , on the long journey , it gets a bit tiring . But to be honest , I mean , I've dreamed this guard non stop for two hours after after two hours , I was literally tired . So on that department , Yeah , the thief's need to be a bit more often , but anyways , it can comfortably seat for people . As you can see , the bench seats behind , they can sit five people . But I think five people can really sit comfortably . I mean , four people is easy . What ? You can make people sick in Mr but five less . The fifth portion is really slim . One good thing is is that even though we're cruising at 1 60 noise N V H levels are really know in this in this cabin again , I'm doing an Altima , and Ultima is not a really bad car , considering that it's a huge car with all the comforts and safety features and every single thing . But compared to this car , yeah , it was it was pretty noisy , but this guy is so quiet . It's so I mean right now you you you can't you know , I really think that I'm going at 18 90 kilometers , but the air , whooshing noise , anything , anything . Even the engine noise is pretty damn low . So yeah , I think that's a That's a good thing in that department .So , yeah . I mean , engine I can forgive , like , BMW because , yeah , this is like a bass version off BMW . And for that reason , it cannot be like that powerful . And because the whole point of 31 it is that it has to be Ah , very affordable car .So what ? Yeah , that's pretty much it .I think the ice we drive more and more . I'm gonna come to know about all the different of the features and the drive experience . But these are just the initial few impressions about the car that Oh , so pretty . It's so pretty . I'm gonna I'm gonna show you are in the b roll , the entire footage that that you can see the view from your Oh , it's amazing .There is another point . So fueled the fuel tank . I think it's a little bit tiny because considering is just 60 litres . Andi , I I've had to fill it a lot if you go on a longer journeys . Although it does give you a decent amount of 13 to 14 kilometers leader . That's the average yes , have managed . And this is kind of a mixed driving in the city and outside the city on a highway . So yeah , I mean , considering that it's a very good car , because again that the tiny engine is when this work . So I think the balance is really good .So , um , I think as more and more recent driving this car , I'm gonna get more used to it . I'm gonna start finding more used more features , more things that I don't like .But apart from that right now , I think this car is really good on a budget because let's be honest . Yes , this is a budget car from BMW , but it doesn't feel like a budget car because it's bean made stole . Well , that you wouldn't really miss the other features off the other of the cars .And also the whole layout of this car is very good . I mean , I like less electronics , you know , distracting while I'm driving and it's pretty straight forward where you just press a button and everything is there . You have just A3 for sports and ICO more and comfortable more all of that . So You don't have to think about a lot when you're driving about . How do I put the moves on like other cars where you have complicated Elektronik pit and where you have to really concentrate , even if you want to change an FM station ? But in that case , this guy comes really alive .I'm getting off at the beach because I really like this view and I'm gonna sit down , you're for awhile and just enjoy this view anybody's . I hope you've enjoyed this first impressions of my car and there are many more videos to come and there'll be more off a detailed review . But for now , this is what I think is good and bad about the car . But overall , I think it's a very good bye if you're planning to . Because you know BMW is pretty good with handling , and that is what they are for .Make sure to subscribe because I'm going to go on so many Dr Oops , I'm sorry . Yeah , because I'm not put the car in park , So yeah , keeps reminding you .So you read on double If you like this video and make sure to subscribe because there are more and more adventures going to come in this car and there are more collaborations with different people . Also make sure to follow my instagram Facebook everywhere because I'll be posting all the updates and the photos on this car and various other events that I attend until we meet next time .Bye bye ."

109,171,M4,"Good afternoon . Good evening or good morning . Welcome to Supercars of London on Welcome to a very exciting video . You may recognize this car that I'm standing very close to that car there . That is TGS old Lamborghini Ray will drive hurricane . And that is right . I am here Red line because over the last 3 to 4 weeks , maybe even longer . I've been on the hunt for my next daily . The replacement to the Audi A one and sound from scene three glasses already beaten me to buy a brand new daily . He has launched a brand new and very epic banana a bath . And ever since starting the daily hunt for a new car , I've been quite keen to get behind the wheel off a BMW . Much to the hatred off Sam . I actually organized for one of our rental cars in Los Angeles to be a BMW M3 because I haven't had the opportunity to get behind the wheel of one of these cars and test them . When I made that video , the guys down at Redline drop me a message and said , if you want to come down and drive one of our M5 , then feel free to come up on Dhe coming , Dr One . Which off course I happily obliged because I definitely want to get behind the wheel of one of these cars and work out just whether this car could potentially be the replacement . It is , right ? Right at the top end of my budget . I mean , probably even over my budget . But I thought that they are seriously , seriously call . So with the stock that they have got behind may have got unbelievable Ranger stock there , you can see that there is a Yazz marina BMW hem for now , as a lot of you know , And if you don't know , then I will explain the history off the BMW em for on the Internet . Sam borrowed one of these cars Sam from seeing through glass the same guy that beat me to buying a daily . Um , he borrowed one of these cars and absolutely hated it . So that is one reason that makes me want to love the car things as simple as that .So here we have the BMW em for this one is suspect in Yas Marina blue , which is like a pale baby blue on absolutely stunning color in person . This car's still got the ah chrome grill around there , which I'm not a big fan of . I like it when there's a ll blacked out , as many of you will know from the Audi , anyone that I had , this car's also got the silver BMW performance wheels and inside , by the looks of it , it is black . And in the M3 that we had in L . A . It had carbon inside , which was absolutely stunning .Now , the other cars that are available in the M range , that sort of out of my budget is the M four . We've got the M3 , which is obviously the four door version off this car on dhe the M two , which is essentially the baby version off . This Carter is going to be a or rumored BMW em to C . S . L with this engine in which will be an absolute weapon .But from the outside , this car is a beautiful car . I have no idea what Sam is talking about when he says he doesn't like it . Ha ha . Inside , there is no carbon on this one . You can get carbon up there . You can get carbon down there and to be honest , I think it actually improves the interior quite considerably . We've got really nice black piano . If I sneak in because it's freezing outside , we've got black piano along the center concert , all sorts of different knobs and buttons and gizmos that I have no idea what they do . All I know is that starts the engine . So I'm gonna come and sit in the driver's seat . Alex is gonna come and sit in the passenger seat , and we're gonna shoot a quick video on the BMW m call .Hello there thing is exactly the same as the Lamborghini Aventador . No , the car talking about the way that we're shooting this video because my gopro hero A5 fell off the back of the spoiler off the novatek . So it's kind of smashed at the moment . It's still works , but I need a new suction cup . So here we go .We have got the BMW em for it is a three litre twin turbo engine . A lot of people have complained about the sound of this car because obviously the last M3 was the V8 sounded amazing . You could put really cool exhaust system on , but with an exhaust system this car sounds unbelievable . You get to hit all of the turbos and then the M four GTS has got all of those burbles and stuff .But then 40 Jesse's like 100 160 grand or something stupid like that , right ?What do these buns ? So one thing that I immediately like about driving a car like this is the fact that again all of this is quite unfamiliar . I have no idea what goes on on that screen . S o , I think .Oh , no , I'm in neutral . I'm Dr How about that Park off its Hambrick ?Take my foot off the brake and I'm not moving anywhere .Let's get the fuck ! Oh , no , I'm leaving .Okay ? I was expecting a little lurch forward from the automatic box .Before we go anywhere , I would just like to grab the camera and show you the dash that we've got here . That looks interesting . Efficient sport suspension and sport driving . I have no idea what that means , but I am going to look for the start stop button because the last thing I want it starts Stop Woman , come to a whole .This is so where the in Dr You still have to put your foot on the accelerator to engage the clutch and make sure that you're moving .S8 . Here we go . We're going for a quick drive before the sun goes down . I love the steering wheel . It's super chunky compared to my Audi A one . This is a really sort of nice . It fits . It fits right in your grip .First impressions of driving an M four Now I did drive a BMW M for driving Austin Yellow one from Southern Sky when I was doing there . What is the perfect model car on the M four was the car that surprised me the most . The Bentley , of course you're expecting it to be luxurious , respecting it to be incredibly powerful . The Lamborghini is the Lamborghini , but this car , because Sam in recent videos , has been quite negative . I want to stop referring to Sam and BMW and for even though it is quite a big factor , the fact that I'm driving this car because I just know how much it'll annoy him . The steering is incredibly nice and waited with wheels . Like I said has got a really nice field . It did surprise me the most out of all of the cars that I drove on the mobile thing . So to be able to get some more miles behind the wheel of this car , I'm quite excited . Quite excited .The M four is the two door version . So you'd have to open the door , move the seat forward to get people in the back . I have no idea what the head room is like in the rear of that car , so I should probably test the hour driving position .One thing that is stuck in my head throughout all of this process is four doors that were available in the Audi X3 sport back with four doors . It was just so easy to use . And you get that any Mercedes-Benz 45 as well . The car that I drove Our cheese has a cruiser .Comfortable suspension . Isn't that firm ? We're all getting a bit of , ah , steam coming up on the old windscreen . So try and get rid of that .That one just on the back , by the looks of it with those buttons I just got confused with it seems that there's quite a lot of modern technology involved with this car I've seen . We've got parking sensors shoot I really that night , but I have no idea what any of that TV screen does BMW em to .I've kind of discounted from my search because it's �55,000 1st is a hell of a lot of money for that car , but at the same time , with rumored M to CSL coming out , that car is gonna depreciate quite heavily on . To be honest , I can't afford to lose that much money , and I think it is gonna depreciate a lot .It's what nice is that rest so set up for that outside lane hanging up someone's arse with no indicators approaches . And it was just the bones of the driver . Exactly .Top get did stereotype the BMW drivers with the Bluetooth headset on all sorts of different bits . Check this out . This is why we've come up Thio Red Line for these sorts of roads and views . This is stunning .I'm actually gonna put over and take a picture that sounds good , like everyone was complaining about the V8 , but that sounds good literally . We came out cool pictures because the view's pretty , pretty stunning , and then Alex puts on accelerating it . Sound like that .Put on this right now . I'm now gonna put it into sport . Sport plus sport plus and see what ? The power . Hopefully I don't crash because I don't know in this car famous last words there . Maybe I put it in sport right now . He's got scared . Now . I haven't managed to try to break in a 50 miles an hour squeeze in the grotto .Boy's got some grunt . Thio , I do not want to go anymore . Back into comfort mode and traction control on was Harry these cars Herring , but oh my God , I wasn't expecting that band of'em for in the M3 .The starting price around 55 �60,000 wants you for options on they start going for silly money like 68 �70,000 . But you could be a big cup . I think this car's around 46 to �47,000 . So BMW m cars , they do depreciate . Andi , I suppose if you get an early one , maybe that has done the majority of the depreciation already .That's in comfort mode attraction or why did I take it out of No , I'm in neutral now . No . Okay . Stay in auto then whether that's a common trait of BMW A4 whether I'm just driving this car wrong but likes to get back into manual .So let's see .And I suppose if that's my driving position Oh , if I don't have a campout ahead by the glass there but okay , there's no there's no bad are half that I'd have to sit like this to get the headroom because the M four roof is slanted , so have probably sit like this . But there's a lot of leg room space look too bad .I just need to wait .Yeah , definitely like to redline for let me drive this car because I think I think we're now getting somewhere on the daily hum . I think we are on DDE . I'm excited . Sad If you're watching this , your hatred for this car is making me want it , So I mean , yeah , I really , really like this car I really like . I think this is the first proper time that I've done an actual test drive , driven the car on YouTube and like so I got excited .Mmm .Right . Enough of me thinking on camera . I'm gonna think off camera now . Comment below on whether you think this BMW M3 or in four is a good replacement to the Audi A one . I think it's a good idea . So give it a thumbs up and subscribe if you haven't already and check out the link for all of the stock that Red Line have including Thomas . Ray will drive Hurricane , that it's still here . But this is Yeah . This is where Tom picked up his F 12 . I met the guys down here when he picked up the F 12 . Very cool guys . Very accommodating and very welcoming . I mean , I have just got trained three hours up here to test drive a BMW A4 make a video , but I think it's worth it . Thank you for watching . See seeing these guys ."
110,173,X5M,"I think I've discovered why the BMW driver does not indicate it's because the human brain does not have the capacity to store all of these buttons and they just forget where the indicators are . It's not their fault .Today I'm in a BMW X5M , which is really an S S u V .If you think about the performance of this car , it can actually keep up with some pretty iconic cars for example , a Ferrari F40 , a Lamborghini Mercia Lago as well as a Mercedes SL s and the SLR . So it's really a supercar which has the practicality and utility oven SUV .However , is it something of everything or everything of nothing , which is really what I want to find out today ? This isn't a thorough review of the car . It's really just my thoughts and my first impressions .Drivability . What is this car like to drive ? When I first got in this car , I just didn't understand anything . There's so many buttons and different settings that it makes no sense to me . For example , there's three settings for your suspension you're handling your efficiency is always your transmission , and I don't know why you need that many different combinations and it's a lot . Don't believe me . Let's pause for math break , I told you . And there's so many things that you're just duplicative in this car , for example , you can change gears to the paddles or through the gear lever . Why ? Look , I want a core that simple , easy , and you just get in and drive . I don't wanna have to decide between changing between my paddles or changing between the gear stick . Give me one option , that's all . What I need . A yes or no comfort or sport . That's it . You don't need all these different settings . I know I'm going on around here , but I hate when people try and overcomplicate things . And when this car has so much potential to be incredible , for example , this display unit there's no touch . Why is there no touch ? Have to fiddle around with these twists and knobs and everything's like twisty and Nobby .Yes , this car has a lot of performance . In fact , it did scare me when I put my foot down . Oh , whoa . But again , it doesn't deliver it in the right way . Even when this car isn't at its most comfortable setting , it's still jerky and twitchy , and the brakes are very squeaky as well .In theory , it may make sense , but in practicality it's useless to these air .Just really my thoughts . It's by no means an exhaustive review of the car . In fact , I've barely spent any time in it as we speak . I'm rushing over to pick up my McLaren from McClaren ."
111,175,i8,"The great thing about this car is all you have to do is click the gear select to the left on it goes into sport by its modes sport mode .Hey , guys , welcome to supercars of London on a slightly different video to the daily vlogs that I've been producing recently . As you may or may not know , I have been driving around in the BMW . I ate 2014 BMW I given to me by BMW Sterling Way in Boerum would on Farsley .I just have to say this is the most futuristic car I think on the road today . It looks utterly insane from the wheel design to the way that the doors go up . The wing mirrors super curvy on dhe , the two tone blue on black black . As you get around to the back , you've got these weird wind intakes that basically move around the car and from the rear . This car is absolutely amazing . Q . Ball off the jokes to say this car looks like it's giving birth to a Porsche 9 11 from behind . If you haven't heard that joke before , look around the black and just the blue , and it looks like a Porsche is coming out off the back rather than give you all of the statistics to do with this car .Like most of the car reviews , I want to give you an insight into what this car is like to drive the amount of people that have come up to me in the street in London whilst driving , asking me what this car is like to drive . I thought that I would make this first drive or first impressions video so that you guys get to understand what goes into starting this car . What goes into the main sort of features and technological aspects off this car to do with how the electric mode runs , but also how the petrol engine runs .This car is filled with technology from cameras all around the car to make you reversing a lot easier , but also just how intelligent is and when it turns from petrol to electric . So let's jump in .I will show you a few features of how you start this car up so that you guys , when you get in your eye , you know how to drive . This car is super easy .Now I think I have been given the spare key because I'm pretty sure the ai a key is super cool . But as you can see , we have got many buttons . This is the unlock button , that top of the lock button , which if I do now , it will automatically do the windows up . But also fold the wing mirrors and then this has got the boot space . Let's have a look at the boot space and show you how useful it is .So this is all you get , but these are the two connectors to charge the electricity in the car . But the great thing about this car is you don't actually need to charge the electricity . I like the eye three .So this car's got super futuristic design . And if you look in here whether you can see that you've got the little clicky thing here that opens the door outwards like that , and you immediately get the carbon fiber reinforced plastic , as you see in the BMW A3 here on , you are welcomed by probably the most futuristic designed interior as well . The lines that sweep across this are utterly amazing . You've got the center console here that just looks like it's out of a spaceship . Amazing thing that you may have seen on my instagram is this interior loom in eights like the blue at night time , which is amazing . It's honestly amazing . One of my favorite features is the blue seat belt to match the exterior of the car .And when I actually picked this car up , I didn't realize this is this is how ignorant I wants to the BMW .I is a four seater car on dhe . We have fitted adults in the back of this car , including 16 foot man under the name of Harry Midway Smith , who is a London supercar spotter . So is definitely foresee that I took my girlfriend and mom out in it yesterday , and it makes a lot more practical and a lot more usable to drive on a day to day basis .Yes , Addition , One season Q3 s absolutely lovely . Now .I was just about to jump in there , but I got one more thing that I need to talk about the height of the door still here , the seats . It's so much lower than the actual door , so it makes it quite difficult to get in and out . But it's absolutely fine for males because you could just literally slide in like that and not your head at the same time . But if you're female , this is the view that you're gonna have a trying to get out of the car now if you're in a skirt , that it's probably not the best thing to do .But as you sit in the car , you're greeted with a beautiful steering wheel with this cool little design that shapes the steering wheel . You've got all of these features down here . These are to do with parking sensors . This sorts out the camera . These are the different most between comfort and E co pro , which is very more efficient . Traction off E Dr Start stop . You've got the gear selector , electric parking brake . You're so Sof multimedia thing that comes up here is all controlled here . Got a nice little storage space in there and also another one there . But it's not actually that big A3 cup holders , too , for the back , one for the front , very German on then . This , unfortunately , is probably my least favorite bit of the car is very BMW .I don't like the sort of 19 nineties look buttons a little bit off strength , and it comes down on dhe . This is the view you get in the wing mirror that I have been banging on about . It is so futuristic and so cool that I just never get bored of looking in my ring wing mirrors , which is a good safety feature , I think .But the one thing that I would have to say is , if you can see this bit here , this is no Whoa , This whole bit of the wing mirror gets reflected by the mirror , but this bit here never changes . But this reflection I will try and get this on camera , be near impossible to do This bit always flickers and moves like a reflection should , but this bit never does , because it is reflecting on this black corner there . It always looks like a car is in your blind spot . It is probably the only nickel that I have to do with the visibility of this car , because it's the weirdest feeling ever driving along on always thinking you've got a car in your wing mirror , just about to go into your blinds . But when really , it's just reflected on the extended pointy tip off the wing mirror .You might be able to see the heads up display here featured here tells you what the speed limit is on the road on . It also tells you the mile an hour you're doing on because we're in Dr .Even though you can't hear anything , we can actually pull away in electric mode and no one would know . No neighbors would hear you leave or return , because as soon as you put this car into reverse , it switches to electric mode .But as you can see , this car is super silent on very eerie if you're not used to electric cars . So now what is left for me to do now that I've said , the camera is to put it back into dr and do exactly the same maneuver because I did last time . Really intelligent part of this car is when it decides to go into electric mode or when it goes into Petra mode , and it does change on the speed and town driving . This car is designed to be very fuel efficient and green in the city .Andi , I think that is also helped with how light the steering is one of the main things that I felt when I first got into this car is how , like the steering watts , but also how easy it is to drive . You take your foot off the brake and it lurches forward , unlike BMW A3 , which is its younger brother or sibling , or something like that . Within the first few miles of driving this car , I realized that one . You can just put it around like every day you can put around like a night .Three . You sit a lot lower and the center a lot more hugging , which is really , really nice . And the one favorite bit is how high the sense of concern is . And I think that comes with a lot of supercars , especially the Lamborghini Gallardo . They start in the center console on this bit , is really high and makes a really nice arm rest . Ah , nde . Unlike the R8 , you don't actually have to compromise using one of your cup holders to use it as an arm rest . If you remember my cup holders in the R8 right down the middle , you he's using his cup holders or used it as an arm rest . You can use it but this has a cup holder on isn't compromised when I put my arm there .So I'm sure for those tuning into supercars aligned than expecting R8 tricks exhaust expecting loud noises for me to be pulling around in an electric mode off BMW . I know a great thing about this car is all you have to do is click the gear select to the left on it goes into sport by its modes , sport mode Dial's , which are currently blue and great , Turn red . Everything's turns red , and you are officially in sport mode , which we'll get to in a bit .I'll tell you what , however , whilst we're heading down to the petrol station bang into sport mode , so did you hear that ? Now I'm in sport mode . Everything turns red here on it just livens everything up . The steering is still quite light , but at the same time you can feel that it's just stiffened up a little bit and you just get instant power .Tell you what . This car is very , very quick . Now , a question that might pop up in this talking about the sound of the car is that yes , you can get an exhaust system for I have YouTube BMW I exhaust systems and there is a titanium exhaust system . This sounds amazing . One thing one little niggle that I have about this sound off this car might be able to tell is that it's played through the interior speakers of the car and I've picked that up . I actually haven't had this confirmed . I'm guessing so BMW I apologize if it doesn't actually do that . And this is a ll authentic engine noise . But I feel like it's playing from the inside of this car . Not sure where it's coming from , but it feels like it's coming from the inside , which isn't a bad thing , because it makes it sound really , really cool from the inside right now .Wait up shifts as well . And I think from the outside , after watching A3 one fifties video with which we did the collaboration a couple of days ago , this car does sound good and it looks amazing from the outside .It just takes off . And before you know , you have to put your foot on the brake just to solve . Calm yourself down because this car is really fast on the paddles . This car is really , really good . It also is quite selective as to when you want to be in a gear like right now if I go to third , I wanna go to third tries that I'm in second game .Now it goes to three and then back to two . So you have to accelerate a little bit before it actually selects third for you , which is a little bit annoying . It doesn't let you drive completely how you wanted to but again , these cars and automatic so kind of you to expect that no even want paddles . If you buy this car , you might never use the paddles . But me being may use the paddles .One thing that I completely forgot about Waas talking about the looks of this car and how it makes people feel there . See it . I have seen so many drawers hit the floor . When people have seen this car , so many people have committed What a cool car . So many people ask what it's like to drive because it just looks so futuristic . I don't think people understand that it is just a normal car . People probably think use a joystick on a hovercraft machine to power this car , But no , it's got a steering wheel . Is God gays ? It is a normal car .I think that's what the majority of the people that look at this car can't get their head around is just normal . But very , very special car is definitely up there with one of my most favorite cars I've ever driven . But you'd probably expect that because I haven't actually driven that many cool cars . R8 V8 10 Spider R8 V8 458 Help G5 16 This on an Aston Martin DBS and this definitely up there is one of the coolest cars I've ever driven . Biggest Wow , in this car , for me is the practicality and usability of this car every single day . I love the fact that I had my Audi R8 V8 . I love that car , but at the same time with the army tricks exhaust system , it wasn't the best daily . I thought that it was a really good daily until I've driven cars like this , but also the V 10 . Spidey felt like there was a split personality in that car , where you could use it every single day as an A3 , but then turn into a track focus .Absolute animal technology in this car , the cameras the reversing camera captures underneath the wing Burr in the front gives you a bird's eye point of view of this car , and you can watch yourself driving along like Grand Theft Auto in the olden days , Um , but this car then moves into the sporty loathe even that we have got a way that it just accelerated from the line .Just synchronization of the electricity and the fuel in this car just makes this car on animal .But it's so good handling as well , and it's just way too . BMW have engineered the steering to me that's slightly little bit lighter on the slower speeds . When you're driving around town indefinitely , when you're in E Drive , it becomes like a fear 500E . But then , when you really want to go for it , it just stays like an absolute treat . Love to take this car on track . And , um , it's just this car enables you to keep to the speed limits even round around about . Now that is something that not many cars could do . But the way this car handles how flat it is around corners , there's no sort of war , police suspension or anything like that . In sport mode , it really hardens up , becomes a supercar rival .That is , the best way to describe it is a practical four seater concept car , and who doesn't want to own a concept car .This car seemed really robust in the sense of how much you can have fun in this car , how much you can thrash it around a little bit around the corners .Put your foot down in the straits on because it's a BMW . You have that German reliability of , you know , it's actually put together properly and all of the wives of being connected properly where is in the Italian cars but also convinced the reliability of Italian cars as good as the German cars Straight This'll car looks awesome .Doors are awesome .Way this car performs is awesome .As I review , I think I nailed it . I think I have just one word I love how this Carlos I remember seeing this car get launched at the Motor Show was like BMW making that car , and I can imagine a mass audience that saw BMW A8 for the first time at the Motor Show . I thought that it was a concept car . Didn't think that it was actually gonna be seen on the road . And that's maybe why people's drawers are on the floor when I drive past , because that's to cancel the show . And that's the concept that what's it doing on the road ? And I think that's where people saw really get gobsmacked as seeing this car being hold on a minute . Wait , the car . That's I think that's that's where is on . I think . I hope I have noted it , nailed it because even in London that I get so many looks . I see a lot of eyes in London .I would always look , but I tended not to film because it doesn't have a big , naturally aspirated or even a twin turbo engine . It doesn't sound is called . Is the Lamborghinis Ferraris on dhe ?The higher end ? Even the McClaren's Clarence . I'm colder than this , so it's a weird one . But I still look at them . I still look at them go that is that really on the road in 2015 . It looks like it's 2020 cars so sad that I'm actually driving , and only about two or three miles away from BMW . Starting weight before I have to drop this car off very early as well . Very early . Thank you .

112,177,AMG GTS,"What's up , guys ? Welcome to Supercars of London on my one month review with the Mercedes AMG GTS . Now this first month has been completely different to any other . Off the first months that I've had owning a brand new car , I have pretty much driven on every single possible road that I feel that I could potentially come across when driving this car . I have driven it in the mountains in the south of Germany and Austria . I have driven in the hills in the south of France . I've also driven it in the tight twist , the underground car park roads off Monaco . But as well . I've driven on some pretty unforgiving roads here in the U . K . Where the road surface just isn't as good as some of the other countries in Europe . So with no more boring talk from the outside in the car , I'm just gonna jump in the driver's seat . Let's go for a drive and see where we end up .What better place to start the video than our petrol station 70 liter tank ? About �75 worth of field into the car we d'oh ! Let's kick this video off a 30 day summary or review the kickstart my ownership of the GTS and of course I want to make this video on . I want to continue documenting what is like to own this car to bring you guys along with the journey of owning this car , potentially falling in love with but just following its journey as it gets transformed further and further into a car that I originally envisaged on DDE had help from you guys as well . From the AMG modification video . Well , all of you suggested all of the different modification . Let's see where this day takes me to kick things off . Every time I start this car , it's starting comfort mode . It relaxes me into driving this car in a very comfortable way , and it just makes me happy . It makes me be prepared for the journey .Comfort mode shuts the exhaust valves , softens everything . I've got very life steering around the cities on around town , civic type of . But most importantly , all of the other modern technologies that we've got with parking senses the rare reversing cameras helps me when I'm moving around town with big bonnet that I've got ahead of me on what I'm driving at low speeds . It does feel really big . And as soon as I start picking up the speed going on the motorways or through the country length , everything in the car just seems toe shrink a little bit . Which makes the whole package on the whole driving experience just that little bit more enjoyable when you don't have to worry just how wide this car is , because it is crazy wide . But it just doesn't feel some of the time .We just suppose is one of the really good things about driving this around town is not as intimidating as it looks from the outside enough of the boring , slow driving town driving . I know this car is capable off being a very good city cruiser . Yes , the fuel economy is in that great star stop at least helps a little bit .But as a driving car comfort mode is no way you want to say you want to move it up to sport , which basically holds the gear ratios just that little bit longer stiffens up the suspension exhaust valves stay sharp , which is an interesting proposition for me driving it in sport , but I can flick it into manual with the top of a paddle on the throttle response becomes a lot more active .No more ready to go in the 503 brake horsepower 510 p s becomes a lot more available .I'll be completely honest . I don't think I have completed a full mile driving in school . This goes back to the A 45 a . M . G . That I drive . It just isn't really necessary . I haven't completely looked up into what it changes about the car .But if you want to go that little bit more aggressive than your freaking into sport , plus on immediately the car downshifts , vows , turn on on . All of a sudden you feel like you've got thunder right in front of you .You get a fantastic AMG exhaust that really does sound like thunder on the crackles on the overrun , just like lightning , that this is what this car's all aboutthe rumbling out of the back rear wheel drive instant power .And then this is where all of these buttons down here coming to play . I can flick it into manual and having completely Emmanuel time . If I'm still in sport plus mode and I don't want to take it out of it and I get caught in traffic . I could take off the automatic start . Stop . I confirm up this suspension I can take off the suspension just how I like it on even a low speeds in sport . Plus , this staring is relatively live , but just like the events and arrest me that I drove a southern sky , it comes to life , Freddie , quickly on this car becomes exactly what Mercedes-Benz to bay super GT-R when you want it to be .It is a crazy , crazy sports car .Relatively easy . Three points . So come for mode makes this car very easy to drive , very easy to live with and also very manageable in the town , but also on the motor races . I was kind of like cruising around perfect GT-R sport , I would probably say is it is a motor that I would never go in small , plus very exciting . We're breaking into race mode Revs on this car just become pretty amazing . If I take it out of manual , it basically thinks I'm on the racetrack signal . I mean , if I drive this car in race mode in automatic , this car calculates exactly my driving style to change gig exactly when it needs to .Right for the downshift .Every day's the gay books on this .What I was saying was , the gearbox on this car is so good , it never gets the wrong game .And the it just wants to interrupt me every time that I'm trying to say something .This car always puts a smile on my face . It is so easy to drive every single day on putting miles that I've already put on it colored bricks well in the race .So here we are . We have made it onto the motorway , one off the best places that this car sits on . We did quite a lot motorway miles on a European trip . So what better place to be , I suppose Thio kick off some of the quickfire Q and A's that you guys have sent in through Twitter and Instagram about this car , what it's like to have missed my Lamborghini , And how long do I plan on keeping the car ? Samuel Mills , on Twitter , has asked if I could change one thing about the AMG . What would it be ? Let's go back to when Mercedes-Benz R8 I didn't like I thought it was too soft on DDE . Not worthy replacement of the S and S . I didn't particularly like the S l s either . So it was crazy for me . 67 months later , having seen a few on the road Watch some reviews on cars , and I start to fall in love with it .But I fell in love with car the engine the interior more than I did the exterior . So as if you've seen the modification video , the one thing that I would probably changes to make the exterior a little bit more aggressive and shop currently looks like Steny 10 on Twitter has asked , When am I gonna take it drifting ?Of course , being a rare will drive car on being an AMG . This car enjoys going sideways quite a lot . When am I gonna go drifting ? I would love to learn how to drift out to control a car . Oversteer . Gonna skip pan . Take this car there as well so I could learn the limits of this car . The traction control off . Obviously I can't do on public roads because it is just unsafe . Car will probably be out of control around 90% of the time . That's illegal as well , so I definitely want to take it drifting over the summer . I'm gonna be looking up ways in which I'm going to call control lessons , drifting lessons , whatever it is . I definitely want to take this car there , and I want to learn about how to control a rear wheel drive car . Bodies on oversteer . Yan p I . Tech . I think that's how you pronounce name . And I'm sorry that has asked whether this was the perfect European cruiser . If I went on another road trip , would I pick this car again ?100% if you've driven this car bean in this car and you've been in the car with the Conference C's and I'm hoping to do a video with another AMG GTS owner in the coming days is just the company's car .I never had back pain . I never had any sort of body pain doing hundreds thousands of miles in this car . It covered the miles effortlessly .Cruise control on this car's phenomenal .We've got a good question here from you . Choke away underscored official through instagram results . Why I didn't get the addition one . On addition , one is basically the limited version AMG GTS , and comes with a fixed wing .It comes with a carbon roof .It comes with a pretty good speck and also comes with the A M G sports bucket seats .From an Xterra point of view , it's a little bit more aggressive as well . We've got a front splitter , some side scars on . It doesn't look good .One reason that I didn't want to get the additional one was because it's a limited car is going to be as Miley sensitive my Lamborghini walls . And that was one thing that scared me a little bit about driving a Lamborghini was just how the depreciation is gonna pay if I drive that car on more than one trip . So the mileage is was an important thing as well .But everything on the exterior , the fixed wing isn't Mercedes-Benz way M5 factory .And obviously , being me with it's a good thing or a bad thing . I wanted to make it a bit more unique than just in addition one , which is why I thought that I would go for it . GTS just one below . I have more options to play with when it comes to modifying the car , Jonathan May has asked a very good question . We'll have to think about when I saw the question , I really had to think about it . His question was , if the AMG GTS didn't exist , what car would you have gone forward to replace the Lamborghini ? And I think based on how close I got to actually bythe before putting out , knowing just how much money I have protection for the Audi R8 10 plus is a very cool car is starting to grow on people . I've seen a lot Instagram . I've seen a lot of driving about , and people are starting to realize that that car is as good if not better than a Lamborghini hurricane , but also looks just as good looks justice , aggressive .I've seen a couple on the road . They do look great , but I think once we start seeing some really cool specs , it is gonna be a really good looking one .Now you can pick them up for �120,000 . In the grand scheme of things . Looking a hurricane prices , it is an absolute bargain . You're getting so much car for your money .Riviera blue RS6 Mercedes-Benz about how do we make our call work well in the city and I think they have full about pretty much everything that covered everything because walks everywhere , works everyone . It's just I can't believe that if someone had said to me 18 months ago you are going to own a Mercedes AMG GTS and you are gonna be talking about base like this . You're gonna fall in love with that car . After selling a Lamborghini , I would have absolutely in anyone's face . You told me that because I didn't like I didn't like this car . And of course , the Lamborghini dream was so important to me on having driven the aventador S8 I still think the Lamborghini dream is alive . I still think it is there . I still think that I'm yet to experience and discover that really Lamborghini dream A5 his feet so that I suppose something I've realized it's driving the events of Rex .We're going back to Mercedes-Benz about living with Mercedes-Benz . Incredibly easy , incredibly comfortable , not stressful on this car makes me very , very happy . And I'm very excited to see what adventures I get up to in this car with this . What happens to this car with modifications . I'm still deciding . I'm still working on it and I'm still reading . All of your comments is toe what you want to see from this car ? Do you want to see any color you want to see after market wheels ? I'm gonna try and cover pretty much everything . Hopefully create the coldest AMG GTS anyone has ever seen . I don't know . There's gonna be difficult for his team . Got back currently falling around in a GT three speck road Legal A8 GTS . Oh , maybe the second coolest ."
113,178,AMG A45,"What's up , guys ? Welcome to Super Cars in London on a video . I wasn't expecting to film . However , last weekend was my birthday weekend , where I celebrated with a little weekend away with my girlfriend in the Cotswolds . And luckily , velocity cars were able to offer me this bad boy a 2000 and 15 a . M g a 45 Mercedes-Benz , but the right order of how it's supposed to say the car , but anyway , for losses , cars are a company that have an amazing fleet of AMG cars . You can check them out all of the links of description below . Anyway , they were kind enough to allow me to borrow their brand new a 45 AMG Andi . I have to say that I'm a huge fan of this car before I sat in the driver's seat . I'll tell you a little story about why I love the Mercedes a class so much when we jump inside and go for a little drive . But this video is more about a discussion about what I felt about this car when I took it for the weekend up in the Cotswolds . I kind of regret not filming because there was some amazing roads , so many cool country lanes twists turns straight , and I could really put the power down in this car thanks to its four wheel drive . So let's jump inside . Talk about what you get from this car as an engine as an interior but also as a whole . Package off , Ah , hot hatch and what it is like compared to the Audi Rs three , which I drove halfway through last year . So let's jump in . Check out what this car is all about .So when you sit in the driver's seat of the 2050 Mercedes-Benz F40 five AMG , you're greeted with quite a lot of stuff in front of you . Got buttons everywhere is actually really quite well designed . I have to say I do love the way Mercedes-Benz ein their interiors . Yes , there is a lot of buttons Mercedes-Benz no one of those companies that say simplicity is better , and you start over here .We've got all the electric buttons for the passenger seat . I've also got at my side as well .We've got the doors , we've got the mayor's hair and then , as you work your way across his beautifully designed steering , well , absolutely love gripping this much prefer a thick steering will , as opposed to a thin one . My Audi A one is quite thin , but this is quite a second . It's got some very , very similar similarities to the AMG GTS steering wheel . It's also got some lovely Alcantar obits here , which actually probably the best place for your hands to bay right by the gear levers . Where is in that the Audi Rs three ? They decide to do the Alcantara base here on down here . So your hands around the leather . But then everything else up here is Alcantar , which I actually love feeling the Alcantar and would love to have a car that has a falcon's iris . Deering will how you start this car up .This car's actually fitted with key . Let's go . So you put your foot on the brake like so that there is the start button around him . He presses on the engine , comes to life with the awesome start up , even cracked on the startup .And here we go said , this is the satellite navigation , just taking a little while to get set up . But it is very , very , very , very sporty . Let's say the radio down . Quickly , Quick , quick , quick , quick , quick . So I tend to listen to the radio down here . We've got the gear selector lever here with the AMG logo . Here . We got the drive selects . We've got individual reflections . Quite bad . Individual comfort sport , sport Plus And every time it comes up with a cool little features about how this car is set to drive on individual mode , you can basically set this car however you want , you can have everything . A sports is possible , the traction control off , which is ideal because otherwise you understand up in a bush somewhere . Even though this car's four wheel drive it is a bit of an animal to begin with , I'm just gonna leave in comfort mode and we can start cruising .Talking about what this car is like to drive . It is very easy and very similar to the majority of automatic cars . And I've driven you move the drive selecting to D , which is Dr Take a foot off the brake and the car lurches forward . Simple is that you felt the break .I mean cause so easy to drive back when I did . My driving test is if it was 30 years ago . It wasn't it was about eight years ago and it was a manual gearboxes and that I'm just about finding the biting point . I mean , my alright was manual , but for some reason , the way that cars a bill now is so easy and I suppose , lazy . And that might be . And I prefer it . No , because I'm lazy . But I think this'll PlayStation generation , where driving cars on games and it's all down for you in his or automatic is being implemented on all of these new cars and something like a hot hatch , which is built for the city but at the same time has enough power to get you wherever you want to bay as quick as you need to get that , it's just it's just an awesome , awesome little package that you can get in this car . I absolutely loved Mercedes-Benz get me wrong . I love the Mercedes , and I do think some of their newer cars are a little bit too curvy . When I first saw the GTS as well , I thought that was a little bit too curving , but I was definitely more Lamborghini . It was all about straight lines and angles and sharp points . But I'm coming around to the Mercedes AMG GT s . I have got a real soft spot for the A class . The new Mercedes A class , if you remember back potentially 2000 for 2005 Mercedes . We're bringing out the God awful at a class really high on it . Just looked . It didn't look very sporting . It was a family car on Mercedes is I did that . They wanted to move the class to a big glass , which then left a gap to try and target the younger audience . Which brought this the Mercedes A class hash . But the new Mercedes A class that came out It was aimed at the younger generation and it captivated me back when I was looking at my first car . I actually place an order for a brand new Mercedes A class 1 80 It was the cheapest model , but I just loved it . I loved the interior . I thought that it was really classy for you , for what you got for your money . It was a really , really cool car on , unfortunately at to cancel the order because it got delayed on . Then I went on board my 2007 Fox last year . S6 I . So I've got a bit of a ongoing relationship with the Mercedes A class so actually get behind this car . It seems relatively familiar , but there's still lots and lots of exploring to do , which I thoroughly enjoyed over the last a few days driving into the courts worlds are definitely played around with comfort sport sport .Plus , I haven't touched the individual setting because because this isn't my car . I don't want to set the car up to my individual taste because I'm sure the individuals setting has already bean set up for the losses of cars . But just cruising around , there's no real need to touch the brake pedals on these sorts of corners . Thes flowing men's . I could just keep my foot on the accelerator . The car's grip is incredible , even though it's awful outside rainy cars , Grip is amazing and cruising around in comfort mode , which , well , I'm gonna be doing for too much longer . In this video , the gear shift off seamless .I've just accelerated their on Dhe haven't found a single gear shift or you can really hear is the engine , though in the engine is actually really prominent in this car .And even though we're in comfort mode , we do have quite a lot of road noise . And that varies depending on what the tarmac is like . And I've driven on some pretty awful roads this weekend that it just is really , really quite intrusive .The suspension isn't that bad . I was expecting it to be a lot worse .I think the way that this car looks from an exterior perspective , you kind of expect it to be a real racecar for the road like source touring car stuff that you see around brands Hatch on is actually really quite enjoyable to drive , and it doesn't sort of break your back .It doesn't hurt the seats , even that these are the sports sees really , really comfortable . I was also worried not only at the suspension hardness , but also whether the seats were comfortable . Not because these are the sporty buckets . Six you can get from this from the energy range , but they're very good . So that's good .Well , I'm gonna do now . He's put it No Intersport because I think that's completely pointless . I put it into sport , plus , now I have no idea . What that does is telling me that he's got D . E S P is still on on the engine mode is now in sport . Plus , I don't really understand why there is a sport mode . I haven't explored that because I think based on the car's that I've previously driven , you either need it on or off on comfort is off . But on this sport , plus , I don't particularly feel the need for a middle ground between on or off . So what do you get when you're in sport ? Plus the suspension firms up , everything becomes a lot more responsive from the throttle . Steering becomes a lot heavier , which is very , very nice . Waited into the corners , and you do get a really , really good feel for the car , even though it's four wheel drive . That isn't actually that much understeer that I'm able to experience on public roads . So that , I suppose , is a good thing . If you take it to attract , it might be a completely different story , but for us , it's a car's probably be ableto help answer . That question is whether it is under steering . But then , as soon as I start playing with paddles , it goes down to three goes down to to get some lovely crackles .One thing that happens with sport Plus is the exhaust vows . Sport exhaust is activated Buttle times . So you get that bit of antisocial crackle . You're fantastic . Mid gear change blood like that , which it's also , and it pretty much happens every single time . Mercedes-Benz jin ear that into the exhaust system . Just dump a little bit of fuel out the back so that crocs and pops and crackles .I didn't do it that time . There's a first time for because it touched the break soon after , but it's got some lovely crackles on the overrun .It is quite an antisocial car when you wanted to say , But as you can see like it's so much fun to drive , and the great thing with this car is it is manageable power . Love using that word because in a car like best the size of this , you don't want any more power than you've already got on . And I just love putting into corners because it just eats them up . It is authority thoroughly enjoyable for May .I love the hot hatch package . I love the size of it . I love the amount of power that you can get . I know that there are other rivals than this on the Rs three nights to being the 135 and also the goal far . But I haven't driven those cars , so I can't really real A8 experience or a comparison to those cars .I have , however , driven the iris three and to be fair , driving pretty hard because I was on the press drive and we had a hill climb all to ourselves . But one thing with files open , this car doesn't know . Shut up .So whilst I'm driving this car in sport , plus , let's start a quick discussion about the price point off The hot hatches , and especially the Mercedes in the RS6 through the or X3 with options comes around the late forties early fifties , which is exactly the same as this car . So new they're pretty much exactly the same . Price . �50,000 Sounds like a lot of money for a hatchback , but let's start taking off some of the things that you get in this car and then see whether it works out to be Wasit . So what do you get for �50,000 . We get a whole load of brand new technology in this car . There's all sorts of stuff that I haven't even been able to explore .Get older .The lives of the blue to the cruise control the parking since the HD reversing camera , which I've never seen before , Inside is an awesome place to sit very comfortable and very , very easy to drive .So as a driver or even as a passenger , you get a lot of kids . Not only that , there's so much space in the back of that ship it in comfort because the gear changes are stretched out in sport .Plus , you get so much room in the back is not like any of these two plus twos in this and GT-R , which technically could potentially be in the same price point .If you've got �50,000 to spend , you get actual room leg room in the back of this car . So if you want a ferry three of your mates around easy . It's about as big as a bloody Range Rover in the back .You've got over 300 brake horsepower at your right for 335I correct in this car . More than enough power at any given time on any given right , If I just wanna make you make a little acceleration here , that's in comfort . Mode is so quick on because it's in such a small show , it feels really quick . It is just it's awesome . A4 World Drive as well , like here is almost like a chicane .I could just come in , take the corner . I'll do it again . Do it again and it is thoroughly enjoyable . We've got a bit of a camera on this one .You get so much for your money , and I know that they're a cheaper options . Potentially even used a 45 or used a higher X3 . But brand new . I'm talking about what does it compare thio potentially in the use market ? If you're thinking about the super sports car or even the supercar , I reckon 50 grand will get you F40 decent . Example . GT-R are 35 supercars slayers .Everyone knows it . You could also get a pretty good example of an early manual V8 R8 . One that I own fantastic are really recall . But to six not as practical as this .This is actually a really big boot as well , so if you want to go on the road trip before your maze , you could all bundle in this car .Actually does good fuel as well . 45 50 quid . 50 50 lead to tack on .You will definitely get between 404 150 miles on it on the long motorway cruise as a practical family car could get away with saying , This is a family cars , a practical family car you could also take for yourself These these cars are beat Audi RS6 300D S8 These are unbeatable . So I think I'm gonna leave the final drive with this . I think given the option if I was to own and daily Miss and GT-R Orin Audi R8 verses A4 A5 AMG born Audi pig .But if it was the only car that you had , you had to Bailey , I think I would , I think over both of these cars .And as fantastic as this is , I think the exterior is a little bit Larry the Rs three , slightly more understated . I just feel the interior slightly classy and everyone knows that Audi interior is is up there with the best I think I would have in our history .Fantastic cars . This is you could definitely pick up a bargain secondhand or even if you just want to drive this from velocity cars . They are an absolute food on a load of fun . So yeah , I think that's the best way to summarize what hot hatches are for me . It's my opinion . I love them on . I would love to . One day I'm great that you take it to the gym .I have a black town Audi Rs three because I do think they're fantastic on both this on the artistry was morse exhaust that just sound amazing on the crackles that are engineered into the car .Incredible . So I think . And I hope I've done this car justice and hopefully I think there's gonna be better people out there . Thio be able to give a more well rounded review of this car . But for the weekend I've had that is what I've learned . That is my outcome . That is off my opinion . On what 2015 Mercedes-Benz A4 to five years who voted out of that jump out against him shows you're ordering duties"
114,179,CLS 63 AMG,"Hey , what's up , everybody ? My name is Matt , and welcome to downshift . Have you ever taken a look at a Dodge Charger and thought That's pretty sweet . However , I don't want people to think I'm attracted my sister . Well , Mercedes , answer to that problem right here in the Mercedes C . L S60 3 a.m. g .All right , so I know I'm kind of making fun of the charger and everything , but if you as we go through this video , you'll really start to be able to tell the reasons that I make the comparison .We've got a big V8 under the hood .We've got four doors , It's a super sedan and we've got exhaust out the back .That's gonna scare small children . So let's take a look .Look at how aggressive this thing looks . Just first of all , right off the bat , it hits you in the face .Automatic high beam headlights are equipped on this vehicle with a beautiful led strip cascading down the top , A cz well , as 19 inch black painted a mg wheels with the multi spoke , it looks fantastic .This car is equipped with the midnight package , which means black mirrors and black wheels moving back . Of course , we have one of my favorite features , the key last entry , which is , of course , standard on Mercedes-Benz such as this . But just look at this thing . Look how aggressive that front nose looks and just cascading back the rear . 3/4 is really my favorite probably view of this vehicle . Although I will say straight from the back isn't that bad either . Look at those slits on the side of the bumpers in the quad exhaust . And then we have , of course , those little slits and parking sensors down on the rear bumper moving into the geometric quad AMG exhaust . And this , of course , is really exhaust . They are really connected to the pipes . They look fantastic , and the fact that they're really just puts it over the top for me . I complain a lot about the fact that a lot of cars don't have the really exhausted the little details , like the A filter back logo on the back of the key .Set this vehicle apart as well . Speaking of little details , every AMG engine is handcrafted in Germany by somebody at the AMG division . My boy Henrik put this one together and it was an incredible engine . So Bravo , Henrik .Of course , the little details continue on to the inside of the cabin with the AMG decal on the door sills as well as the a faulty Bach logo in Boston , the head rest and beautiful white seatbelts accenting the black bolstered seats . Of course , the seats are multi adjustable on multi memory , set for convenience and , of course , the rear peasant blocker shout out to Yuri and Jacob straight pipes . Uh , absolute love . You guys do a great job , but here it is the thing that I love about Mercedes-Benz their lights on , just turn off . They fade gently and the same thing with the back . Turn it on . Watch the shadow on the seat . I turned it off , and there it is , fading away .A beautiful head unit is accented by chrome vents on a slightly outdated looking head unit .But of course , you have all sorts of climate controls with hard buttons that I prefer , rather than being in . The infotainment story is plentiful , although it's not plentiful in the glove box is extremely shallow , surprisingly so . However , when you get to additional storage , such as the one between your seats underneath housing the first aid kit , Uh , and other places around the car , such as this side pocket cubby thing on the side of your center council . You really start to understand the fact that you have storage everywhere , storage for liquids , storage for cigarette ashes and , of course , the normal storage . This is actually super counterintuitive . I like the way that you flip up on that little lever and you open the center console , of course , to US bees in there for added practicality . What little quirk is where they hide the trunk release it is in the door pocket , and it is tucked away out of sight .Of course , going into the trunk , you'll notice the trunk is exceedingly spacious and the trunk lid opens without any effort at all . It is , of course , also equipped with a little tray for anything that you need to store or place in the trunk . Let's say beverages . If you're at a tailgate . The trunk is very deep and has additional cubbies and pockets on the sides as well as , Oh , what's this ? Yes , a little 12 volt US fair . Excuse me . A little 12 volt charging port right there because , you know , you might need that course auto closing trunk as this is a Mercedes product and you want to be bothered with closing it by yourself .Moving into the rear seats is one of my only gripes about this vehicle . It is four doors , but it is a little bit cramped . I can fit about two , maybe three fingers in front of my knees behind the seat in front of me on , and I have essentially no headroom . It's it's doable for short periods of time , but I wouldn't want to travel far in this .Rear Amenities , of course , include dual climate control events , a CZ well as another cubby here for storage with cigarette ashtray and another 12 volt outlet . And , of course , more storage . So where you can't store many humans in this , you can store a bunch of stuff .Of course , the rear center armrest folds down , opens up for additional storage , of course . And the cup holders , I think , was pretty cool the way that it opened .So enough about storage . Let's talk about convenience . You have parking sensors , but on top of that , you have cameras all over this car for a full 360 degree view .You throw it in reverse and you get it in your infotainment . Let's take a look at this lady on the right hand screen and look at the left hand screen as she goes into there . You can see her on your 360 camera . Top down display is fantastic , of course , moving into your head , unit and center console . You can control everything through Mercedes Command little wheel . And of course , it's not Audi . So it's not backwards . It makes sense , and it feels right . You can control things like your vehicle drive modes . You can obviously pair your telephone for any calls or texts that will read it out loud to you over the speaker system . Additionally , you compare your phone for Bluetooth audio . Of course , I didn't have my impaired at the time during this video , but you could do so . Radio was fairly standard and not new , but your nap screen looks just fine .One of the things I'm now realizing that I need is cooled seats , not just heated seats , but cooled seats three levels on both for this C . L s .And of course , it is equipped with not the bird . Mr sound system . But the Harman Kardon AMG buttons , adaptive dampers , electronic stability control and drive mode selectors are all hard buttons right next to you . And , of course , the Gear selector , which is one of my favorites , has the fault Urbach logo embossed onto it . It looks incredible .Finally , one of my favorite things about this car is the active bolsters . It'll hug you in turns on , and you can adjust all sorts of things about the seat right there next to you .The beautiful AMG steering wheel has Alcantar on nine and three of flat bottom and a racing stripe up top so you don't lose where you're at in corners going into the cluster . You see , the cluster goes up to 200 miles an hour and red lines just under 6500 rpm . Of course , in the centre Gauge cluster , you have a digital screen telling you all about things about the car , mpg drive modes and things of that nature . And look at that AMG steering wheel .Everybody were behind the wheel of the Mercedes C .Let's go for a drive .I really like the Falter Bach steering her Excuse me , the gear selector . It's really pretty cool . It's hollow . It's got the M Boston Falter back logo in it . It looks pretty .So the first thing that well , I should say that the thing that I love about MGs as a whole is the engine and the exhaust note Just turning this thing on it barks at you . Kind of like Then , of course , you rev it and you get the big throaty V8 sounds absolutely fantastic . This is why I continue to make these kind of comparisons between American muscle cars . The charger , for example , on something like this is because it's essentially the German version of a muscle car . This is Mercedes-Benz muscle end . They did a great job .Another one of things that I want to talk about immediately is the seat bolstering active boulders on this thing . There's something that you wouldn't think you would think about all the time , but the fact that they continually push up against you , you're into turns it really . They were constantly reminded that there layer on . They're really nice to have , especially when you're throwing this thing into ah sharp turn or something like that .Maneuvering around you really feel how long this car is ? I know it's the same kind of situation in the chancellor and the Charger charger . Excuse me , but it's not a small car . The seating position is very low toe lend to a feeling of sport and performance as it should , but it really is . A parent vehicle is so out of this engine we have the 5.5 litre twin Turbo um engine giving us 577 horsepower and �590 feet of torque . Uh , this thing is no slouch on to give you some contacts . The Audi R8 that I shot last weekend has just 520 around that 500E G20 horsepower . So this thing has quite a bit and you can hear it . Oh , my God , This is a thing . These these Mercedes-Benz mg products . They may not be the most 40 or the lightest for the most nimble out the most track focused vehicles . But it really doesn't matter like it really doesn't . It doesn't affect me at all , because I'm so enthralled by the sound and the noise and the visceral aggression from the exhausted and of course I mean you've still got things such as the adjustable suspension and dampers wth e gearbox and drive drive mode .Selector is having letting you have all sorts of control over how fast you want the car to shift . This is Mercedes seven speed speed shift , AMG speed shift transmission , which is lovely . It's no problem with me .Additionally , the paddles air nice . They're aluminum there feel really well made . That's my biggest problem with paddles and cars these days . Sometimes they feel really plastic and cheap . These feel very nice .It's really in keeping with the whole theme of this interior . Here , everything is really high level quality . Some of the interior components are getting a little bit dated . The Little center center council kind of thing here with the kind of telephone pad looks a little old . It's of course , refresh . This is 2015 but still it's just exquisite cabin love . The steering wheel . It's a beautiful flat bottom , with Alcantara on nine and three , and then a nice racing stripe up at 12 o'clock toe let you know where you are in corners .We're gonna pitch it into a turn here , active bolsters . The suspension is tuned for sport .So I'm gonna compare it to the Audi again .The alright , um , power in this car being a more heavy car and more luxurious cruiser . It doesn't come on and snap you in the back of the neck . However , you really the power comes on linear linear early on , and it kind of creeps in on you and you hear the engine , of course , roar at the back of your head and , um , it's it's just a different kind of experience . It's not quick , agile , kind of like a like a car would be , but it's got definitely a lot of muscle , and you can really tell a CZ the power starts to come on . I have mine in sport plus setting right now , and that's gonna quick enough things like the throttle response as well as making the suspensions differ . And immediately you can tell my foot down next to the phone right here .Oh , my God . I think , Yeah . So that's that's a lot of that's a lot of engine . Okay , I don't have anything journalistic to say about that . That's just emotional . Oh , my gosh .Yeah , that's a filthy right here . Yeah .All right . Coming up to a turn again . We're gonna pitch it in a little bit hard , coming into a nice 90 degree . Turn it about 30 miles an hour .Here , get on the gas . There's a power .That's good stuff . That is good stuff .All right , we'll give her some cash . Here there is . Oh , it's just all kinds of V8 rumble . All right , so , um , with the power in the engine , here it is Twin turbo . And you do notice that . So we just came out of a turn and I put my foot hard down now , whereas in the R8 that I drove last week , power would have been instantaneous , naturally aspirated vehicle this car , you do get a little bit of leg . However , once the turbos spool up , you really get going . You really feel it in your lower back . The pollsters actually start to hug you a little bit . Maura's you accelerate just to kind of hold you in place . And I mean , the power comes on and it comes on hard , but there is a little bit of leg with turbos . However , it's not something I'm complaining about with this engine Note exhausted . Sounds fantastic .Can you tell they like the example go into All right . So we're in manual mode . I'm gonna wait till we get past this intersection here .Dropped two years .There it is .Probably dropped another gear .I mean , this car is it's just good .It's It's comfortable .It's I think it looks beautiful .It's fun to drive .It's all sorts of power and just aggression and emotion .I mean , V8 there's really nothing to complain about here . Um , if you're gonna argue with me over the American muscle versus this , if I'm gonna make the comparison which I did So I'm sure I'll hear from the comments , Um , you are gonna pay more for this . However , you're gonna get more , you're gonna get more car out of it . You're gonna get more refinement , more luxury Maur kind of cruising ability than you would in a charger . But , you know , it's it's it's it's speculative . It's your opinion at that point , Um , I happen to like Mercedes-Benz in . However , I haven't driven a hellcat . So maybe I'd like that too . But this thing , it's just something else .Well , there you have it . Ladies and gentlemen , that is the Mercedes Kharj . C l s C . L s 63 AMG . I know I've been throwing a lot of shots at the Charger on , and to be completely honest , I don't have any it starter . It's a fantastic are American muscle . This is essentially German muscle . I mean , it's a fantastic car . It's a lot of fun . And you still get the practicality of four doors and four usable seats , more or less in the back . Anyway , I hope you really enjoy this car . I want to give a humongous thank you too , Tony . At you Mansky motorcars on Mercedes of Milwaukee North for letting us play with the C l s . I had a great time shooting this . This is an amazing car . Um , and it's a decent value .It's a 2015 but you get it $70,000 .So go over there and check it out . I really recommend it . So I hope you enjoy this video as always .

115,180,A180,"I just want to do a quick review of the Mercedes A 1 80 I've got mine going back today because I'm much too going overseas for a bit on dhe . But I thought I'd be a good thing to do because I've actually had the car for about 20,000 miles nearly a year . Um , because I know a lot the car reviews you see are from people that just driving it for the day or whatever . They don't really know what car . Um , okay , they could get ahold of the state wheels like this stuff that's in the manual . Anyway , what I want to show you is the good points and bad points for the Mercedes A 1 80 it's first thing in the looks of it is very sporty .Um , you ever look outside ?It is quite asleep looking car bonnet curves down back , salt around in on As you can see . It goes up and over , and then they're back , drops down quite quite interior . While I see it's a pretty good , very sporty looking on quite notice outside . But that same sport e look , is where some of the problems are .The first thing is because it drops down at the back and so , like it's got narrow window at the back and it curves around thieve you out . The back is pretty useless . You might want to pull that up because you can't tell any judge distances from that window . It's terrible . The front Exactly the same problem . It curves down . Oh , sorry . Different problem , same same issue . It curves down so you can't judge the length of the bomb it because there's nothing there to gauge it against , which is a really big issue . But if you're not a confident person for parking , you might have issues with it . Wing mirrors . Same problem curves down , but you got because it rounds at the back . You can't see the back of the vehicle to judge the distance .Very well , Um , because the sides curve the pillar for leaning on on the window is too high up , not a biggie . But when you're in a long on long journeys , I like to sit there with my arm on dhe . Just relax . I can't really do it in this . You get used to it . But at the same time , pillars too high on TV , Jack the seat up . The ceiling's too low . Those those are the bad signs .Um , the goat sides mpg another . I think they push it about 78 mpg . I get about 55 to 60 on . Some of those runs are like 300 miles on the motorway . So if I'm not getting up to 65 70 it's either there's something wrong with this car . Is something wrong with their figures ? Um , very difficult to reach the mpg is that they're selling this vehicle on because I've got the diesel version .By the way , um , the have a nice little box here , Handy for keeping your phone in and are bits and pieces . Um , it's got a USB socket . And I had phone socket on the USB wars into the data . The audio system . You could put the MP three player in there .Um , everything could be controlled by the style here . As you can see , um , you can connect a telephone to the system on dhe , also an MP three , or in my case , I have a Samsung know which I connect to the audio system . The reason for that is I forward my calls to my work phone . So the telephone's My work phone on the autumn system is my Samsung , so I could still answer every call . At the same time . I've got my audio system working so you can connect to Bluetooth device devices at the same time . But you can't connect to telephones as telephones , which probably something that will be a next generation thing , because obviously we got several police people in the car that might actually want to connect to the phone at some point anyway . Um , I do like the the everyone hates this display , but once you've been in here a while , you get used to it , but also because of the size of it and its location . It's in the right place . It's not . There's nothing negative to say about this . It does everything you want it to do . Um , okay , it's bolted on the front , but you get used to that . It doesn't really bother you want . You're actually using the car . It's It's I think German engineering people think cosmetic , where German engineering is about functionality and it's very functional .Um , the blowers worked very well . The air come works very well . Double blowers for the back in front . Witness way . See ? Kicking going . Well , Pacey works well . It'll switch on . I might not switch on with those . Yeah , you gotta guess which the blowers off to . Switch that on . Everything works great on there . You got the circulation inside the cab ? Um , speed control , temperature . It's all pretty good . Basic stuff .The design that Dr Bull and everything is nice .Um , the anti jacking thing when you put away the car doors out , automatically lock , which is useful . But when you're picking people like you gotta remember that something because I'm always locking people out . Ah , what I was gonna say about the car would I recommend them from somebody else .Well , let's put it this way . I'm going away for a few months . I'm hoping to get another one of these when I get back .Um , the view of the division issue is the main one in this car . If I had a scream , we reversing camera . That would fix that .Um , but it's a nice car . It's comfortable . You get looked at a motorway noise . I think the seal between the doors on the interior on very good . Um , the reason I think that is because when I opened the door , I can see a load of crap that blows up from the motorway . Which tells me that's where the air is getting in creating the noise when you're driving . Um , so that's something that could be improved by Mercedes .Um , general qualities . Okay , I wouldn't say it's fantastic . Um , I think the Mercedes is gonna be a mass market which is so okay , but their qualities being going down steadily for the last few years .Um , it's not . It was my money . I wouldn't spend �26,000 on this car . I think there's other options out there , but if I'm not paying for it and using it , I choose it because it's a nice night looking car .It's fairly comfortable .It's got everything where I want it . The display is good . The other thing that you know , if you buy like McDonald's drinks or something , you know , you get those plastic , uh , the paper cups . They don't fit in the holders . Um , not a major thing , because they're I believe they're trying to make it illegal now in the UK to drink driving even with a McDonald's . Um , but , you know , if you're driving for , like , five hours or something is nice to actually have these little things that make life easier for you .Besides that , the seats are very good . Um , it's a little bit tight in the back if you're a passenger , but at the same time , it's a car I don't really use for , um , other people in it . It's a work vehicle for me , but it's a family car . I wouldn't buy it . It would be the boots , Okay , but with the seats and everything , it might be a little bit tight on a regular basis .Um , but beyond that , it's a nice car . Um , I'll probably give it a seven out of 10 . Um , what license down is basically the vision issues , Um , because energy the engine runs really well .It's pretty quick , but also , um , it wants to go . It's not . It's not sluggish . Um , it what it will do over 100 and 50 miles an hour . No problem without even trying . Um , uphill . So it's not . It's not a car that sluggish . It's not a card . It's slow . Even with a small engine , I believe this one's 1.51 point six liter .Um , it's got everything there that you need as a driver on DDE .From a business point of view , it's got the nice look . It's got the right looks for a business use .Um , but �26,000 . I have a look and see if I can get a better deal or try and get a good deal on one of these because I the way Mrs Air pushing it , I assume there's a lot of good office out there . Um , I got this for free , so I can't really judge on that .But good car . Good . Stariye reliable , Typical Mercedes-Benz ."

Lovely condition .I mean , have a look at the leather interior electric seats . Isn't that beautiful ? Just nice and soft for a cover . 100 35,000 kilometers .

117,183,Sprinter Van,"Hey , folks , this Josh turning rich farmer . Welcome to the farm block today . Gonna be a little bit different today . I've owned my Mercedes-Benz her van for somewhere in the neighborhood of six months . And I wanted to do a walk around and review and tell you about this vehicle . The things I like , the things I don't like and what I buy it again . So stay tuned . We're gonna go ahead and wash it up . Go to a nice , quiet place . We can talk about the van . Is it worth it ? Is it a pain in the butt ? Is that little emblem right there ? Mean trouble ?First thing you need to know . When Ugo Sprinter Van is this , you're not gonna get out of here for less than that and you can't run it through a regular car wash .Let's get busy winds blowing really hard that way . Let's go back here .Let's talk about the inside of the van . Very , very rooming . Tana Room in the back front seats are very comfortable . Made of a nice material . Really like that . I do like the arm rest the arm rest are adjustable . Seek and flip him all the way back or he can flip them down . Raise him up to where you feel comfortable playing your arm . Very handy . Very nice . I'm six foot 5 �260 . Almost . I have a ton of head room , which is super duper awesome . The seat even raises up further for shorter people so you can see over the dash . But that's no problem whatsoever . Inside , you can hear . It's not so loud . It's it absorbs noise . This is the 12 passenger van version . I have two of the seats removed because we just didn't need that many seat the back seats for a long trip . Not comfortable . Okay . You want to put somebody in the back seat of this van for 10 hours straight on a long road trip ? They sit up like , straight up , like like military seats .Okay , I'm coming to you . Not as a guy that wants to live in his van , but a guy that wants a reliable piece of equipment to take him to and from where he wants to go tow , haul things , and I'll show you in the back . We've got some grass , seed and stuff back there . I have a farm blogger have a vlog on a farm . This is one of my farm vehicles . This is a vehicle used for hauling stuff for the farm , for hauling me and for hauling all the YouTube equipment around . Let's turn the camera around here .So I had an issue . I turn the key on . Oh , these little lights eliminate . We get a good beat Mercedes-Benz on now . I can't do anything . How I can turn it up and down . I could turn it on and off . But it always gives me this ridiculous warning and I can't do anything here . Okay ? Plays music just fine . The radio's just fine . Have a little SD card slot , and I'm told this little SD card slot is for the navigation . But I just put a bunch of music on there , and that plays okay , let me tell you about something .I don't like what burned me . I pulled up to my driveway and I rolled the windows down to let some of the man stink out of my van . Because I get in and out of this thing dirty and sweaty and sometimes our haul stuff that doesn't smell so good like trash . And if you don't completely remove this key . The radio will stay on indefinitely . So one night I went out . I stuck the key in the ignition . I went to roll my windows up . I rolled both windows up . I turned the key off the van , stayed on all night and killed my battery through a code on my computer and caused my computer tohave the service engine light on . Not cool . Not cool . I don't like that design whatsoever . I just do not like it .Door handles Aaron a Handi spot . Everything's handy over here . Nothing for storage whatsoever in the middle . And I have a tablet mount right here , and I just hung a trash bag . They're for my trash . But when I put my tablet in here , I'll put it right here and use the maps on my tablet . Also , we're gonna build a console to go in between the two seats right here . There's a cupholder issue here that has to cup holders here in the front , in the corners . Back over here . There's a cup holder right here in the hot sun , and there's a cup holder right here . Watch .This is garbage . It's garbage . If you want to put coffee up here on the dash . That's fine . It'll stay warm . But if you want to put a soda up on the dash so that the sun convey HQ down on it , that's not cool . That's not fun . That's not good . I don't like it . How many times have I lost a drink from this ridiculous cup holder right here ? Up here , above my driver's seat and the passenger seat ? There's plenty of storage . There's a little compartment right here in the center that can't hold a pack of matches . It's just useless . It might as well not even be there . You could put a pan up there , maybe , and the pin would just fall out .Every time you hit the gas , Let's get out . Let's talk about the outside now . The outside the van is rather attractive . I do like the look of the van looks no mean anything .If it doesn't function now , let's go around the outside of the truck here and it is a truck will tell you a little bit about what I like and what I don't like . When I bought the van and we took it on a 5000 mile road trip . This top window seal right here rattled and made an awful noise any speed above 70 miles an hour . Now , if you folks aren't used to driving that fast , that's fine . But when you're out west and you're in the middle of the desert to speed limits or 75 to 80 miles an hour , and I couldn't drive that fast because the van would go who it was so horrible . Our fix was to run a piece of packing tape across the top of my $40,000 van or 50,000 new .I'm not exactly sure what they cost new now , not something you think you have to do in a Mercedes van with all that Mercedes engineering Mercedes .Let's talk about getting in and out of this thing in the back . There's no problem I gotta handle right here . You can reach in , jump right in and you're good to go . Okay in the front . It is a problem . Some had some friends that have a little bit of difficulty getting up into a vehicle . There is no handle , there's no handle . The only handle is way up here . I'm six foot 55 foot five person can't reach this handle to get up in the van . So , in other words , on my grandma got into the van , I had to get behind her and boost her up into the van . Why isn't there handle right here ?Mercedes-Benz spoke a minute ago about the battery dying . I got up that morning to go to work , and my battery was dead . Well , what was I gonna do ? Jump it off ? Most likely charge the battery real quick . I've got a battery charger . That'll jump it off . Well , where's the battery ? It's underneath the floorboard of the driver's seat in a van in a utility vehicle . It's underneath the floorboard in the driver's seat . That makes no sense .Now let's talk a little bit about hauling and storage . This thing will halt �5000 of toe �5000 . Also , one of the things that gets on my nerves about this van is that it locks the back doors no matter what . So a lot of times you'll get out of the van . You'll be at home . You'll get out of the van . You'll turn the van off . You go in the house . You'll come back out . You grab this door handle and you'll be like and you'll be stuck and you have to go all the way in . Open the driver's door and the unlock button is not on the door . It's in the middle and there to unlock buttons . One unlock button just unlocks the back , and one on lock button unlocks all of them . It is moderately annoying . Let's look in the back . Plenty of storage . It has this little locking mechanism . I'll show you that this little bar right here kind of locks it in place . And if you don't want to lock it in place , you can pull that bar out and snap it back to the door . And the door can swing all the way open to this little magnetic holder over here . Hold on , I'll show you . So you push it closed . Put that guy back . He'll open all the way up and stick magnetically to the outside even with the slider door open right here . And we've got some grass , seed and tools and stuff like that in the back of here . I use this thing . This is a utility vehicle .All right . Is the van functional . Yes . Is it something that I would buy again ? Yes , but I did buy the wrong van if I had to buy this again . Being a sportsman , being a farmer , being someone who likes to go mountain biking likes to go running do outdoor stuff . I would have bought the longer version , the 170 inch wheelbase version , the high top version , and I would not have gotten the air conditioner unit on the top . I would have got the version . I think it's called the crew that has to two seats in the front and the one seat behind . Because the rest of it is truck . It's all truck , and I would've bought the four wheel drive .Let's talk about the four wheel drive situation . This video is going to seem like a grape fest about this van , but there are a few things that need improvement , and I don't care how big a fan you are of Mercedes or European vans . There are a few things that need improvement , the vehicles so long and so wide that when you get into a situation where you go like into a dip in a turn and when we're out in Utah and Colorado is when we experience this a lot . You would tip into that turn . You take it at an angle and one wheel would spend . So we got stuck in a spot that no vehicle should get stuck . I can't back it and turn it around in off camber dirt road area at all . I could not drive it in the snow . It's not good in the snow . I need a four wheel drive if I'm gonna have a vehicle that I can use is a daily driver in .This is my daily driver . As for service and serviceability , the oil change recommendation is every 20,000 miles , which definitely decreases . The service cost the amount of times that you have to service it . If you take it into Mercedes-Benz van service , get ready to pull your wallet out and spend $500 to get the first oil change done . Or you can watch this video right here where I went into the Mercedes dealership . I got all the paperwork he walked me through step by step . Everything I need to do for the first service of this van and for your subsequent oil changes . So every tiny minute detail is in this video right here . If you own one of these sprinter vans , if you're thinking about buying one right , there's your details .So let's talk about the height of the vehicle and how much that effects the maneuverability of this vehicle . So I pulled in a park and I'm down here in the park . It's a beautiful setting here . I'm down here in this park , and as I pull in , I rake the top of my van on trees . Okay , It's not a normal thing for a normal vehicle to be up that high Now . That being said , you're sitting up high . You have a huge cockpit here , you have a gigantic windshield that just gives you an awesome , awesome view of everything around you . So the visibility in this thing is super duper killer . I had an awesome drive when I drove across the country . We drove from North Carolina all the way to Utah , Wyoming , Colorado . My butt didn't hurt . My back didn't hurt . I could see really good enough . We're traveling west and the sun was going down . My face was being baked because this thing is a giant magnifying glass in the sun .Just so you know that to something you need to be prepared for is rock chips . You're going to hit Iraq in this windshield . It's like it reaches out and grabs rocks and cracks your windshield . That's something to be expected for a van this big for windshield this big .Now if you have to come out of pocket for these windshields , we got one from Safelite Auto Glass , and I think it was 220 bucks a lot cheaper than I thought it would have been .So let's list some pertinent positives and some pertinent negatives .The pertinent positives are very , very comfortable .Very high visibility , very good fuel economy . I got upwards of 26 miles to the gallon .Very spacious , lots of room , just tons of room . If you spill a drink in the floor , you can Just wiping out the windshield is a magnet for rocks .It's huge . It's big rocks are gonna hit it .That's it . The back seat is stiff and not so comfortable now . It depends on how far of a trip you're going if you're hauling kids around the neighborhood , if you're hauling the kids around town . If you're Holland people around town , it's fine if you're gonna have to sit upright in that thing , and then you might not want to drive it 16 hours or you don't want to ride in it for 16 hours in the back seat . No way . It's to the point that the back seats were so uncomfortable when my wife and I drove across the country . I told her to climb back there and go to sleep , and she didn't want to get in the back seat and go to sleep because it was just too stiff .The final negative thing that I experienced with this van is that it gets stuck on a wet banana peel . It just doesn't flex enough . The suspension doesn't flex enough , and when there's an area where it can spend , the tires can spend , it will spin on the wheel . That makes the least sense . So if I've got a lot of weight on this wheel and no weight on this , well , this well , sit there and spin and this wheel won't do anything . It's very frustrating , especially if it's just on a gravel road . Now imagine that in the snow , Not fun not cool , very slippery , and I just had a poor experience in the snow and ice .Another negative thing is you cannot take this thing through a regular car wash . You have to take it through a big truck like a tractor trailer car wash . You can't just drive it through the car wash word that spray will spray up underneath your vehicle . So you want to take extra care when you wash your sprinter van to clean all the way up underneath the bottom of it , so that it doesn't have those rest issues . Seems to have a nice , gooey , sticky under coating to protect it underneath , so I don't know . I don't know about the rest issues . It's a 2016 . It shouldn't be resting .So all in all , a grand overview of this van . Would I buy it again ? Absolutely .I love the van .I love the ride . I love the fuel economy of the four cylinder . I love the reliability of the four cylinder .The next print Obama get will be the long wheelbase . It'll be .The high top van will probably still get the four cylinder version . It will not have the rear air conditioning because it's just not important . And I'm told that they're prone to leaking and it will be a four wheel drive . Hands down . It needs to be a four wheel drive .I hope this helps you out in your decision whether to buy one of these sprinter vans or not . I want to tell you about a few things that were annoying to me . I did one review after driving it for 5000 miles . We're out in the desert in Utah and the things that got on my nerves . There are still the things that get on my nerves now . Now , are they deal breakers ? I don't think so . This is a great van . It's comfortable . It's a giant billboard for my business , which is super duper awesome . But I do have to think about a few different things when it's windy out . You can tell that it's a high profile vehicle . The cup holders , they're absolutely horrible . But stick around on the vlog . We're gonna build a nice console for this thing and cup holders for the front and back . It's gonna be super cool . Gonna be really neat to see . So , folks , thanks a lot for joining me here . This is a little bit different than the normal farm vlog type videos that I do . Click the like button . Give me some thumbs up . Put some comments down there . If you have anything to say , if there's some little fixes or little things that you know about these vans , please let me know , All right . So come on back and see me on the Stoney Ridge Farm . Guys , we'll see you next time . All right , way .Here's another annoyance . When I pushed the lock button and I'm more than 15 feet from this van , it won't unlock . Sometimes it won't unlock when I'm right up the side of it . I pushed the lock and unlock button , and the key fob just has to be really close to the van in order for it to lock and unlock . It's quite annoying , especially when you're used to having a vehicle that you can lock and unlock or hit the panic button and find it in a parking lot from hundreds of yards away . Quite annoying"

120,187,S4,"what is up , guys , welcome back to another one . If you were new to the channel , I'll go pony . Today we're in the new 2019 Audi S4 , courtesy of Sun Motorcars in Mechanicsburg P A . There there have actually been several changes for the 2019 S4 and I will be going over them for you guys today .So is always Let's start with pricing that So let me begin with the new trim level for the 2019 S4 premium trim is now available for the S4 , starting at $50,200 . Then you have the premium plus , which is the one we have today for 54,500 the prestige for $57,800 .But regardless of trim level power plant on the 2019 S4 will be the same . Powering this one is going to be a three liter turbocharged V six engine , putting out 349 horsepower , 5400 rpm , �369 feet of torque available around 1300 rpm . Power is going to be sent to all four wheels throughout these cuatro all wheel drive system . That power is sent to the ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which we will be testing out a little bit here . But Audi claim 0 to 60 time of 4.4 seconds . Motor trend puts it at 4.2 because we always know . Audi underestimates and over delivers every single time . But all in all , top speed comes in in 155 miles per hour mpg numbers 21 city , 30 on the highway .It's open them before we do any kind of acceleration . It did when I mentioned there are driving moods available for the 2019 S4 throughout these derive select button , which is located just underneath the climate control settings there . But that's going to give you modes like comfort auto dynamic , an individual , of course , individual being the one where you can really taylor the car to make it your own .But this Dr Musical , when you adjust things like the throttle response , the shift points and the steering sensitivity , actually , and all in all , dynamic is the best driving Moto have the most fun , especially in a car like the S4 . So let's put it in that dynamic driving mode here .Let's do a quick little acceleration with the paddle shifters . Want to see how quickly their reacts for us ? And let's see how quickly we can get this 2019 S4 here up to speed way . I can't stop laughing . This car's nuts . It's there . The paddle shifters are absolutely instantaneous , as they always have been in Audi , so definitely offended that acceleration is absolutely ridiculous .Really . There's no possible way you cannot have fun in this car and the best part about it . It is quite cold today here in Pennsylvania , but with the Audi Quattro all wheel drive , the power actually sticks to the ground . Regardless of the cold weather in a rear wheel drive car , you more than likely would not get that . But without the squatter all wheel drive , you still get amazing accelerations . When it's cold out , it's over .Then , to go along with that acceleration , braking is equally important , and so upfront you will find 13.8 inch ventilated front discs in the back 13 inch .Mentally , the rear discs as far as the breaking field goes . I've had absolutely no issues . There's no brake pedal delay or anything like that with S4 when it comes to handling a suspension off front , you will find A5 link Independent steel spring S4 sport suspension differentiating itself from the standard A4 in the back , the exact same thing essential . And as far as the steering feel goes , definitely Maurine the heavier side . So it has a nice weight to it . Here in the S4 ride , quality has been just fine . No issues there for me either . It is gonna ride a little firmer if you bump up the wheel size like we have today . But I'll get more into that a little bit later .But lastly , as Faras cabin noise goes , it does still sound like a luxury vehicle inside . There isn't a whole lot of exterior noises coming into the cabin .Did want to mention though this S4 exhaust is pop a little bit when you downshift . So it's not super loud , but it is there .You can definitely hear it , but so that when it comes to visibility , I have never had an issue with an A4 or S4 . So perfect visibility .When it comes to this one , and also one additional thing . One dimension is there is a head up display available .If you go with the prestige term level on this one , little added visibility helps the driver keep their eyes on the road a little better because their speed and speed limit is gonna be projected upon the windshield there . And it gives you some safety features actually upon the windshield as well . So that's therefore if you wanted it .But enough with the driving dynamics you guys , let's now check out the exterior of this new 2019 Audi S4 . It's they're starting up front . Of course , you will find that amazing looking Audi single frame front grille , and there will be an S4 designation within that .Gorillas well to decides , led headlights will come stated they will come with the automatic feature , along with automatic headlight levelling us . Well , that's definitely something usually don't find standard . Also , just above that on the hood , there didn't mention there are heated windshield washer nozzles . I want to mention that because I do live in P A . So quite often it is quite cold , and snow or ice will end up up there and of course , no will then fall onto your windshield when you break . And so when there's air heated . Therefore , you still have the windshield washer fluid to help get all the snow off the car , so that's always nice .But making our way to the side . You will find aluminum trim .Window surrounds power adjustable heated side mirrors with led integrated turn signals . Also , just below 18 inch devil five spoke alloy wheels with summer performance tires will come standard . However , I was mentioning the optional wheel size is what you were looking at right now actually is 19 inch double five spoke alloy , and that's gonna add an additional $800 . If you were interested there , then make your way to the vacuole fund S4 badging into back there , along with led tail lights with dynamic turn signals . And what that essentially means is when you have the turn signals on it looks like the led zehr sliding from one side to the other . Definitely cool effect there , and I almost forgot .I wanted to mention before we go any further , The exterior color on this one is called Quantum Gray . It's subtle , but yet different from anything else on the road . Definitely offend , but anyways , underneath the tail lights , there you will find dual exhaust outlets with quad tips .So you guys know we have to do next . As always , Here is that exhaust clip .It's so banal . Since we are round back when it comes to opening that rear hatch , there actually is a button on the key . FOBs is simply press that I feel like that will open up for you . And if you go with the premium plus trim level and up , you will actually have a hands free trunk lid release . So simply walk up to the S4 with the key , and that's gonna open up . But once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna commit 13 cubic feet . If that was not in a space for you , there is a 40 2040 split , meaning these receipts do full down for quite a bit of extra space there if you needed it . But also found in the cargo area are four cargo tie down hooks to side nets and to crow . Cherie looks as well .Then make your way to the rear leg room that comes in at 35.7 inches . So for reference , I mean even six feet tall .This is how much space I have back there . Also , those rear passengers will find every your center armrest with Cole Porter's , along with rear ventilation , and the particular S4 we have today does actually have the cold weather package .So if you notice there's rear heated seat buttons , that is how they got there .That package adds an additional $750 if you wanted it , but make your way to the front seats .There is a leather Alcon tear , a combination that will come standard for all term levels . And then we'll come 12 way power adjustable with four way power lumbar and the massage function for both driver and passenger . That's pretty darn sweet , and those front seats will come heated as well . But of course , there's plenty of options for the front seats , including a Napa leather interior package that we have that adds an additional $1000 .But that's also going to give you the quilted leather pattern that you also see right now .But taking a look up front , there is a tilt and telescoping steering wheel , and you will find that s emblem at the bottom of the steering wheel there and again with the cold weather package it will also actually be heated .Tadeusz .Well , it's soup with them when it comes to the startup . Let me first start by showing you guys the key here . You actually do have an s designation on the back there . But flipping that around , lock in , lock in that button to pop the rear hatch .Either way to start this one up , you will find a push button start for the premium plus trim leveling up . That's it with them once started up with everybody . Always wants to know is how did I get that Audi virtual cockpit ? Pretty men plus and prestige trim levels are going to give you that .And all of what is on that digital gauge set up can be controlled by using the steering wheel mounted controls on the left side there . But it's gonna give you things like the cars , information , Bluetooth , information , radio settings , navigation . Really , the navigation is the best part because there is a view button on the steering wheel there . If you press that , you can toggle between a full navigation set up across all of the gauges or just a small one in the left corner There with the tachometer being front and center . So that is , perhaps my favorite part about Audi is virtual cockpit .You gotta love that , but let's make our way to overall interior quality . Now . Three zone climate control actually will come standard , along with the black cloth headliner , power sunroof , aluminum interior trim . However , a lot of that aluminum interior trim actually has been swapped out for the carbon fibre trim .That adds an additional $500 .But we have a heck of a lot of that today , and being led interior lighting will also come standard along with eliminated door sill in lays , and you will actually get a wireless phone charger if you get with premium plus trim level that's gonna be located just underneath the center arm . Rest there .Now let's make our way to the tech display front and center . You will find a seven inch color display screen to control what is on that display screen . There's a circular dial in buttons just in front of the shifter there , but that's gonna give you things like Bluetooth and audio Streaming Android Auto and apple carplay will also come standard factory navigation also standard , and you can check out your radio information , of course , up there as well .Standard sound system , By the way , it's going to be a 10 speaker sound system . But there is an optional banging office in three D sound system available if you wanted it , and then it's gonna add an additional $950 that is the one that we have today .Let's turn on the radio . See , we got playing this morning and let's test out the clarity , This one .Ah , that was a fun song . Definitely a ton of base on this one . Crystal clear , Plenty of loudness . That is an amazing sound system for the S4 . More than enough .What's the last thing on the tech display of one dimension , at least , is when you do put the S4 in reverse , you will find a rear view camera with dynamic grid lines , letting you know who or what is behind you , which is always is going to leave me in the safety S8 . To start , there are front side and side curtain airbags . Also , what front driver and passenger need airbags as well . In the back , you'll find latch a k lower anchors and others for children for their car seats . Also standard a tire pressure . Modern ring system is well is Audi presense basic Audi pre sent city and the premium plus trim level that we have today is actually going to add Audi Side assistant , Audi presense , rear And lastly , the prestige term level that one is going to add adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist , Audi active lane assist and a top few camera system .And so but Daddy's about it for this one .

121,188,A4,"What is up , You guys welcome back to another one . If you were new to the channel , I am Gold Pony . And today we're in the new 2019 Audi A4 , courtesy of some motorcars in Makin Expert P A . What's so we're in this one today because I woke up this morning . It was 10 degrees out , kind of snow on the ground . I figured , What better car to drive in the snow then and Audi with the Quattro all wheel drive system .So without further ado , let's start with pricing . It said there will be a few different trim levels available for the 2019 Audi A4 , 1st 1 being the premium that is going to start at $37,400 . Then the premium plus , which is the one we have today . That one starts at $42,900 at lastly , the prestige that starts at $46,200 so that when it comes to the power plant on the A4 , there's actually two different engine setups .For this one . This standard engine set up is gonna come from a two litre turbo charged four cylinder engine , putting out 188 horsepower , 4200 rpm and �236 feet of torque available around 1400 rpm . Power is gonna be sent to the front wheels with that engine set . Otherwise , seven speed dual clutch with paddle shifters . And with that +10 to 60 time is gonna commit in approximately 7.1 seconds , with mpg numbers coming into 27 in this city , 34 on the highway . But then there is the optional engine set up once again , a two litre turbo charged four cylinder . But with this one , power output is gonna be cranked up to 248 horsepower , 5000 rpm , �273 feet of torque available at 1600 rpm . Power for this engine set up . It's gonna be sent to all four wheels throughout these cuatro all wheel drive system and that power again said to the ground through a seven speed dual clutch giving with 0 to 60 time , approximately 5.6 seconds with mpg numbers coming in a 23 in the city , 34 on the highway .And by the way , if you were interested in that engine set up simply add $4600 to any of those prices , I previously said , but so that before we do any kind of accelerations in the A4 did want to mention the drive motor , as Audi calls them Dr Select . That button is gonna be located just underneath the climate control options there . But that is gonna give you comfort , auto dynamic and individual on What do you say ?Let's put it in dynamic mode here . Basically , what they're driving modes are actually going to do is adjust the throttle response . The shift points and the steering sensitivity is , well , we'll get a little more into that later .But for now , I think it is time . Let's do a quick little acceleration than this . 2019 Audi A4 . Let's see how quickly we can get this one here up to speed .Definitely very nice acceleration .And the paddle shifters also tested out during that . They are lightning quick . That is one thing I have always loved about Audi .The paddle shifters have amazing response times when you hit him , definitely a quite nice acceleration in the 2019 A4 and so but then to go along with that acceleration , braking is equally important .And so the brake setup is actually going to differ slightly , depending on the engine setup that you go with for that 188 horsepower engine , you're gonna get 12.4 inch ventilated front discs in the back 11.8 inch solid rear discs . But if you go with the 248 horsepower engine set up that is gonna bump you up to 13.3 inch ventilated front discs and 13 inch ventilated rear disks , you're gonna get slightly more breaking power with a larger engine set up . Which makes sense .So figured I'd mention that is so far in my short test drive today , the breaking feel is definitely quite nice . There's no delays to the pedal or anything like that , but they're they're touching on suspension and handling a little bit . First thing I want to mention to you guys is when you do put it in that dynamic driving mode , staring field definitely tightens up . So , um , or instantly points you in the direction that you want to go . Gotta love that , but so what ? Front you will find A5 link independent steel spring suspension in the back exact same thing , and I don't want to mention there is a sport pack .Jenna .It's an additional $750 but that's gonna give you a little firmer tuning also lowers the ride height by 23 millimeters , and it gives you some sport seats as well if you were interested . But as far as the ride quality goes , I have had absolutely no issues . A4 definitely rides quite nice , especially on these somewhat punishing Pennsylvania roads with snow on them member and in places today .So no issues there cabin noise or lack thereof is also very nice . Not a whole lot of exterior when noise coming into the cabin . So that is definitely on point .And when it comes to visibility , this is the A4 . So what ? It's gonna have better visibility , letting us say that A5 sport back with them or fastback like design . So visibility's definitely very nice with the A4 , innit ? Don't also mention with that visibility is if you decided to go with the Prestige cuatro all wheel drive set up , you will get a head up display as well . So when it comes to forward visibility , Therefore , you're gonna be able to keep your eyes on the road much better , because it's gonna be illuminated onto your windshield . So you're gonna have that speed limit in the speed that you were currently going illuminated up there , so you can better keep your eyes on the road .But you know , for the driving dynamics , you guys , let's check out the exterior of this 2019 Audi A4 . It's there now , taking a look up front in the center . There you will find that Audi single frame front Grill with the Quattro designation .If you went that route to the sides , e non plus headlights with led daytime running lights will come standard , and it will actually come with the automatic feature as well , meaning When it starts to get dark out , the headlights will turn on automatically for you , so you don't have to worry about that . Led headlights will come with the premium plus trim level enough , so therefore , that is what you were looking at right now . Then make your way to the side . You will find power adjustable heated side mirrors with integrated turn signals looking down at the wheel set up , they will come sized up at 17 inches and there will be five spoke Hello wheels with a premium and then 18 inch double five spoke alloy is if you go with the premium plus or prestige , make your way to the back . You will find an integrated rear spoiler back there , along with led tail lights and rear fog lights just below them .And just below all of that , there is dual exhaust outlets with chrome tips . So you guys know what we have to do next .As always , here is that exhaust clip .It's no . But now , since we all around back to open that rear hatch , there is a button on the key . FOBs have simply press that if you like . But if you go with the premium plus trim level and up , it is actually a hands free trunk . So if your hands are full with groceries or other things , you don't actually have to take the key out of your pocket . Just get close enough to the trunk there , but once opened up , cargo capacity is gonna come in in an even 13 cubic feet and taking a look in the cargo area , you will find cargo tie down hooks along with grocery hooks as well and netting on the right side there . But if all of that was not enough space for you , there is a 40 2040 split , meaning the rear seats do fall down for quite a bit of extra space .If you needed it there , then make your way to the rear leg room that comes in at 35.7 inches . So for reference , I mean even six feet tall . This is how much base I have back there didn't .Also mentioned standard is three zone climate control . See , a driver and passenger can set their own temperature , but rear passengers is its own zones that they can set their own temperature back . There is well , that's definitely pretty nice . And , of course , where there's rear passengers back there , they will get an arm rest with cupholders as well , but they make your way to the front seats .Leather seating will come standard on every single trim level , and there will be eight way power adjustable front seats with power lumbar as well and heated for both driver and passenger taking a look at the steering wheel .It is tilt and telescoping . And again it will come leather after every single trim level .You know , when it comes to the startup , let me first start by showing you guys the key here you do of your lock Unlocking that button popped in rear hatch . And the key does have a heavier weight to it as well . So very high end key , if you will .But nonetheless , once inside , all you need to do is simply put your foot on the brake and press the engines . Start button , which is located just by the driver's , right neither and then once started up . If you were looking for that Audi virtual cockpit that is gonna come with the premium plus all wheel drive in up . And that is what we have today .So definitely an amazing gauge set up there and by the way , to control what is on that gauge set up since it is all digital . After all , there are steering wheel mounted controls on the left side there . So , of course , you have your tachometer and speedometer and a digital speedometer as well . You can also check out your average mpg . You could check out your radio settings or Perhaps my favorite part about that Audi virtual cockpit is the navigation you could check out up there . You can check it out in a smaller kind of screen . Or if you press the view button on the steering wheel there , that is going to illuminate the navigation across basically the full gauge set up up there . And that is what I love about Audi is virtual cockpit right there .But nonetheless , let's make our way to overall interior quality . Here .Homely controls will come standard for every single term level . So you got your garage door openers and being led interior lighting against standard across all trims as well as an auto dimming rearview mirror and a power sunroof is well again .This is all standard across everything there . But perhaps the first thing I noticed when I got in this particular A4 is the texturizing wood grain trim throughout this one , for instance , just to the right of the shifter , you got it there , but also on the doors , and it ties its way into just above the dash is well with the Quattro lettering , but anyways , this isn't Audi said the fit and finish is definitely on point .But now let's make our way to the tack display . There is a seven inch color touchscreen display that comes with the premium and premium plus . If you go with the prestige trim level , however , that will bump that screen size up to 8.3 inches against the color touchscreen . Either way , you will get Bluetooth in audio streaming , as well as android auto and apple carplay , meaning . If you have a smartphone , simply hook it up to the A4 nya free navigation up on that screen , as well as the ability like and dislike your Pandora songs up there . You can also check out , of course , your radio settings up there . And since I mentioned it when it comes to the sound system for the premium , you will get a 10 speaker Audi sound system for the premium plus in prestige . However , that will bump that sound system up to 19 speakers . There will be a banging Olfson sound system with 755 watts , and so I think you guys know what we have to do next .Let's turn on the radio . So we got playing this morning and less test out the clarity . This one base is reading Dick . You'll asshole A4 . You could definitely feel that . It's like massaging seats . Almost . It was so nice . But you have more than enough clarity . Basic . It is totally crazy .So absolutely no issues with the sound system here . But so the last thing on the tech display wouldn't mention is when you do put the A4 in reverse , you will find a rear view camera for every single trim level , letting you know who or what is behind you . And in addition to that , there is a top view camera . If you go with the prestige all wheel drive as well , so you could see what's in front of you into the sides . A swell if you wanted to , but either way , that is going to lead me into safety . So to start , there are front side . Inside . Curtain airbags in the back door is latched , decayed lower anchors and tether . Sir . Children for the rear car seats also back their rear child door locks . Tire pressure monitoring system will also come . Standard premium plus trim level is going to add Audi side assist with Audi presense rear , and the prestige is going to add Audi presense city and presense Basic . What that's going to do is help detect other vehicles and pedestrians . And it can also initiate emergency braking at speeds up the 50 miles per hour as well .And so But that is about it for this one . You guys , thank you so much for watching . We should have , like , the video and subscribe . Follow me on social media at the bottom of the screen there and I will see you guys in the next field . Stay gold ."
122,189,TT,"you need that sort of weighted steering . So you together get the apex perfect on public roads .Hello , ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to Supercars of London . And as you can see behind me , I have a brand new 2015 Audi t t . Now , firstly , I hope you guys enjoyed the block update that I provided with you yesterday which actually featured this car . But this is gonna be , um , or oven in that look on . First impressions and opinions are about the carved on the X1 have done the X3 . So I moved up to the TT one before the Audi R8 V 10 plus which I assume and hope is coming very , very soon . And the reason why I'm quite excited by this car's It's got the virtual cockpit , which is derived bit of technology that is going to be in the new Audi R8 v 10 plus . And I know it's another Audi . Andi , I seem to be doing a lot of videos recently without it , but it's all thanks to Watford Audi who are providing me with the access of cars which hopefully I'm gonna be able to explore a lot more with BMW . Maybe potentially many and a few other cars other than just Audi . But I'm tryingto sort of sharpened my tools in terms of being able to review cars so that when I've been given much more access tow vehicles , just Ferrari Lamborghini . When I turned 25 then hopefully oh , have a more refined review style car here , as you can see in 2015 Audi T two liter .It's not the Quattro system , As you'll see that is missing from the aggressive new front grill , which is more of a hexagon shape similar to the Lamborghini hurricane on . The new headlights are actually really quite cool . If you could see them , it's a nice specifications , this car . I wouldn't say it's the best one . It doesn't have the court system to . It doesn't have the extra gear box . These diamond cut wheels are actually quite nice , but I prefer the super multi spoke wheels and then from the side it still looks like a TT , and I know there's gonna be a lot of people out there that says it is still just tt hairdresser's car . But I think they're trying to go for a lot more of an aggressive look as opposed to the generic TT looked at everyone so familiar with . And the thing with this car is it looks so much better than the convertible . You'll probably know that I don't like convertible cars because it loses the shape of the car .It also sometimes you just lose the original rigidity of the handling .Another McClaren Z4 R8 slightly different with more a cop with this car . I think it looks all right .I think it looks pretty cool when I'm down in Winchester . I've driven down here , which you would have seen in the log earlier . However , now I'm gonna give you guys what it's like to drive first fashions insight into the new Audi TT .I'm gonna give you a lot of point of view on this because the virtual inside you can see the virtual cooked on because the engine is running on . Um , at the moment , we are Mayflower close , and you can change all of the views and stuff like that , which is showing a little bit . We've got the air con here . There's not much of a center console , a few buttons here , obviously missing something here . Not sure what that is traction off . No idea what a office Dr Select , which will go through . He's got a manual gearbox , which isn't the end of the world , but I'm up for the S tronic . And then here is where you do all the navigation which comes up here , which is very cool for the driver . Not so cool for the passenger who normally prefers to be the deejay . It's also safer .Um , and then we've also got out cantar inserts on the sports style seats , which is actually a really cool feature in the back . You got enough room for a rucksack , but I actually think , mmm , that is not really that much room for a person .So it's a manual car . It's the sort of electric parking senses . Quite weird . I didn't know how to turn it off , but you have to do is find the biting point , and then it works absolutely fine , and it works . Is every other manual car . There's nothing really I can talk about because it's not the extra money , but I have had the S tronic in the history on day are so good at what they do that every single Audi needs to be in their strong . I don't know why people still use their left leg and left hand to change gear . It just it just seems so agricultural when you can have a strong able like a said back in several guests . That's not the sound of the gear change , but the virtual cockpit .It's really quite cool . It just follows you around is kind of not having Google maps right there in front of you . Very , very easy to use . You don't have to take your eyes off and have a look at the sand , which is there or wherever it is . It's just really quite cool .But inside steering is quite like it's quite nice . Thio drive , turn the steering wheels and really nice field sort of mixture of materials that you get inside the steering wheel is one of the coolest places in the driver's seat is definitely call this place to sit .You don't want to be saying anywhere else in this car , definitely just driver's seat , which is , I suppose , the idea of making it more driver's car making you feel more involved in driving it .It's actually awesome power behind it .Well , so having the virtual cockpit is super cool . I haven't actually put in a destination for the SAT nav . I just like having the map up because it's a cool little feature .But the steering wheel is such an awesome thing . And I think that they've used pretty much the same design for the new Audi R8 V 10 plus , which is a really soft , stripped down , sleek , cool looking thing you've got .All of the dye was change the view here , which puts it back to you driving mode . And if you actually turn sat nav off , you get no sat , Never whatsoever . And you could just have music or radio or your phone , media , whatever .He's like that view that you get out of the wind . Mira is really cool . Quiet , aggressive looking shape on . You've also got this over me and Archie .Well , putting onto the motorway now you've got no problem with catching up with . The cars are just like putting my foot down . This is definitely a turbocharged engine . I have no idea , but it feels terrible . Charged . So many people are watching this . You go . How would you know that ? Turbo charged . Yeah , it's definitely I definitely understand that . My research guys , I apologized .We're pulling off the motorway now . We've had a good journey on the motorway .This place is a comfortable place to be .It's also very nice , luxurious , as you would expect from Audi .And now we're gonna take it off into the country ish roads . Just the A Rhodes A roads , the roads . That's right , Right ? Twisty ones . We could have a little bit of fun to see what this car like handling . Steering seems to stiffen up when you're under under a bit of loan , which is quite nice or touch in terms of when you're around town , you want the light steering because they're gonna be really fast . But then when you actually like driving properly , you need that sort of weighted steering Z8 together get the apex perfect on public roads .In this section of the video , we work out how wide this car is and how easy it is to drive down very narrow roads , lot narrow roads . And I was expecting , um Bob , this car is really fast . The problem that I'm having is towards the top end of the Reverend when so much of the power is there ? I'm really fine in the car becomes quite light of the front toe handle . I mean , I'm no technical genius or a driving expert , but even I can feel it , which makes me slightly on edge . If I was to put my foot down a lot , especially on these source of roads , it just feels like it's quite light and maybe the Quattro system Titi will have something that eradicates that basically driving down these country roads now it doesn't feel wind doesn't feel big time Obviously sitting higher than I'm used to and the Audi R8 This is the great thing about sorry roads .There are a lot of fun to drive down .One thing that I'm starting to realize the suspension on this car's quite wobbly . So I'm gonna try driver Select , put it in a different let's go individual .It definitely feels like it's going to it staring eyes definitely heavier .Oh , yeah , Definitely . The suspension here has vastly Sof stiffened up , which is great , especially on these roads . When you're having a bit of fun , I'm gonna Yeah , or the individual mode on the Audi is actually really good .Yeah , this come this car's a different car in different mode . I understand why there's a few different modes . This car is a lot of fun , so much fun that my body temperature has risen as the blood is pumping around on these country roads . Probably more nervous . The fact of how wide this car is , I'm used to my R8 , which is slightly wider .This car I've turned on the air conditioning , which is working fantastically coming from the left relatively bland center console .I haven't done traction control off because I don't wanna end up in a bush . But I think to be honest in this car , without the Quattro system , I'm relatively safe .But fingers crossed , I could get my hands on the new TTS very soon as soon as it registered registers with Warford Audi .But I think my favorite part of this car is definitely the virtual copy .I'm really looking forward to driving the Audi R8 the new one .Every 10 plus with this fantastic steering wheel was gonna have a few more buttons , especially the an antisocial button where you open up the exhaust systems .But that is it . Ladies and gentlemen , this is my first impressions video off the Audi TT from Watford Audi Thank you to the guys for allowing me to drive it for today . Have you enjoyed the past two videos ? Well , my flock yesterday updating you on the Super cars in London Channel , but also this video fingers crossed . In the near future , I'm gonna be able to start diversifying away from just Audi . I know there's a lot of Audi fans out there , but there's also a lot of other fans of other manufacturers as well . So fingers crossed , I could get my hands on some cars and start reviewing more cars , comparing them , trying to find out what cars are better than others on exciting things like that . But this is just the beginning of my journey . Talking about reviewing cars on . Hopefully I'm doing a good job of it . So thank you for watching . Make sure that you subscribe . I look forward to seeing you soon . There's gonna be tons of supercar content coming soon . Lots more idiots going car shopping In general , idiots do things . But that's it for now , guys , James . And I'll see you . See you take it"
123,190,A1,"What's up , guys ? Welcome to Supercars of London . As you can see , I am down in sulking , which is the southwest of England , on a family holiday over the Easter break . You may also have seen from social Media that , unfortunately , my Audi A one was involved in a little accident from Storm Katie , which is a storm that hit the U . K and unfortunately , a rotten tree crash down onto my car , but actually worse , the car behind , which is a VW Polo , which you will see . So the first bit of this video is just the first time that I saw my car under a tree or so with a tree on . Then we go on to the six month review off the nuke , which I filmed 24 hours previously to the tree landing on the car . So enjoy this video guys on . There's gonna be a Q and A coming up about daily drivers as my next video . So enjoy . That's no . Is that right ? Anyway , What's up , guys ? Welcome to see because of London and a video I'm not expecting to film because I'm filming on my iPhone . Whilst I woke up about 160 steps . Now , yesterday I went out and filmed with my Audi . I won the nuke . We filmed a pretty cool video talking about what it's like to live with . And I started on the stairs up here because we're down in the hotel . That doesn't have very good parking . So I had to park my car all the way at the top of the hill . Five minutes ago , I got tagged in a tweet from a TV news reporter saying , this car isn't going anywhere . Storm Katie has struck again .Holy crap !Oh , man , this is the extent to the damage . Poor VW Polo and also poor Audi A one . We've got a shattered Rhea window .We're so are my God ! Look at the tree . Holy shit ! I can swear that is what has come down . Oh , my God . So this is the scene .A man . I'm gonna have to get that fixed . New spoiler . That particular what these electrics are on . I've got it , doesn't there ? But apart from that , it's gonna be that's gonna have to come out . Um oh , What's up , guys ? Woke him . Two supercars of London in soak , um , which is the south of England were right on the coast . And if you follow me on Snapchat , Twitter and Instagram , you dissing some updates that I am down here with my family . This is a week's Easter holiday before all hell breaks loose . When I arrived back into London , pick up my new college . I've been working on behind the scenes on then me , Sam said . James and him are going on an epic Theo European drive . So today's video is going to be all about my 2015 Audi A one nicknamed the Nuke because off N . U K . At the end off the registration plate on the fact that I took it to dub customs less than six hours old and stealth the out . And there she is , at the top of the hill on top of silk Um , my Audi A one , which is nicknamed the Nuke . As I've mentioned Ondas , everyone probably knows I pick this car it from Watford Audi on the first of September and drove off the forecourt 10 minutes after midnight . So 10 minutes after legally being able to register this car , I drove it off the forecourt and then woke up at 6 a.m. To drive to dub customs , where they blacked out , stealth out and made it the real nuke on My Mom drives a 2004 Ford Focus on because I've come down with my girlfriend , my mom's sister and nephew know enough people could fit in that car . And plus , I wanted to drive myself . So myself and my girlfriend have come down in the Audi A one , and we've actually taken the majority of the luggage both my suitcase , my girlfriend suitcase on all of the food for the weak fitted in this car , which actually didn't do a good thing for the fuel economy , which I will get to you in a bit .So let's start with short distance town driving . What is this car like As a city car , it is designed for the nimble , tight city streets . And to begin with starting this car up . It is incredibly quiet . The engine run so smooth that you don't even feel like it's actually on a little bit like a Rolls Royce . I like to think when I drive this car on , then the Estrada gearbox is an absolute dream , with Hill assist is beautiful . It will start moving off .The steering is as light as you need it to be . The gearbox is as smooth as you ever wanted to be . On that is the great thing about driving this car around the town . I absolutely love it on dhe . This is why I picked this car to drive every single day . I put miles on it freely on dhe . It just does everything that I wanted Thio .Absolutely , perfectly . The visibility is very good , even with the tents that I got from dub Customs , which are legal because they're the real ones on the back ones .It is basically Black Edition Audi A one which I don't think is actually available from Audi .Now , when I'm driving around town , I tend to just drive in the efficiency setting because it's a start Stop . If I'm coasting , it also drops the rebs right down . So my fuel efficiency actually increases a hell of a lot , which is a really , really good benefit to this car . This car costs about �45 to fill up the fuel tank on that can get a range between 450 miles , which is very very good , but it can also get pretty bad . As I discovered on the way down here with all the luggage in the back when this car is very heavy .Little 1.4 engine that's struggling a little bit now being Audi smallest car , the Audi A one is incredibly nimble . Great turning circle on , driving these tight roads coming down into the silk in town centre . His car is just so easy to drive . You don't feel uncomfortable . We don't feel like going to clip a wing mirror . Kerber wheel This car being a small as it is is ideal for the city . And now I've just taken my foot off the brake . I'm coasting down in efficiency mode .Look at this . It is coping with roadworks , which you get anywhere in Britain . But we're not coming into the silk .Um , High street , which is incredibly tight on very easy to move around , even with people and dogs .One of the best advantages about this specific speck is these bad boys here , the paddles , the s tronic gearbox . On this car , I've always said Audi produce one of , if not the best gearboxes that I've driven the s tronic is just super lightning fast but also super smooth in this car as well . So driving around town , cruising , no need for finding a biting point with the clutch . It is just a dream makes this cost so easy to drive , and having this car is a daily on being stuck in a lot of traffic . This is just exactly what you want in a car .Let's move on to long distance road trips , because when I bought this car , I wanted tohave a daily vehicle that I could use . That meant that I wasn't going to be driving my Lamborghini every day because when I drove the Audi R8 is my daily . I lost that special feeling of driving it , and it did just become the norm for me . So I knew that when I wanted to buy the Lamborghini , I also needed to have a daily so that when I stepped in the Lamborghini , it was going to feel very , very special every single time . However , the one thing I did not foresee is the amount of long distance road trips that I go on in this car on , for example , so come this week is one of those examples 240 miles on UK roads . I've also been up north quite a lot of times on this car , surprisingly , is absolutely incredible on motorways with cross winds . Whatever the weather , this car is superb .I have driven the brand new smart car which feels a little bit wobbly . And when you're on the motorways and going over 60 miles an hour , however , this car , it actually has quite good fear . When you're driving on this road , it feels planted . It doesn't actually get affected too much by the weather around and driving at 70 75 miles an hour with whatever the weather . This car absolutely nails the long drives which I really wasn't expecting from this car . I didn't test drive this car before I bought it . I just kind of hoped for the best . And the smart car was for me , a car that was fantastic around the city , but pretty rubbish on the motorways . Where is this car ? It does both absolutely brilliantly on even just driving around these lovely coastal roads . It really grips the road quite well . I've got inefficiency , but once you put it in dynamic in the car Sol spices up a little bit . I can pad early up , go down the gears on this car , becomes a lot of fun . And I'll tell you what . One of my favorite journeys that I had was driving up to Lincoln , which is a lot of motorway miles on this car , handled it perfectly . The fuel economy was ridiculous , is about 60 mpg . But then as soon as we came off the road , we came into these tight , twisting roads . It was about 11 . 30 at night , so I had my headlights on .I could see all of the headlights coming towards me , and I just felt super safe on the road .And I just nailed it . And this car was so much fun in like , right now , A4 gaming for money is in the best gamer on Here we go , this car driving fast and driving hard on the source of road . It is like a mini go cop again .But body , this is This is what I've been going a bi polar that England scythe .Let's finally move on to the Audi Dr selected that you get within the Audi A one and this is something that I really wasn't expecting from this car because it is the base level . Smallest little Audi . They still put their drive selected on both A3 systems , but it doesn't make sense . All three systems make a huge difference to the card . I just wasn't expecting so efficiency mode basically cuts the engine . If you're coasting , it changes gear early . It probably uses less than the engine , meaning you get better mpg . So for the long distances , this car is perfect , and I have mentioned previously in this video that I do use it around town . Quiet , however , coming up to a junction coasting into a junction , which I do quite off it cuts the power on DDE has a little think about whether it wants to turn back on or not . So the only down side are saying to this car is blinis inefficiency mode . Driving into a junction , for example , you're cruising into a roundabout , and you're looking to the right to see if any cars coming . No cars are coming . The engine's already cut off , so you have to put your foot on the accelerator for a couple of seconds before it realizes that you want to engage the engine again , and that's when you get the power back . So there has been a few times that I've sort of being caught in limbo all around about gun . Where's the calyx ? The efficiency mode is very , very good , but I would probably stick to using it on long journeys soon . Did you pick into dynamic , which I have been doing already ? You could just feel the engine has just picked up . And then you know , the gear stick into sport mode it turns into manual on . Then you can have a load of fun with this car on .Even with the Great British spring , we're coming into spring anyway , with the weather being a little bit wet , roads a little bit went as well . This car becomes a little go cart on the way that just the weight of this car is . You're going around the corner .It's such a fun little thing , and I think the best way to summarize what this car is like to drive . It's a safe , small number one fast city car that looks fantastic .You get all of the features that you want from a car that costs �20,000 .I think Audi have nailed it . I think the new face lift on the A one with terrorizing the headlights make this car really , really futuristic up today . The old a one still looks fantastic . You've got there led lights . This car is a serious , serious daily on .I know that there's Tim out there with a Ferrari FF daily with engine bigger than the whole size of this car . But for what I wanted , this is absolutely perfect . Basically , around this video off , I might as well say that second video that is going to be coming from my family trip in silk , um is a Q and A about daily drivers . So you've got a question about this car . If you got a question about whether I'm gonna upgrade this car or what would be my perfect daily to sit alongside Whatever the lab beginning replacement is , then please let me know in the comment box below . I look forward to reading all of your comments and answering your questions in next video , which is gonna be a lot of fun . I'm basically just gonna go for a drive . I think I'm gonna flock drive back to walk within that drive in the log . I'm gonna be answering some of your questions or some of your most asked questions about Daily Driver . For now , I'm gonna continue enjoying this lovely weather that we're currently experiencing in silk . Um , it's just heavy showers all day with a little bit of sunshine here in there . So I've had a lot of fun actually driving this car and featuring it on my YouTube channel . If you want to Seymour off the Audi A one as well . Police come in below . What , you got any more questions than I look forward to answering them in the Q and A . I kind of got to keep my eyes on the right because this road is actually quite tight .

124,191,A1,"Good morning .What's up , guys ? Welcome to Supercars of London . How you doing ? I hope you've been enjoying the recent vlogs on the supercars on YouTube channel . Today I'm out and about in this car and over the weekend I put quite a lot of miles on this car driving up to Lincoln Ship . The Audi A one is a car that I didn't know too much about until I bought it . And then over the last two weeks , I've been putting some serious miles on this car and thoroughly enjoying it . So I want to take this opportunity today to talk about that in between running a few errands when I pick this car upon the first of September 2 days later , I went and picked up my dream supercar , the Lamborghini Gallardo LP , 5 60 So this car isn't feeling that loved . It needs a little bit more of a sense of stage on my YouTube channel . So I thought today I'll talk about this car in a little bit more details , so let's jump in . I don't want this video to come across as a review . A such because this is just a daily log and I'm in this car today , so I just wanna basically I'll show you around the interior of the car and show you how much leather you get on the Audi A one s line .It's a 1.4 liter petrol , and you've got this lovely leather stitched steering .Well , here , we've got lots of buttons here which are upside down at the moment . The astronaut gearbox here is absolutely fantastic with the pedals that you can see here .This is where you guys sit up there on all the way across is got semi leather seating has got fabric on the inserts on then leather all the way up the outside and again throughout the rear off the car .Now , when I got the Audi A one , I really did not know too much about the car . I didn't know what category it fitted in . Did it fit with the smart cars , the mini Cooper s cities that I've been driving recently as loan vehicles on dhe ? Do you know what I , um blown away by this guy's exceeded all of my expectations because of the size of it . I kind of put it in the same category as things like the fear 500E the smart car , those sorts of city daily drivers and the smart car that I drove was absolutely fantastic around town , dreadful on the motorways . And I didn't really know what to make of this car .Obviously , I've got quite used to the fit 500E The manual gearbox feels agricultural .Now , having this amazing s tronic gearbox in front of me driving this every single day is brilliant . I don't really put it in the block . So I want to put it in the logs today because trip up to Lincoln , which waas a lot more comfortable and better than I expected . It was all motorways and the A one which takes you all the way up north . Lots of lots of cool cars driving past BMW Enforce drove past couple of Ferrari's on this car really , really held the road a lot better than what I was expecting . The way that it sort of just sat planted on the road had maintained a really , really good speed . It didn't slow down when he didn't want it to slow down . I don't know . I'm probably rambling on a little bit , but exceeded all my expectations and the best bit about it was when I was in in the country roads , the single track road at night time . It's brilliant because you can see headlights coming toward you . And you know , when cars are coming your way out in Lincoln share , there's not many cars that come and you . So on the final part of the journey , I had a lot of final stuck this car in dynamic mode on just planting my foot on the floor on turned into a rally slash race driver on DDE . It was amazing . I wasn't expecting this Carter handle as well as it does . The box of Astra understood quite considerably . The smart car just had a very , very good turning circle . But if you start going into corners a little bit too fast , doesn't like it .It is time to get a move on . Today I'm very wearing that I might repeat myself from early Ron's . I went for a little drive earlier on and tried toe try to give my views on personally , looking back on it , not looking back on the content , but just remembering why I said I don't think it came across how I wanted it to come across just how good this car is , just purely because I wasn't expecting it to be as good as solid as well built . But also his performance strong as this car is , I'm now headed to SP Race Engineering because I'm pretty sure A8 e w would have sent the final samples of the supercars of London clothing T shirts ready A4 the launch at the end of this month , you may have seen on Instagram and Twitter that I posted the launch is coming soon . And you know what the time is ? Now is the time I've turned off the thing . I think the time's just past midday . I haven't edited yesterday's rock . So that is why I'm gonna be doing X3 race engineering today . I'm going there . I'm picking up the T shirts with samples R8 e w on . Then I'm gonna be editing yesterday's flog in the office . It is that time again editing back . That s B Rex Engineering . I got the old cameras up there . It's actually change place . And I parked my car next to Stuart's A4 to black out his next , which I will film it , but I need to get this filmed within 45 minutes . Then I'm back out in the Audi . I've got a meeting on then , depending on what time that meeting finishes . Depends on why do , for the rest of that money to pop down to Watford Audi as well . So I got lots of not so I need to get done . But this video is one of them . My main priority . It's nearly one o'clock . This video needs to be done on online by five Oh , ISS rating . Quick , quick , quick , quick , quick ! Uh ho ho , It's the worst type of rain is not have it is light rain drops that a heavy , heavy raindrops that the heaviest find , You know , you're gonna get wet but these ones just annoy you . They just tickle you all over . You know the ones I mean . Oh , no , it's not . Get a little bit heavier , but it is time to go to my meeting . I believe the weather was nice when I arrived . This is what I mean by the U K . Weather at the moment . It is so unpredictable and I have to traffic here . I'm done . Thank you .I'm gonna have to get the umbrella around when I bought this car came with an umbrella . So I have to get out Curry eating Skittles .And I feel like I'm driving up and down the same road all day today . But anyway , meeting them put my coat on Rain was very heavy trying to work out the way in which I was gonna phrase that Bob now the sun's out . So we've got the sun shining down on a very , very shiny road which is hurting my eyes . But I'm now going back to SP . So far , the 80 w package hasn't arrived yet , which is interesting because it will send yesterday . So I need to keep my eyes peeled for that . At the moment , the day's going pretty well . I need to convert my YouTube video on Uploaded to the Internet . The time is now three o'clock , so I've got around an hour to do that because I needed to be online and ready to go in time five o'clock . But I always want to be sure that nothing's gonna go wrong . So I always wanted to be live by 4 p.m. So my plan for the afternoon get this video online head overto what food ? Audi was gonna goto . No , I need to go toe to be very similarly impressed . Leaves again leasing it on DDE a few hours of being skipped . I apologize for what has Bean skipped . So I think the plan was that I was gonna Oh , yeah , I did . I upload the video has just gone live . The time is now . 10 past five on the video went online . So hopefully you've enjoyed that video . If you haven't , the link is in a description to what ? Yesterday's previous video . So I'm now heading home after an afternoon SP race Engineering . I did a lot of admin , actually . There wasn't too much exciting stuff that happened . It rained a little bit allowed c 63 1 part , But I actually left my video camera in the car . Bad , bad flogging technique that on now and I'm gonna get stuck in traffic . This is the first time that I've been stuck in this traffic in about two months . So at the end off SB road , there is a tiny little round about on dhe . This just gets built back from about half past four . But over the last two months , haven't really spent that much time sp race engineering . So I never get stuck in this traffic . Unfortunately , today I have left at 10 past five on dhe . I'm stuck in rush hour traffic . Thursday is looking great on on Thursday . I'm heading over to see Jonathan on Anna on Amelia and Eduardo the Cecconi Jolie's in the Lamborghini said that is going to be a fun vlog that's happening , But I think I'm gonna sign off now . Ladies and gentlemen , I hope you've enjoyed this video . I'm sorry . That hasn't been too much . That has gone on . Apart from the fact that I drove this car in the morning and tried telling you about how good it is . Please take my word for it is awesome . I just can't really get my words out today . I've really struggled and I've had to take a few takes . I've done a few takes s Oh , maybe I will leave some in the in the end bit so you can see how much I failed today . Maybe it's because I'm just a little bit tired . I don't know . Thanks for watching guys . As always , make sure you subscribe . If you're new . Andi , I will be seeing you tomorrow for another day . Vlog , including a one the Fiat 500 on potentially if the weather is good . The Lamborghini . So that'll be fun since more guys cheers .Good morning about how it is like to drive .I've learned it's a dump road . I would put it in sport here and see what happens if I put my foot down ."
125,192,TT RS,"today , Ron Rouble dripped on that 10 minute test drive were behind the wheel of the Audi TT RS . Very excited to drive this , and in the week we've been driving it , it's been amazing . Now there are a few things we need to talk about , both positive and negative for the General . Yeah , when this goes back tomorrow , it's not a good day . Way too much fun . So , overall , what do we think about it ? Is this something you should own and drive ? And by is it a good alternative to say , like a Porsche came in ? Or some other sporty car that's going to find out on this episode of Rumble strip dot net and 10 minute test drive ?So , believe it or not , take us a while to come to some conclusions on this Audi GT-R S8 not because it's bad , but mostly because it's good . But we have some questions about where it falls , and a lot of it has to do with pricing and functionality . So right off the bat regular TT Audi , Audi Sorry , the irregular Audi T T . It's a good vehicle . Tts better t trs . Yes , absolutely .When this thing pulled up in her driveway in this Michael Black all Yeah , seek your doctor for erections lasting more than four hours . That's not a superlative . It actually is . Really ? It just looked amazing . I still have the video of when it rolled in . That kind of like the initial reaction . Roll that in here for you . But man , it is like when it came , was delivered an effort , but detailed , all nicely polished and everything . I mean it it is . It is Vader's helmet . That's what this thing looks like . It looks wicked , mean , menacing , just absolutely badass .What ? I wanna own it in this color . No , I've owned black cars . I hate owning black cars . They're paying the and keep it clean . That's not saying . Doesn't look good and can Yeah , inside A . It's exactly what you'd expect from an Audi . The interior is very well done . The materials are excellent . Love the stitching in the seats . There's lots of carbon in here , which I could give or take the controls . Are you no good ?They're exactly kind of where you want them . One thing this does have , though , maybe does not have is a display right here in the center . that's gone . It's always nicely styled up here , and everything is here for the driver . Now . Is that a bad thing ? I don't know . It gets with everything stashed in the instrument cluster . And yes , this is the nice one with full led 12.3 inch led . Yeah , it's great , but there's just so much in there and tryingto all the controls that are integrated . I almost want some of that separated .Okay , it's it's It's only at the end of the week that I comfortable with where everything is and confined things , and it's just it's a bit much front center .The highlight of this vehicle is the two and 1/2 liter five cylinder in this in this vehicle in man . Does it sound like the glory days of glue Group B Rallying with Audi . I grew up , you know , in the in the eighties , watching groupie rally on ESPN . Yeah , I know it's a shock , is it ? But watching you , John Bottom and Michelle , Baton and Walter role and stick Bloomquist and you know and the like just rock and roll in the Audi Quattro and then the yes one and this being Quatro in this being a five cylinder with turbo back to those days . A little bit in this isn't anything like those vehicles , But , you know , you kind of get that little bit of nostalgia if you're awfully certain age .But the two and 1/2 liter five cylinder is 404 100 horsepower , and I want to say 3 54 3 64 on the torque . And it's good . Um , yeah , shove from about 2500 on up to Redline . Excellent . Um , Maggie ? No , not really . Just feels good . It doesn't , you know , like Big V8 torque immediately . No , but that's fine . It's a different character and kind of like it . Uh , we've done some , uh , some launches on this thing because it does have launch control and it'll pull almost a G off the hit . It's got some . It's got some pull and 334 100 feet . It's still pulling over half a G , about 6/10 of a G on . Then it kind of lets up a little bit . It's quick . 0 to 60 according to the factory , is 3.6 . I'd say that's probably about right . Let me throw wild card at you is something to think about . And this will probably annoy pretty much everyone , which is precisely the reason to make this point .Audi T T E R s or Nissan GT-R hear me out . Especially the earlier early GT-R is the 2000 eight's to about 11 . A4 hunt right around 400 horsepower and torque is in a similar area . This weighs about �500.4 to �500 . Last about $500 less . GT-R is in the �3800 range . This is a little over �3300 . All wheel drive . Yeah . Flappy paddles . Launch controls . This is probably a faster car than the GT-R . Now . J d m fanboy didn't want to hear about it .I think this looks better than a GT-R .It is more involving to drive than the GT-R because have driven a GT-R on a racetrack .And what this cost new And what you're gonna buy a GT-R for ? Used ? Absolutely . This would come out ahead . A new GT-R . Forget about it .This thing is Miles , at least on price and in performance is probably close enough .It makes no difference now . This is a two plus two .The back seats in this thing are a joke . I mean , they are a joke . There's you can get , uh , maybe a thin paperback book between the back of the front seat and the front of the bat and where your legs would go . I mean , it's no more than half a niche . It's a joke . So is there for insurance purposes only ? Uh , can you put anything back there ? You might be able to put a child seat back there . Tell her about two getting a minute out .The whole different issue , actually , not that bad , but you know , So this has different driver select modes that has , uh , individual comfort , dynamic and normal and comfort . It's actually not bad in Dynamic , which is where we spend most of time in its firm without being obnoxious , really wouldn't want it being any more firm than what it ISS put it into comfort . And it does soften it nicely , not overly .It's not overly soft , but it's a very comfortable ride , and that's really well done because the tires on this are a 30 section Siri's 20 inch tire stay there to 65 30 twenties , but felt annotate that if that's not correct , the side wall on it is literally three fingers . That's the sidewall .So the fact that the ride quality is that good with that little side wall in comfort mode , man Audi engineers , their suspension engineers deserve a pat on the back for making that happen .So the big boat in the room with the Audi TT RS is the price , not the base price , but more prices tested . And this has got the number of options and the men . Roni is in the trunk areas . I can't run down everything for it , but the base price is 65 roughly 65 5 Okay , that's not an unreasonable amount of money for this vehicle , especially performance level quality of materials , et cetera . No issues with that . But as tested with driver , performance pack and carbon trim and other bits and bobs on here , a role in a price rolling a picture that Maroni so you can see all the options here comes out to $80,000 . 80,000 and $200 . Now that is a stretch for this vehicle . Only because you are getting into say , use 9 11 territory and not very old . Use 9 11 territory like 23 like off two year , three year off lease 9 11 territory . And this compared to a 9 11 Well , it's 9 11 all day . Interestingly , enough in , Well , thank Peter de Lorenzo for pointing this out when he had this very particular vehicle about two months ago . Now , I guess it is , um he priced a Porsche Cayman s versus an Audi TT RS6 Audi TT rs and they pretty much track dollar for dollar when you start adding in the options and things like that and that's pretty interesting .So you have to ask yourself Audi T TRS or Porsche Cayman s . That's a much more difficult argument to have our different conversation to have , because different dynamics true mid engine sports car , this geek are sure is the caiman . A GT car can be no reason . It can't be , um , you know , cachet and a few of perceptions and other things like that . It starts to become an interesting conversation , right ? So , um , yeah , it's an interesting It's an interesting one to think about feel account of me on this .Uh , well , I know what the FDA says , what we're getting . I don't know , because again , we've said trying to find things in the instrument cluster . It's either not there or it's hiding really well . E rates it at 19 City 29 Highway 22 Combined short . Um , not unreasonable . It's fine . That feels , with the amount of driving and what it says , we have a range that feels about about right .I don't think you're buying this worrying too much about fuel economy , though , so but it handles while it dries well , it's very comfortable .The stereo system in here is good . It's the banging Olsen system . It's not the best piano system we've heard , but you put good quality music into it . And it sounds very nice streaming , you know , serious except radio sounds . It's okay , but you know , nothing to get too excited about .So overall Audi T trs Absolutely . This is It's a very , very compelling , compelling cock enjoyed it really don't want to see this one go back . We tried . We actually , I actually did call and see if I could stretch this for another couple days . But no , uh , that wasn't happening because , as you would imagine , in the local press fleet years in demand . So we put her miles on it . What we like to put more miles on it , Absolutely . But that's fine , pretty much the entire . This is like one day or partial part of a day .Actually , did rain earlier today pretty much the entire time we've had this vehicle . It's rained every day , and it does well in the rain . Traction control is great . No worries . It's a really good vehicle . I like it a lot . Is that half in R8 ? No . Is it a very fun car ?Enjoyable car . Reasonable value ? Yes , as long as you don't start getting ridiculous on your options list .Yeah , go on , drive this thing . It's It's every bit as good as everyone else says it is . And that's a very pleasant surprise for me , because half the time these things never live up to the hype . This one does . If you like what you see , give us a thumbs up . If you don't want to give us a thumbs up twice like that smash button and , uh , share , subscribe and we'll see you next time on rubble .

126,194,RS4,"Hello . Excuse me for one minute while I indulge myself just where I am two weeks on Christmas . I flew this morning to Malaga in southern Spain . Tow hop in the brand new Audi RS4 and the roads are phenomenal . What I didn't mention was when I left England , it was snowing anyway . Welcome a very special moment indeed . We are back with Audi . Now listen , this is totally unintentional . I know the channel has been very Audi heavy lately . It's just the way it's landed . Regardless , this is a big moment now A4 Audi fans and particularly for RS aficionados . The RS4 , I believe , has always had a very special place in Audi history . Now a little bit about the lineage and wise of old recently within now the themselves . I want you so far as to say that Cuatro has gone . But in days gone by , Cuatro was always the stamp off performance from Audi . But however , in recent years Audi has gone through somewhat of a rebrand , and now basically anything that comes out of Audi that is fast eyes under the name of Audi . Sports quarter , of course , still exists in its fantastic all wheel drive system . But this is now an Audi sport product on what's changed well , interestingly , power .It's still exactly the same . 444 brake horse power is in the outgoing , naturally aspirated V8 , which is odd . You might think that's strange . New car . Gin up the performance , However , on Bear with Me on this engine has actually downside . Now we shouldn't be too surprised that just because that's the way the world is going and die , Hi RS5 fans might be huffing and puffing and going . What is going on with the world , however , with the downsizing in engine capacity , is the upsizing in talk . And that is where turbo tech , really , where that twisting power that you get from talk is what we feel through our receptacles as a human , it's all about talk . That's what gives us that feeling of thrust when we mash our foot on the right hand pedal . So this car is actually up by �125 feet of tour , a very similar figure to its brake horsepower , is pushing out �443 feet of torque and 444 brake horsepower . Now that might not seem a great deal . But honestly , upon dropping a cog in this eight speed automatic gearbox will get on to that shortly . The talk is wonderful . I wouldn't say it's exactly organ bending , but the main thing is the Quattro system puts it down with the traction off a sticky J C B . It's like they're just gonna put superglue on some tracks and it's it to the asphalt . It's got so much traction . The great thing about downsizing and an engine in my eyes is mostly about downsizing the weight . So with two less cylinders smaller engine smaller . Wait .Now I haven't got the previous car fresh in my mind and freshen my field . But I do recall that car feeling a tad on the heavy side .Now I don't know if that's the witchcraft that they've done with this steering set up . It does feel very light with the whole car . It just dances . Just a lot nicer floats along the undulations off the road much better than the previous car Audi are telling me .Savings are out about 80 kilos over the previous generation car .Of course , we've got an entirely new chassis because it's based on the brand new A4 chassis , which , you know as a platform to base a car on is already brilliant . But now you're mating it to a Norris product .Yeah , I'm happy to records with the understeer that was ever so surveillance .He's a dick and the understeer nightmares of old appear . Let's just check out this left .It's all right . It's there , I think is there is a bit of a sort of safety net rather than just not being set up properly . Yeah , I mean , if you if you carry some breaking into the corner , it's planted . It is great . Of course . I mean , honestly , I'm driving this road fairly swift right now .We have to remember the platform were in as well . This thing has , you know , space for the family , a boot for D i y .And traction for snow . And here we are on this absolutely brilliant mountain road throwing it around the color on this car .Sonoma green . I would speck this . I would actually Spec It looks so good . I'm not sure the cameras doing it justice or not .Yeah , the understands . Fine , guys . I mean , that was a tight corner , but what I would say is carries and breaking in with it just to keep that weight on the front . If you accelerate a little too early . And I guess this applies to most cars , you are going to get the front end washout someone .But now it's that it's that tires . Now , for whatever reason , um , the new yor S4 is running Hankook tires Now . I've got nothing against hand cook , but it does seem an odd choice . I can't help but feel Hankook have done them quite a good deal to get the rubber on these rims . However , as you seen just then , you wouldn't want to be going much quicker than that . I can assure you on their great the bite is really nice , you know , tires . Ultimately , it doesn't matter what tech you've got in your car . It ultimately all goes through a piece of rubber that big on dhe . These handcuffs seem to be dealing with it beautifully .Okay , this is a bit of a sore point for me because if you watch this channel regularly , you'll know that I'm someone of a gearbox snow way . Our twin clutch in this I don't know why I just expected Audi because it's now this car falls under the Audi sports product category .I thought they might have put in something that was a little bit more of driver focused , however , Audi adopted with their eight speed auto as you've seen dealing with it very nicely indeed , it's not my preference , but ultimately 95% of the time , you're not gonna find yourself lucky enough to be on roads like this . I've gone very much out of my way to hunt down these magnificent , basically like Spanish Alps just to test out the dynamics off this car that gave oxidants if a beat I was very much on . It changed when I wanted to . It's not a razor sharp shift , but the number one thing . And this is what I care about the most . It changes down exactly when you want to change down . Now I haven't driven this car in the water at all , but I don't need thio . I know Audi Z8 Speed auto is beautifully for just daily ing around in automatic . I want to know what this thing is like when you put it into dynamic . Is it dynamic ? Isn't RS4 box Yes , it's It does hit the spot and importantly , Okay , it takes the box or down , changing exactly what you wanted to , but it doesn't quite have that super crisp slamming at home like you would do from your clutch . But then again , this isn't it . All right , it's and RS4 in smiles per gallon so far disproportionately high . You know , for me , a soon as you step out of the realms of a car . For practical reasons , smiles is massive , you know , having a good time and it being dynamically capable . So you can thread it through roads like this that might present themselves . Or , if you know , you might have a really boring drive home from work . When you have that one country road that you look forward to every morning and every evening , if that car helps you maximize the potential of any given road , your wedding , you know , and you've seen it firsthand . We just nailed that road . It was absolutely fantastic .Now aesthetics are subjective . However , my point is , this is the best looking RS4 yet , and I know opinions are opinions , but it's just so much more aggressive . Back at the hotel , they've got every generation of RS4 lined up this this car , the aesthetic of it just looks like they jumped two steps on rather than one . I think the evolution has been pretty gradual throughout the RS4 Siri's . But the DNA on this thing they injected a little bit of sharp looking , a lot more aggressive . I'm really thankful for for that . I think if you're buying into an RS4 odd Acct definitely wanted to suggest that the car is a little bit more aggressive . It's not for the pleasure of everyone else's eyeballs . It's for those moments at the end of the day or the supermarket car park or you look in the car and you walk away . You just take one last glance over your shoulder . That's when you know you're in something in a little bit tasty , and I'm finding that with this car , particularly in so no agree looks fantastic . But in the sun , the metallic flack is gorgeous . If they end up doing the net next RS6 available in Sonoma Green , I'm going Sonoma Green and Gold Wheels . Don't hold me to that , but probably now I know this goes without saying , but I think it would do this car disservice if we didn't talk about the interior quality , small touches for me . What I really like is that they've gone Audi exclusive on this particular car , and they've had matching green stitching to the Sonoma Green bodywork on the outside . I've noticed spending a lot more time recently . Yes , you'll know without their attention to detail is actually much higher than I think we give them credit for , particularly on their exclusive Siri's that the things they do , I'm not sure if you've seen on the seat belts off the R8 be 10 Spider .There's option tohave microphones stitched into the seat belt so that you could make a clear phone call when the roof is down . It's a really nice touch , something you probably wouldn't ever see if someone didn't point it out to you . But it's these little details . Audi are really starting to improve their game . And , yeah , I think it's something that if you're around any part Audi ease , keep an eye out for all of these little tweaks that just elevate above the standard car .So there we have it now because I was driving this car with enthusiasm . It's the whole time it has been in dynamic now . At times it has been a little bit stiff . But of course the beauty off Audi is . And I should say the beauty of RS products is you can go from raging dynamic , too pretty chilled comfort mode with literally flick off a switch . I absolutely love that about RS6 . It's like one moment you can attack this road like nobody's business . I refer to my RS6 as a tarmac terrorist that filters down away to this car . But the moment that I just want to chill , take in this sunset . There's a few cars that switch personalities as well as on our Escarre really appreciate that . Ultimately , it's very nice driving these cars on these fantastic roads , but back home when you just want a chair , then you stuck in traffic and you know you might be on the motorway night . Everything calms down the vows and the exhaust clothes and its tranquility . On that note , take this opportunity to sign off .There's always guys , thank you so much for watchingHello . Excuse me for one minute while I indulge myself just where I am two weeks on Christmas . I flew this morning to Malaga in southern Spain . Tow hop in the brand new Audi RS4 and the roads are phenomenal . What I didn't mention was when I left England , it was snowing anyway . Welcome a very special moment indeed . We are back with Audi . Now listen , this is totally unintentional . I know the channel has been very Audi heavy lately . It's just the way it's landed . Regardless , this is a big moment now A4 Audi fans and particularly for RS aficionados . The RS4 , I believe , has always had a very special place in Audi history . Now a little bit about the lineage and wise of old recently within now the themselves . I want you so far as to say that Cuatro has gone . But in days gone by , Cuatro was always the stamp off performance from Audi . But however , in recent years Audi has gone through somewhat of a rebrand , and now basically anything that comes out of Audi that is fast eyes under the name of Audi . Sports quarter , of course , still exists in its fantastic all wheel drive system . But this is now an Audi sport product on what's changed well , interestingly , power .It's still exactly the same . 444 brake horse power is in the outgoing , naturally aspirated V8 , which is odd . You might think that's strange . New car . Gin up the performance , However , on Bear with Me on this engine has actually downside . Now we shouldn't be too surprised that just because that's the way the world is going and die , Hi RS5 fans might be huffing and puffing and going . What is going on with the world , however , with the downsizing in engine capacity , is the upsizing in talk . And that is where turbo tech , really , where that twisting power that you get from talk is what we feel through our receptacles as a human , it's all about talk . That's what gives us that feeling of thrust when we mash our foot on the right hand pedal . So this car is actually up by �125 feet of tour , a very similar figure to its brake horsepower , is pushing out �443 feet of torque and 444 brake horsepower . Now that might not seem a great deal . But honestly , upon dropping a cog in this eight speed automatic gearbox will get on to that shortly . The talk is wonderful . I wouldn't say it's exactly organ bending , but the main thing is the Quattro system puts it down with the traction off a sticky J C B . It's like they're just gonna put superglue on some tracks and it's it to the asphalt . It's got so much traction . The great thing about downsizing and an engine in my eyes is mostly about downsizing the weight . So with two less cylinders smaller engine smaller . Wait .Now I haven't got the previous car fresh in my mind and freshen my field . But I do recall that car feeling a tad on the heavy side .Now I don't know if that's the witchcraft that they've done with this steering set up . It does feel very light with the whole car . It just dances . Just a lot nicer floats along the undulations off the road much better than the previous car Audi are telling me .Savings are out about 80 kilos over the previous generation car .Of course , we've got an entirely new chassis because it's based on the brand new A4 chassis , which , you know as a platform to base a car on is already brilliant . But now you're mating it to a Norris product .Yeah , I'm happy to records with the understeer that was ever so surveillance .He's a dick and the understeer nightmares of old appear . Let's just check out this left .It's all right . It's there , I think is there is a bit of a sort of safety net rather than just not being set up properly . Yeah , I mean , if you if you carry some breaking into the corner , it's planted . It is great . Of course . I mean , honestly , I'm driving this road fairly swift right now .We have to remember the platform were in as well . This thing has , you know , space for the family , a boot for D i y .And traction for snow . And here we are on this absolutely brilliant mountain road throwing it around the color on this car .Sonoma green . I would speck this . I would actually Spec It looks so good . I'm not sure the cameras doing it justice or not .Yeah , the understands . Fine , guys . I mean , that was a tight corner , but what I would say is carries and breaking in with it just to keep that weight on the front . If you accelerate a little too early . And I guess this applies to most cars , you are going to get the front end washout someone .But now it's that it's that tires . Now , for whatever reason , um , the new yor S4 is running Hankook tires Now . I've got nothing against hand cook , but it does seem an odd choice . I can't help but feel Hankook have done them quite a good deal to get the rubber on these rims . However , as you seen just then , you wouldn't want to be going much quicker than that . I can assure you on their great the bite is really nice , you know , tires . Ultimately , it doesn't matter what tech you've got in your car . It ultimately all goes through a piece of rubber that big on dhe . These handcuffs seem to be dealing with it beautifully .Okay , this is a bit of a sore point for me because if you watch this channel regularly , you'll know that I'm someone of a gearbox snow way . Our twin clutch in this I don't know why I just expected Audi because it's now this car falls under the Audi sports product category .I thought they might have put in something that was a little bit more of driver focused , however , Audi adopted with their eight speed auto as you've seen dealing with it very nicely indeed , it's not my preference , but ultimately 95% of the time , you're not gonna find yourself lucky enough to be on roads like this . I've gone very much out of my way to hunt down these magnificent , basically like Spanish Alps just to test out the dynamics off this car that gave oxidants if a beat I was very much on . It changed when I wanted to . It's not a razor sharp shift , but the number one thing . And this is what I care about the most . It changes down exactly when you want to change down . Now I haven't driven this car in the water at all , but I don't need thio . I know Audi Z8 Speed auto is beautifully for just daily ing around in automatic . I want to know what this thing is like when you put it into dynamic . Is it dynamic ? Isn't RS4 box Yes , it's It does hit the spot and importantly , Okay , it takes the box or down , changing exactly what you wanted to , but it doesn't quite have that super crisp slamming at home like you would do from your clutch . But then again , this isn't it . All right , it's and RS4 in smiles per gallon so far disproportionately high . You know , for me , a soon as you step out of the realms of a car . For practical reasons , smiles is massive , you know , having a good time and it being dynamically capable . So you can thread it through roads like this that might present themselves . Or , if you know , you might have a really boring drive home from work . When you have that one country road that you look forward to every morning and every evening , if that car helps you maximize the potential of any given road , your wedding , you know , and you've seen it firsthand . We just nailed that road . It was absolutely fantastic .Now aesthetics are subjective . However , my point is , this is the best looking RS4 yet , and I know opinions are opinions , but it's just so much more aggressive . Back at the hotel , they've got every generation of RS4 lined up this this car , the aesthetic of it just looks like they jumped two steps on rather than one . I think the evolution has been pretty gradual throughout the RS4 Siri's . But the DNA on this thing they injected a little bit of sharp looking , a lot more aggressive . I'm really thankful for for that . I think if you're buying into an RS4 odd Acct definitely wanted to suggest that the car is a little bit more aggressive . It's not for the pleasure of everyone else's eyeballs . It's for those moments at the end of the day or the supermarket car park or you look in the car and you walk away . You just take one last glance over your shoulder . That's when you know you're in something in a little bit tasty , and I'm finding that with this car , particularly in so no agree looks fantastic . But in the sun , the metallic flack is gorgeous . If they end up doing the net next RS6 available in Sonoma Green , I'm going Sonoma Green and Gold Wheels . Don't hold me to that , but probably now I know this goes without saying , but I think it would do this car disservice if we didn't talk about the interior quality , small touches for me . What I really like is that they've gone Audi exclusive on this particular car , and they've had matching green stitching to the Sonoma Green bodywork on the outside . I've noticed spending a lot more time recently . Yes , you'll know without their attention to detail is actually much higher than I think we give them credit for , particularly on their exclusive Siri's that the things they do , I'm not sure if you've seen on the seat belts off the R8 be 10 Spider .There's option tohave microphones stitched into the seat belt so that you could make a clear phone call when the roof is down . It's a really nice touch , something you probably wouldn't ever see if someone didn't point it out to you . But it's these little details . Audi are really starting to improve their game . And , yeah , I think it's something that if you're around any part Audi ease , keep an eye out for all of these little tweaks that just elevate above the standard car .So there we have it now because I was driving this car with enthusiasm . It's the whole time it has been in dynamic now . At times it has been a little bit stiff . But of course the beauty off Audi is . And I should say the beauty of RS products is you can go from raging dynamic , too pretty chilled comfort mode with literally flick off a switch . I absolutely love that about RS6 . It's like one moment you can attack this road like nobody's business . I refer to my RS6 as a tarmac terrorist that filters down away to this car . But the moment that I just want to chill , take in this sunset . There's a few cars that switch personalities as well as on our Escarre really appreciate that . Ultimately , it's very nice driving these cars on these fantastic roads , but back home when you just want a chair , then you stuck in traffic and you know you might be on the motorway night . Everything calms down the vows and the exhaust clothes and its tranquility . On that note , take this opportunity to sign off .There's always guys , thank you so much for watching"
127,196,R8,"Hello , guys . Welcome to Supercars of London and the first episode of Living With a Supercar . I thought that it's time that I bring you on my journey , come along with some of the adventures and find out what it's really like to own a car like the Audi R8 . So I thought that first episode should be my attempt , a full review of the V8 supercar . I'm going to attempt to relay my feelings and emotions I get when I drive the car . But also talking over a lot of details about the Audi R8 in this specific car at the moment is completely stopped . And , as you know , it's not going to stay stop , so it's best to do a full review right now . Let's go .As you guys know , I've never actually done a review of driving a car . I've always been in the passenger side , so this is the 1st 1 So bear with me . Don't go too hard from the comments and some of my stats , but what we have here is a 8 2057 Reg Audi R8 V8 .It's a 4.2 liter engine that propels his car from North to 60 in 4.6 seconds , and he's got a top speed of about 187 miles an hour . It's four wheel drive system , which is pretty similar to the Lamborghini Gallardo , as they're both the same sort of car , 70% to the rear and 30% of the front , which makes it quite fun in the wet talk about the dimensions of the car .What I'm used to it . The box Lastra . This is a lot wider , a lot lower , but pretty much the same length , Lamborghini said . That Top Gear said more like the Lamborghini Gallardo is the same length . There's a Ford focus .I'm pretty sure this isn't that far off , but , um , I have front and rear parking sensors which help me maneuver about tight spaces .But talking about like the ride height . A lot of people have asked me How good is it over speed ? But it's actually not bad , probably about that much . I don't really know in inches or anything like that . I'm not a stats man , but what I do know is about 75 inches wide S O . If you want to go on Google and convert that into meters , or however you want to understand it .You can do that , but after the end of this video , as we walk around , we've got the 18 inch , no . 19 inch double A5 spoked wheels with black brake calipers . I hope they get painted soon moving .We've got the silver metallic paint , so it's quite flaky in the sun . It looks awesome on then . Here we have probably the most expensive , I hope so extra on the Audi R8 from New . It's a carbon fibre side blades , no idea how much they are .I think they're in the region of about three and 1/2 �1000 .Check out some of the the engine nice and warm , and the things that you can differentiate between the Audi are R8 , V8 and V 10 .It's got four tail . Pope's not exhausts SP Race engineers corrected me on the fact that these tail parts and that exhausts R8 V 10 actually has two blades instead of four , and this whole back is in black and they're moving around . The 10 has different style wheels , as you've probably seen on the likes of me one fifties car , the side blades more aggressive . So this is the Audi R8 V8 from the outside .Let's head inside and we'll talk about some of the details of the interior inside the Audi R8 V8 .You sit quite low to the ground and probably about two and 1/2 3 feet off the ground . I level we've got the I don't even have a flat bottom steering wheel , and it's like full leather s . Oh , it's nice to have when your hands are like that , but it's quite it's quite weird and quite funny to get used to having the steering wheel with a flat bottom . We've got a hell of a lot of carbon all around here , which again is optional extras and then ahead of me .We've got We've got some controls that you can use to do the satnav or the music system . But the overall seating position of the car is actually very sent from the steering wheel is exactly where I would want it to be the pedals again , exactly where you want it to be . I've watched them reviews of top gear and things like that , saying that Lamborghini on dhe . Sometimes Ferrari don't get the driving position right , You've got your feet over there in Europe . But for the Audi , of course , is being German is absolutely perfect . And then if we start up , you have to put your foot on the clutch steering wheel in and you see the the dials go crazy for a bit , and it also goes red copyright issues with music on Dhere we go , Let's go for that .There you can see that we've got the SD cards . That's also where the satnav sits as well . Haven't I think I've even use that now ?So there's a lot of nice cool features before auto dimming lights , electric seats .We've got electric folding wing mirrors , not show of you will be able to see .But that's also quite call will and I'll be Parking in London on over was just a really , really nice spect car on . Obviously , when you start up , you get the big V8 grumble , so we'll go . Andi , take his car for a spin .So when you first move off from the Audi R8 again , you get the sense of how low you are to the ground . Obviously driving past parked cars , you're a lot lower than most that the car doesn't feel like a supercar . It doesn't feel very wide , doesn't feel very powerful . And you can really drive it very sedated and sort of poodle around town in it and get decent miles to the gallon .Which , of course , is always on my mind . Driving this car and gone from the box and Astro , it probably got about 500 miles to a tank , and it costs about 65 70 quid to fill up . Where is this ? I'll get about 300 miles to a tank , but it cost me 100 �4 you saw when I epically failed the first fuel stop . But you probably have to wait around 10 minutes before the oil of the engine warms up and you can really get this car going . But luckily , I've already warm the car up so we can go pretty much straight away talking about the sound of the V8 natural weather . You can hear it , but it's actually quite worry at the moment . The V8 is very , very quiet , and you can really get away with not making too much noise on creating too much attention to yourself , which is nice when you're obviously just looking to get from a to B , which of course , is car isn't the best car for doing , but it's still quite handy to do so . As we get out into the open road , I'll open up the exhaust systems a little bit just slightly and you'll be able Thio really solved here . The V8 sounds A8 .I didn't open the exhaust up too much , but what I did do was absolutely nail it to the floor . Didn't change gear until seven and 1/2 1000 revs which spoken up the exhaust on really gives it that epic epic V8 sound . Just I'll get addicted to it . I really get addicted Thio putting my foot down in this car because the great thing is about the Audi R8 V8 . A lot of a lot of people have said , Well , it's not really a supercar , but what I found when testing my first supercar with Premier Velocity with some of the cars that we tested like the 458 in the McClaren 12 see almost too fast for public roads .As you know , the 12 C actually gave me a headache in the 45 that it's so fast . But it's also so dangerous because you could lose your license like that . Where is this is manageable power ? We've got 420 brake horse power on , but it feels like I mean , I'm 23 years old . I've jumped up from a box astral 1.6 , and it didn't take me too long to get used to this sort of the power surge . Did you get in the car ? So we're doing two and 1/2 1000 revs now 30 miles an hour in third gear and just put put , Put my foot down . It just wants to go .The Audi R8 was created to be a rival to the Porsche 9 11 I think it's doing a great job because it looks absolutely brilliant .I love the looks of the Audi R8 . This car's six years old . No , but it still looks just as good as it did when it first came out , which is something that you can't say about some of the old washes .The sound , wise again , is absolutely pretty and like I just can't get away from the fact that you can drive this very , very slow speeds get away with it on . Open the taps when you want . I mean , there's a gap here , like 15 feet and each foot down , and it's just so much fun .So let's touch upon the handling of the Audi R8 and actually being behind the wheel of the full point to V8 my first impressions of actually driving it for the first time , which was after I bought it . Because , of course , I didn't test drive . It was that the steering wheel is really quite heavy , and at low speeds it takes a lot of getting used to . It is almost having the Vauxhall Astra , which is in 2007 which obviously had power steering this sort of films like I'm going back in time a bit and it doesn't have power steering way . We've got some nice turns and the brilliant thing about cars . Obviously it's built for speed cornering and just just hugs the corners like it's not even trying . Which is probably the best thing about driving a car that's so low to the ground has such fat ties so much power driving the box Astro . The tires are probably half the week , so when you're going around the corner like you feel like you're gonna topple over like a bus or something like that . But like driving , driving around like with the traction on . Obviously it really , really hugs the road . And it is a real pleasure to drive . Just coming around to this . Are you better now ? And I'm just , like , got one hand on the steering wheel and I'm not really trying . I took that turn it like this .Oh , my house in my mouth . There that fan was in . She's in my wing mirror . Oh , my God !But its handling wise , as much as the steering wheel is quite heavy . It gives you that sense of being connected to the road and actually being in control of the car . Where is some of the other cars that I've bean in or have heard about in ? Reviews have got quite like steering will . My girlfriend's car is a fear 500E Andi , built for the city on the steering wheel is like bouncing on air bubbles . It's that light . So just trying to try and avoid this pothole . We got a bit of a tunnel .There we go . There's the brakes , walk the hell we've come to an impromptu car boot sale or something like that , and I just I don't really know what's going on . What realizing that we're videoing what's going on ? No idea . But we're getting quite a lot of looks for um , interrupting , I think , is the word .It's so fun , So fun .Thio drive like this , We're coming into a nice little quiet road . So I think this is probably a nice place to summarize and what it's actually like to drive the Audi R8 and sort of finish off my first ever reviewed . So this car is off as much as I've seen it and read about that . The fact that it's built for speed it's built for driving perfection is very hard to read those words or tow , watch it on a video and no actually experience . It's the only thing that I could probably say is definitely try and go out and drive a car like this . Whether it's on the track , whoever you hire one or you say YouTube , channel up and be able t o buy one .It's definitely definitely worth your while Thio get behind the wheel of even the R8 V8 like a lot of people yes , have said that it's no riel supercar because it doesn't do 200 miles an hour . It doesn't do naught to 60 in three seconds . But really on UK roads , you're , um you don't need any more than this . Has got a brilliant amount of power .The handling is just perfect , like you saw on those roads so easy to drive only 23 years old . And luckily , thank God someone out there has ensured me to drive this car . Live my dream on DDE .Enjoy this car . And I hope that I could bring a lot of enjoyment to everyone else on YouTube Following the living with the supercar journey also supercars of London's and make sure that you subscribe share . Andi joined my journey and get involved in Hopefully one day you can jump in the passenger seat with me . If you see me , just say hi . Andi asked for a ride . Don't mind given anyone a ride , so just pay petrol . These guys"
128,198,A1,"wait .Welcome back to Super Carriage option on today . Guys own back in Belgium ours after a long , long time since our last visit . I think it's Bean . Just over a year . Last time I came here , I was in a film oven Audi A one or an M to four years . It has been quite a while . Obviously . It's time returning with my Audi s one on . I've actually come up here to talk to you guys about the first month of ownership of the Audi X1 since it's actually being over a month . As a matter of fact , it's never been six weeks , which has completely flown by Andi . I can't believe I've still got this car . Nevertheless , to this day still , I have the Audi X1 . I fully enjoyed it . There is nothing I would ever put against the ish Just such a magnificent car . I do also believe it's actually better than Audi . Yes , very well , Felice , I have driven and Audi s free javelin Audi X1 .The one thing that would make it a little bit more special is the estimate gearbox . But I'm not gonna hold that against it because it is the full special field .The Audi X1 is powered by 2 204 to break up our semi four wheel drive , a k . How Lex Quattro system petrol , obviously quite exhausted on the back , is such is not really in , you know , it's a no , it's acceptable sounding car . It could sound better . A lot of people do modify these cars , another friend to sound super to them . I think it's all right for me .For now , I've nearly put about 2000 miles can already . Yes , I've been driving a lot has come out some expense . I have put more money into this car with lust . Well , I say the last month . So if I just give you the most for the update , even though it's just simply over .I've been driving it much for the last seven days in the way . So really this still for a day or so in terms of the car itself , um , averaging about 30 mpg a k . I've actually been about two miles . It's not coming out correctly , but I have to report nearly �500 of a few in this car already . If we want to ask what fuel I put a lot of people recommend Shelvey power . However , I am not driving this car to its full limits on driving it , you know , lost here a blast there . So I think it's perfectly happy on that Momentum 99 which is good as well , because test Elemental 99 is obviously a high octane fuel on .It's not that expensive , which is good for me because you know how much I've actually put in the car . And last month I will be stopping to drive it as much now because I'm sorr Gates the fact that this is now Micah , I'm not want to drive it every five seconds , but yeah , �500 in the last month .So that's just one of the insights digging again , although we'll say when the efficiency movies on is actually okay says that's going to get if it is going to get 100 miles of range . If you drive it , it's gonna get 100 miles of range as well .Is that if you drive with cruise control ? Well , if you have a very light foot on the motorway , this car is incredibly good on the motorway . I was of the trip from Harrogate to Leeds on the motorway , which is a about 30 mile round trip . Well , sorry enough for my trip , and I lost 10 miles . Arrange . Awesome , obviously . Then I put it back into dynamic mode and then blast around the city center on that , pull the rage down to about average of what I should have really got , which is extra foot miles arrange book . But it just to feel you get that , we'll say officials will just feel very blunt . The carvers feel very slept . Well , I think efficiency mode does . Is it just Something taps into the sea you and puts it until I could lower ream up stage for that's what it doesn't that make you just a full force for brutal setting of the car automatic . I've never really used that before . You know , we were gonna be wanting to drive a car nice and hard . Also , Wanna be saving fuel one of the two .Unless we want to maintenance . Right . Then this car hasn't being , you know , had any problems are such accepting the fact that I've already had to put one tire and the car was a continental comfy spot . Contact A5 that was 100 �50 which I had to put on within three weeks of own car tire pot . You know , I think so , Yeah , That was the reason I was so expensive because it was a Sunday and everything was closed . So charges apply now that one is actually getting client wants . So that's also the new ones that means of active enough to put to you constantly spot contact five on the cabin . The first move .So that's the privilege of any of these cars .You got to put premium tires after the back to I think they're probably run you because there's nowhere on them at all . Memorable , you guys A4 of the statistics of the Audi A8 . Well , what about doing itself ? Everybody's different , is very body . Doesn't grab as much as May ever doesn't get a flat tire on when it's in a long time in the 1st 3 days . That's just how it is to me .One last thing . I think we should actually do it with the Audi S4 . Marlys in this video is made up . What ? We're in building malls . Why not take it for Dr , uh , Ryan ?I mean , the first thing you should know about this car is just got so much talk . Still got forged nucleus for a hot box along the car of Small is this is cool because the fact is you're in a small car but with high power , honestly , a really count . Compete with just how much power this car's got is absolutely sounds . Well , it sounds Bullet is the same engine as the Audi . It's free . It just sounds so similar .Okay , I think so . Sound Turbo South is absolutely It just sounds said . It actually sounds stopping . They are terrible and always offic . It's time again .It's just insane . I absolutely had it all .It's just a little . I just A4 nothing on any could zero ? It's faster than this . I'm always saying that because if you want any faster than this car composed a proper professional race car driving . Driving into the you'll be driving to dangerously cool . If you guys listen to this here , so wash this red efficiency foot down .Oh my God , I can't I cannot just company what this car has got . It's just such an awesome engine . The engine is super reliable . It's just this road is 50 way Go to 50 . That Look how quick that was . Absolutely say incredible .It was incredible . Scenery captured Only got one camera can show you guys this car just hold It just looks that way .Notes mention Audi is free everywhere . But as we discussed video last year at the most stolen kind UK don't give That still applies today But oh , my called It's just absolutely say I do well , so that when you put your foot down , you just crossed the everything you just drop .Yeah , you just It's just not gonna feel when you feel down . But oh , so best bet there was a question because it suits you down . No wheel spin .Go on . I do treat this kind of like a supercar . Now we've hit this . I'm not willing to really put my foot down . I'm sorry . It's just not gonna happen . This road is actually really cool . Well , this was such that also wrote to go , but if it just being a skid risk . Yeah , I just got a little pebbles .Well , I'm not having that Get up on the paperwork on this card to the little people really treated walks . It every week . That's how I roll around in his car . But the window down thanks to this , stop by for a little bit just here .I will say one thing about this car is quite surprising people , and that was two types of quadrille . Sorry , this isn't even really 1/4 . It's like it's how like system , Which means the majority of time . The calories front wheel drive , way kick in when needed Wouldn't need me when they can't lose control . But what it does that A7 50% of power . I think it sends up to 70% . Because this car kid , you know has Bean Mr along . It really is a handful . If V8 sees off , that's what causes the tides of over .It just sounds insane .The exhaust oh isn't great , but the engine's sound perfection in the body count for me . I just Yeah , true . Exhausted isn't great .It's and Audi , please don't know . We've being such a sad ass , but I'm not wrong . Insane Nixon . Now , this is just a special way this carriage pulled together .It doesn't need to sound insane to be off . If you want to buy an insane sounding Audi , you look into the I . R s range .This couch is just maybe it's why I say it's a completely different to the out when it may look .Some of the interior is attracted to say , but you know , to drive .This is far from Audi able guys .Thanks for watching , not seeing next video .wait .Welcome back to Super Carriage option on today . Guys own back in Belgium ours after a long , long time since our last visit . I think it's Bean . Just over a year . Last time I came here , I was in a film oven Audi A one or an M to four years . It has been quite a while . Obviously . It's time returning with my Audi s one on . I've actually come up here to talk to you guys about the first month of ownership of the Audi X1 since it's actually being over a month . As a matter of fact , it's never been six weeks , which has completely flown by Andi . I can't believe I've still got this car . Nevertheless , to this day still , I have the Audi X1 . I fully enjoyed it . There is nothing I would ever put against the ish Just such a magnificent car . I do also believe it's actually better than Audi . Yes , very well , Felice , I have driven and Audi s free javelin Audi X1 .The one thing that would make it a little bit more special is the estimate gearbox . But I'm not gonna hold that against it because it is the full special field .The Audi X1 is powered by 2 204 to break up our semi four wheel drive , a k . How Lex Quattro system petrol , obviously quite exhausted on the back , is such is not really in , you know , it's a no , it's acceptable sounding car . It could sound better . A lot of people do modify these cars , another friend to sound super to them . I think it's all right for me .For now , I've nearly put about 2000 miles can already . Yes , I've been driving a lot has come out some expense . I have put more money into this car with lust . Well , I say the last month . So if I just give you the most for the update , even though it's just simply over .I've been driving it much for the last seven days in the way . So really this still for a day or so in terms of the car itself , um , averaging about 30 mpg a k . I've actually been about two miles . It's not coming out correctly , but I have to report nearly �500 of a few in this car already . If we want to ask what fuel I put a lot of people recommend Shelvey power . However , I am not driving this car to its full limits on driving it , you know , lost here a blast there . So I think it's perfectly happy on that Momentum 99 which is good as well , because test Elemental 99 is obviously a high octane fuel on .It's not that expensive , which is good for me because you know how much I've actually put in the car . And last month I will be stopping to drive it as much now because I'm sorr Gates the fact that this is now Micah , I'm not want to drive it every five seconds , but yeah , �500 in the last month .So that's just one of the insights digging again , although we'll say when the efficiency movies on is actually okay says that's going to get if it is going to get 100 miles of range . If you drive it , it's gonna get 100 miles of range as well .Is that if you drive with cruise control ? Well , if you have a very light foot on the motorway , this car is incredibly good on the motorway . I was of the trip from Harrogate to Leeds on the motorway , which is a about 30 mile round trip . Well , sorry enough for my trip , and I lost 10 miles . Arrange . Awesome , obviously . Then I put it back into dynamic mode and then blast around the city center on that , pull the rage down to about average of what I should have really got , which is extra foot miles arrange book . But it just to feel you get that , we'll say officials will just feel very blunt . The carvers feel very slept . Well , I think efficiency mode does . Is it just Something taps into the sea you and puts it until I could lower ream up stage for that's what it doesn't that make you just a full force for brutal setting of the car automatic . I've never really used that before . You know , we were gonna be wanting to drive a car nice and hard . Also , Wanna be saving fuel one of the two .Unless we want to maintenance . Right . Then this car hasn't being , you know , had any problems are such accepting the fact that I've already had to put one tire and the car was a continental comfy spot . Contact A5 that was 100 �50 which I had to put on within three weeks of own car tire pot . You know , I think so , Yeah , That was the reason I was so expensive because it was a Sunday and everything was closed . So charges apply now that one is actually getting client wants . So that's also the new ones that means of active enough to put to you constantly spot contact five on the cabin . The first move .So that's the privilege of any of these cars .You got to put premium tires after the back to I think they're probably run you because there's nowhere on them at all . Memorable , you guys A4 of the statistics of the Audi A8 . Well , what about doing itself ? Everybody's different , is very body . Doesn't grab as much as May ever doesn't get a flat tire on when it's in a long time in the 1st 3 days . That's just how it is to me .One last thing . I think we should actually do it with the Audi S4 . Marlys in this video is made up . What ? We're in building malls . Why not take it for Dr , uh , Ryan ?I mean , the first thing you should know about this car is just got so much talk . Still got forged nucleus for a hot box along the car of Small is this is cool because the fact is you're in a small car but with high power , honestly , a really count . Compete with just how much power this car's got is absolutely sounds . Well , it sounds Bullet is the same engine as the Audi . It's free . It just sounds so similar .Okay , I think so . Sound Turbo South is absolutely It just sounds said . It actually sounds stopping . They are terrible and always offic . It's time again .It's just insane . I absolutely had it all .It's just a little . I just A4 nothing on any could zero ? It's faster than this . I'm always saying that because if you want any faster than this car composed a proper professional race car driving . Driving into the you'll be driving to dangerously cool . If you guys listen to this here , so wash this red efficiency foot down .Oh my God , I can't I cannot just company what this car has got . It's just such an awesome engine . The engine is super reliable . It's just this road is 50 way Go to 50 . That Look how quick that was . Absolutely say incredible .It was incredible . Scenery captured Only got one camera can show you guys this car just hold It just looks that way .Notes mention Audi is free everywhere . But as we discussed video last year at the most stolen kind UK don't give That still applies today But oh , my called It's just absolutely say I do well , so that when you put your foot down , you just crossed the everything you just drop .Yeah , you just It's just not gonna feel when you feel down . But oh , so best bet there was a question because it suits you down . No wheel spin .Go on . I do treat this kind of like a supercar . Now we've hit this . I'm not willing to really put my foot down . I'm sorry . It's just not gonna happen . This road is actually really cool . Well , this was such that also wrote to go , but if it just being a skid risk . Yeah , I just got a little pebbles .Well , I'm not having that Get up on the paperwork on this card to the little people really treated walks . It every week . That's how I roll around in his car . But the window down thanks to this , stop by for a little bit just here .I will say one thing about this car is quite surprising people , and that was two types of quadrille . Sorry , this isn't even really 1/4 . It's like it's how like system , Which means the majority of time . The calories front wheel drive , way kick in when needed Wouldn't need me when they can't lose control . But what it does that A7 50% of power . I think it sends up to 70% . Because this car kid , you know has Bean Mr along . It really is a handful . If V8 sees off , that's what causes the tides of over .It just sounds insane .The exhaust oh isn't great , but the engine's sound perfection in the body count for me . I just Yeah , true . Exhausted isn't great .It's and Audi , please don't know . We've being such a sad ass , but I'm not wrong . Insane Nixon . Now , this is just a special way this carriage pulled together .It doesn't need to sound insane to be off . If you want to buy an insane sounding Audi , you look into the I . R s range .This couch is just maybe it's why I say it's a completely different to the out when it may look .Some of the interior is attracted to say , but you know , to drive .This is far from Audi able guys .Thanks for watching , not seeing next video ."
129,199,A8,"Hello , guys . Welcome back to Super Cars . Yorkshire on what I'm gonna call it is probably very emotional video for me , to be honest with you because , well , it's to celebrate one year with my Audi A8 won't But I want to speak in something else in the big which makes this kind of emotional . But yeah , I picked up the Audi A war less line a year ago . I say , a year ago , it was actually the 22nd 20 23rd of May when I picked the idea When I I'm filming this on the 18th off . May on this thing is going live on the 19th of May . So realistically , it's nearly year . However , I have not got another opportunity . Thio makes video before I actually pick up my car . Because tomorrow which is the Friday I much ahead enough to France for the very first time to see lemons , which is obviously not the 24 hour race with Kyrie stuff . Don't you gotta be kidding me right now , never ending trade . I don't know why I seem to come in . I think I come here because it was quiet . But I say it's quiet every five minutes . Is a train coming past ? Yes . So I'm basically do it one year view of the Audi A one s line . So we've got guys , Let's get into very special only one to chase that feeling again .Let's be friends .You only need what's best for you , not I way way loving and hating on silver screens Believing everything we come to see you go outside I didn't feel so way Just see everything we wait I want to well , show every guy's What I've actually done to the Audi once is I picked it up .I do love them Re alights so much .Obviously I've not done anything mechanical lies because well , I'm just not to show on the act like a say in the space of the label in this video .So I have basically done to the Audi one is this black stripe , which I thinking whether we do it soon because they didn't use proper rapid fire , which was a mistake . You see the sign that shrink really glue . Obviously the roof has been done twice recently . Redone . Uh , come down here . We've got the black spot . DB9 summer , obviously the block vinyl wrap on the back of the boot . But that was not the first . That was . A lot of people think the graphics act on the car . It was actually the Audi low . But some people think that come of the island , there's no we did that . I put them on more or less about five days after I picked up the car . Then after that , about three months , two stripes , then the spoiler , then the roof . I don't sit in the back of the car . That's all I've really done to the Audi wound , maybe the registration , But I don't think that really counts .So what ? How have I been able to live with this car for over a year ? Well , I'm going to go inside the out there , which I haven't done for a long time . First off to excuse the monster and then he drinks . I do need to have them a lot .So yeah , inside the idea one . It's a truly spectacular place to be . I still stand by that one year on . I've got a little bit bored of the current style , but that happens with any cowards now . R8 Lamborghini . Everything just eventually S4 occurring to you . But overall , it's a very decent interior . Everything has a nice feel to it . So I cannot complain .I probably would say the other thing is obviously the space in the back .Obviously , I I'm the driver , so that does not apply to me . So the interior of the car basically suits me very well . Especially for my age .Oh , I know that sound from anywhere . Is that what I think it is ?Yes , it is .Train .You got a slight hatred for Trey's right now over .Although I think my idea one did look good , but I just think slightly improved . Obviously . I'm no writer because of our rights . The counter means slammed and had all sorts of stuff . You know , where they were , simply got walk a few graphics . Is there anything else I want to do to the Audi A8 ? Well , with generation A4 left , um , I'm probably gonna say the only thing I'm interesting doing . The only thing the only thing I'm probably interested in doing is sticking . So many people know that they know I'm here . The only thing I'm interesting do into the Audi and one is sticking on s line right there . because it suits on Danny's Audi on this line , and I think mine lease on really suddenly got to . It's like badgers , obviously when the side as well . So I think one of the fellas really lights up . I think so , yeah , basically , I want to do to the Audi one .Do I still love the Audi able ? Of course I do . If I hated the idea , it would have probably gone back ages ago . Now completely I've taken care of , I said . But the 30 17 inch ally wheels also boobs swell , just just the car itself . I cannot get over how cool this car is . After a year of owning it , I've become a full on Audi driver .Ultimately , though , this car I just cut again of the journey front of it as well . Come on .Yeah , so 12 month review of the Audi will race . It's just basically relative it . He's doing fine and actually process lt recently . We've no advisory , so just proves how cool these cows out . Really just well made is destined that I have a supercar . Some point , probably . Yeah , because I'm unless flippers have a not so good house on the very very good car over Samuel in 19 . So I'm not gonna lie . I'm beginning my thesis bite out of the house or no , but I do think next this is the thing that I'm going toe . This is the emotional part of video . I do think that my next car is gonna be a big step up . Compared to the Audi A world , it's not going to be anything exotic by far standards . But for me , it will be especially for my age .I just love this cow itself . You know , I cannot actually get over . How cool is it such ? Anyway , this is the best way you guys might wanna start listening properly . So basically , I've been looking into a new car . I know the Audi want us features so many videos of people moving by . I've had it for years now . And as much as I love this car , it would be so epic to move on . I would hate to give it back because I absolutely love it , but I'm gonna have to move on way I'm gonna have to next year anyway . Book . I am potentially the position right now . Thio . Great to a new car and in a second , I'm not going to reveal which car .I'm actually interested in buying this particular carrying question . I had no chance of getting insurance policy on any time before now , because I don't like one years . No claims on Booth . See , I live in and the car , but I want to take out . He's obviously not the cheapest to ensure it , actually , what they actually wanted �5000 for me to take on insurance balls with one years . No claims , however , the insurance polls . I am well received , if you like for the Cal , I'm interested . Take it out . It's still high , Um , but it's actually affordable . It's within my budget if I want to get a new car .The engine specifications of the Audi one . That's one point for tear S8 manual 125 R8 calls Power . So that's okay . Um , so what's with the collar ? I want a great next capsule has 211 brake horsepower , which is near enough to , well , 100 . More like 90 more . It's also got the S Tronic Gables jiving would be a pleasure to have on my next car because I've heard good things treat beat to me then yet so , too . And it's also two leads , by the way . Too early to 211 brake holds power . A car with an instrument gearbox would make it , well , fast . Really rapid .Anyway , the car in question that I'm actually considering getting next . It's kind of cool because of its price , because it's actually surprisingly cheap .It's a 61 play Audi T t mark to s line Black condition .I know it's a big step up , but it's within budget , for its price .Is mileage is below this car's Yeah , it's extremely gay books 211 brake horsepower That will make Billy and I actually was thinking two days ago , and I actually changed my mind because I probably wasn't in a position to do so , but actually may have come to an opportunity Where I will be able to get this car is a such So I will do is realistically payoff . The Audi A8 trade it in , and yet the new car could be rivers are not sure when . Now I cannot guarantee on when the carries actually coming probably won't be for a least a month , put it that way , it could potentially come in summer . That's if it's still available . I can't do it right now because off . So I'm going to France tomorrow , so I really can't do it . But when I get back in the little kids with a little bit more and see if I could actually realistically afford to come my age and if I can believe me is I'm gonna do it because I had the Audi alone for just about yet . I have the same at me for just over a year , so it makes sense to a great a year on . I'm supposed to keep this car for another year . Yeah , I mean , I happily would . There's nothing on this car all . I mean , people know me by , but I do believe in upgrade will be appropriate because it's not ludicrous me to go for a TT . But for my age , it would be , in a way , an Audi TT 211 brake horsepower s lime black addition astral IQ . Well , to me , that will be like super car . So with that , guys , please based in mind , I'm not actually fully son when this could happen , but if it is gonna happen . I haven't confirmed this yet . This is just a fort . And it's a very , very important for that I've had on more or less an important announcement . But if I decide to go for this car , it will be brilliant . Take into account that I could the county and one could be replaced soon , especially after only for just over just about a year . Let me know your force on the Audi TT mark to s line Black edition with 200 brake horsepower . Two litre s tronic Do let me know about that because I'm I'm also did it for myself . But it will be great to , uh , share the experience of you guys . Obviously do . A full on collection video and everything with all this guys . Thanks for watching . If you actually watched to this point , I'm We want to see you The next video . CheersHello , guys . Welcome back to Super Cars .

130,201,A3,"you might think that a company that named its cars after different sized sheets of paper lacks a bit of imagination . Take a look at the new Audi A3 , which is remarkably similar to the previous car , and you may start to agree . But just because Audi is playing safe with the styling , that doesn't mean it's latest . Three Door Hatch isn't an innovative machine . It follows the firm's ultra lightweight design ethos and promises a double whammy of improved performance and economy . That's pretty much the pitch of its archrival , the BMW one Siri's . So this A3 is going to have to be something really special if it wants to steal sales for its fellow German .Prices start at just over �19,000 for a rather basic SC spec .1.4 version . If you want the range topping 1.8 T F s I in S Line spec .Expect to pay more than �26,000 .But if you look carefully , you'll notice the chubby Audi Grill framed by led daytime running lights on the sharp creases along the sides of the car that run from the headlights to the tail lights .He's given a more macho chisel look okay , so it may not look that different on the outside , but it's the things you can't see on the new A3 that are really important . Around 80 kilograms has been shaved off the weight of this car by swapping steel for aluminium at the front end on by cutting the weight of other components under the skin .That diet is really good news for drivers . It translated some pretty athletic prowess . The 1.8 T sign car we're driving dispenses with the North 60 dash in just over seven .We've yet to put the A3 through our comprehensive fuel economy tests , but Audi claims the new engines will achieve between 50 and 69 mpg . That's an average of 12% lower than the old A3 , the new chef .XC60 Audi A street well balanced , really good to drive on winding roads on the quarter . A4 will drive system in . This ensures it'll stick to the road like this .Two gearboxes are offered a six speed manual . A7 be best running Later in 2012 Audi will introduce an eco friendly one point sixties . This will have CT admissions of 99 grounds will qualify for free car tax . A4 Hatch lovers will be really pleased to hear that a powerful S version is promised further ahead . While City might be interested in the electric pastry .The A3 is cabin is upto Audi as usual impeccable standards . There's a lot of soft touch plastics , a good feeling steering wheel and these events that seem to have been borrowed from the Audi TT up for mm , I touch and you can write the address you want to get to onto the screen one letter at a time . The satnav should then recognize the word on set your course . If this seems too much work , you could just use a system with voice control with a larger wheel based on .Before this , A3 gives front and back seat passengers a bit more headroom .Boot space increases to from 3 52 365 liters . That's enough for two reasonably sized suitcases .The new Audi A3 is much more than a clean sheet of paper . Under its conservatively styled skin is a superbly well engineered car . It's more agile and faster than before . Whether it's good enough to be class leader remains to be seen . But one thing's for sure . The new A3 is definitely going to give BMW and other rivals a real run for their money ."

133,205,S4,"All right . Welcome back , guys . Um , so I had a video for a while . I have to mean it . You got something record on the phone . 10 . You got company . I with me on the phone . You don't like me alone ? Files on tip computer . So I have just such a way to get a phone call . Him is now No , a back wall as well , because it's night phone A8 pulses time . And that's well before don't wear about cameras . I'm definitely gonna get one soon .A4 channel real . I don't want to be get it . I use it on a daily basis for all the things because I'm not getting a lot of attention on . And so I'd like to be a bit more attention before I start spending money . Um , this video is just gonna be about 5000 miles . May Audi R8 springs up just four days ago .A5 1009 miles .So yeah , we'll do a video , Hopefully a little . Most field gets violent . You know what it's like a 55,000 miles . Yeah . A3 opinion changed on it .Well , get into separate points in this video about what has got better . Maybe what I think still , I don't like about too much . Maybe , but overall , it's most most . So we'll start with about things .No , really , about most things is what you expect . Anyway . From now on , it's free .Mostly like before . Attention . Yet sometimes quite negative People start to decide if people start front Front body point , a second point of fuel .Everyone knows Audi A3 . Some people fuck guys just fussing a little bit more fuel in May . So live it like getting away on about these old feelings . S4 may . It's quite quite a bit compared to why you want 60 resting . So yeah , overall , I've been doing about 17 . My holster going on . I have been driving first tell a quiet most of the time . Usual . I feel by dropping down here , put your foot down , breaking drop it down gets a all the time All I have a new sucking over parts of a button I never stole from below .Another point about its advantages . It is really hard to think of it because I got nothing .Most of a baby guys quite steep .People don't mind for me .Way obviously expects all these things you buy , you think about what you're going before you buy it .So far , another point is about the oil I have been told , and I'm aware from over videos of these cars tend to use quite a lot of oil and run new . I didn't think you were gonna use as much as it did about for 9000 7 miles , kind of cattle area , um , needed filling up . So when I walk on the road , Well , I came on the night to go to a nurse Audi dealership because I had no idea what we're doing .Uh , when I went to the Audi deal , she would watch the Harry get one tell call , but they are calling a red line specialist cars . And if you watch all the big YouTubers , you're so going there and very good . I was closest Deal powers . What loves the light came on social straight . In case I didn't do any damage to the car . So what ? R8 get Neil ships that I should've got a free ball Just so I picked up a lot of free balling .So how about a free ball in the boot ? I won't wait . Paul spoke never wrong .Whitefield A3 Balsa wood Phil being with him . S8 bones . It's upto of a point yesterday and finds out tell you about which one .The tired fishermen . It's came up , so I lost pressure . May front , right ?Tire tire pressure indicate no money , no car . Tell us tells me , Walt Precious in each tile wants perfect pressure .Another negative things like this up . But you can't get around him so above it . It's not Major Shen . Apart from laughing at the end of a native S4 powers positives .So 5000 miles in You can't be here loud . Uh , definitely sounds bad for a few miles on it . But what I would say he's definitely running . Don't S4 .Well , maybe my break .Whoever says it , especially the 1st 1000 miles , the best trying to fire definitely no sounds . Well ,"
134,207,S3,"Hello , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome to Supercars of London . Now , today is gonna be slightly different is not going to be a super car . And if you follow me on Twitter and Instagram , then you have seen the car that I've bean lent today , which I'm really excited about driving . But this video also is the perfect excuse and perfect opportunity for me to say This is why I need a second YouTube child that doesn't have the super cars in London name . That is all about what I get up to because today what food Audi have lent me the brand new Audi S3 Saloon car , which is a 297 brake horsepower twin turbo to leader pocket Rocket .Andi , I've had the joy of driving it down to Winchester today , which I'm really excited about and check out the beautiful metallic blue paint 19 inch wheels on around the back gets a lot more expressive , expressive , aggressive with the sun in my eyes .It's obvious that this isn't a supercar , but I also have been toying with the idea of having a hot hatch that I can run alongside my main car that will be featured on the main supercars London YouTube channel . So I'd like to thank Watford Audi . Their instagram page is in the description below and is appears now for you guys to check them out because they've gone awesome array of stock on their only five minutes away from me . So they're also my local Audi dealership and I enjoy going down there and check it out . What cars they've got at the moment I got really cool RS6 . I'm waiting until they've got the r S7 because I absolutely love that . But for now I have got the s three saloon which rivals the new to Siri's from BMW Andi to me , I much prefer this and I can't wait . Thio drive it and show you guys . What is this car is all about so inside and sat in the driver's seat .You've got a really quite a simple center console here , but it's all stitched with awesome leather . You've got the X3 logo here . You get the S tronic gearbox down here . I don't know whether you can see that you've got the whole center command here .This thing pops up which becomes satin of radio and all that sort of stuff .And then from the driver's seat , the points of view you get , you get the flat bottom steering wheel , which is the same in my car . But this is obviously a lot more refreshed . It looks quite similar to what is in the current Audi R8 .Not sure what they're gonna do for the new one , which comes out of Geneva , and I'll talk about that soon on .Then you've got the S8 tronic paddles here , the six speed gearbox , which is pretty brutal , actually .Andi super quick .So this video is gonna be my first impressions of what it's like to drive talk to you a little bit about some of its performance . That's Andi . Yeah , this is quite an exciting opportunity for me . So and hopefully after this video , I'll be able Thio , get driving a few more bits and pieces and not just my R8 . As much as I love driving the Audi R8 , it's good to have a bit of diversity . So this car So for Dre Shin of this video , you're gonna be sat up there on the reason why I sat up there is it would become a parent . I normally put you around here in my car . But as I squeeze the break to start it up , I'm gonna have to turn the music off straight away . I think that's what put quick .There you go . You can see the satin out , so I mean , unless you want to see the back of the sudden Avalon . If I'm putting the cover there , you're set over there .So to start this car up , you have to put your foot on the brake .There's only two pedals in this car , which is the break in the accelerator .Turn the key and there we go on . But the moment I am park so take the electorate .The parking brake off on . Then you grab me now and you click back on the gear . Stick on dragon all the way forward to D and s , which is Dr Take your foot off the brake and you begin to lurch forward .Yeah , So marching forward Onda , we are awaiting drives like an automatic .And you know what ?When you first drive off , this car is incredibly comfortable .It's quiet and it's sort of really , really understated . It's only when you put your foot down on the accelerator that you actually realize that this car , stupidly quick nor to 16 just under five seconds , which is the same sort of North S60 time , is a Ferrari 360 from 1999 this car has got the same soft power . It's a Ferrari for 15 years on . Uh , yeah , it's quick from the factory said that it was 420 break . But like I said , experts save it . Never actually is 420 when it leaves the factories and the more around the 400 market , because mine's a little bit older from 2008 . So it is a lot harder if in this car it may have lost a few horses as well , which means that this car is probably on power . The exoneration off my Audi are right here , in fact , is that you're seeing a lot higher .It's a lot more comfortable on , but when you look around it , it just feels like a normal family car . You could get for four people in the back . You could definitely get four people in the car , just four people in the back of this . It's a really tight squeeze , and people seeing on each other's laps , but it's quite a lot of space . Actually , I didn't look , I didn't look behind . Gonna turn left on idea .Right ? So we've got a really nice sunny day on a Tuesday . I'm driving this really , really cool .Audi s A3 Cupid , stupid north of 60 times for this sort of car costs �35,000 which may doesn't seem like a lot of money when you've got the Ferrari sort performance or performers oven Audi R8 in this car and it's got a limiter of 155 miles an hour .And I was only on the Audi Web site the other day . Looking at RS6 is and you can actually pay toe have the speed limit limiter moved up to 176 which is pretty cool feature .So I wonder what this car will do if you did the restricted . But I am at all condemning the idea of the restricting cars and trying to work out its top speed , especially on public roads . But I know that it's possible to do that .But today I'm going to be driving down to win just out where I went to University . I've got a few meetings down there on it gives a good opportunity to stretch this car's legs . Find out what it's like on the motorway . Find out what it's like off the motorway on . Just try and get an all round good first impression of this car . I'm gonna be doing quite a lot more miles than I did in the Lamborghini in the Esther Martin that I drove not so long ago . So I'm hoping that I could get a much more well rounded impression on this car that I can then relay back to you about my first impressions of this car . I'm also flogging the day , which I think has already gone out before on this video .So I don't know what I'm talking about , that so I'll shut up my foot down turbo boost style that you get in the bottom right hand corner of the Rev .Limit is one of the corners things I've ever seen . It looks really futuristic . It's got lots of metal . Finishing is , and things like that looks really cool .And as you put if you're cruising along and you put your foot down , you can just see the boost bar like going up and then kicks in a snapshot neck off , which is something that he won in a family saloon . Cars just about to say hatchback but the X3 hatchback . He's a hatchback .This is the estrogen saloon on it apparently weighs 40 kilograms heavier , then the hatch back on .What you get for two kilograms is essentially a boot , but they've managed to engineer .And so it is only like , nor 20.1 normal two seconds slower . S60 . Then the hatchback , which is actually I'm heading back .Thio , now back to Watford Audi be giving this car back . Unfortunately , a CZ you'd have seen in my frog , which is appeared a couple of days before this . I have running out of battery on my video camera , and I'd like Thio confirm in advance that a new battery has been ordered for my video cameras . I made a film a lot more , but I hope you guys have enjoyed the song . First impressions . First taste of first drive review off Audi X3 Saloon is an absolutely fantastic car . I'm gonna cruise back now in complete comfort .I gotta cruise back now in complete comfort . Andi , just enjoy the rest of my time with this car .Hopefully there's gonna be a lot more exciting cars on the way . I'm gonna be given the keys to more cause . So there's gonna be a whole variety of cars coming to supercars London Channel and also my own personal channel when that gets launched , and at the moment , I don't know , But please subscribe . Please share . If you like this . If we wonder if one of your friends is thinking about getting this car , share it to them , I'll tell them myself . This is an awesome car . Get it ? So there you go . Thank you guys on . Do I look forward to seeing you very , very soon in a car that I have no idea what it's going to be ? Probably my R8 , but we'll have to wait and see . So thanks , guys . Easy ."

136,210,RS6,"welcome back to the Audi RS6 performance . Now I look back on previous videos to see when was the last time that I featured RS6 on channel . Turns out it was February February . What's going on ? I can't believe it . I mean , because I drive the car so often , I guess to me it feels fresh , but I couldn't believe it . So the last time I drove the car on the channel was actually comparing it with the Porsche Panamera sports charisma . Which kind of nicely brings me onto the future off this car on the future of that space in itself . What I mean by that space is this sort of super estate cars . Now , when this car launched from this generation off , the RS6 launch was still kind of the only riel proposition in with super estate market's . In a long time since BMW had an M version , often estate car yes , while Mercedes-Benz have the E 63 the way that the space has evolved since this car has launched a competition simply didn't exist . And so I want to talk about the future of this car , how it's going to sit in the coming months on this channel what might be replacing it ? Annals of discussion off the space in general . Now there's been something about the super estate market , which has become fascinating off late now . The previous video to this it was actually me driving the Ferrari G T . C . Four loose . So the B 12 version previously to that drivel V8 . While I guess strictly and technically that is more of a hot patch because it is a hatchback format , I do think it's fundamental . Platform does land itself smack bagging competition with cars like this , despite the fact that the GTC A4 luso , particularly V 12 version , is an additional �200,000 on top of the price of this car .When I drove it , I'm blown away predominantly by . I'm sure regular viewers of this channel know the words about to come out of my mouth but provisionally blown away by the gearbox and the relationship of that gearbox with that wonderful V 12 engine . It was like driving A4 Sita 12 which I mean really , in terms of exciting with practical cars . Where do you go from there ? A four seater half 12 . That's a sense of what it is with four wheel drives , a genuine years , a practical car .Having said that , an element of practicality was stripped out of it because it waas a two door . It is like I said , more off a hot hatch sort of compromised on the complete practicality by making it in two door coupe A8 . However , nothing beats practicality like a general around four door car . Now this and the Panamera Sport Charisma , which is a product that did not exist when this car launched . These two for me still sits at the top off the chain in terms off super steak on super practical wagons . Now I guess as well . At the same time , A product which also didn't exist at that time was Mercedes-Benz 63 4 Matic . Now that car , I had the luxury of driving actually around a circuit . I drove around Silverstone , and that was the mess version . The East 63 S8 A4 matting . That's a four wheel drive E 63 AMG again four wheel drive Am . Jeez , when this girl on did not exist in the estate car market , is that all of a sudden where this car used to rain champion there are now all of these other brands of platforms encroaching on its format . The interesting thing for me is that because Porsche , Volkswagen , Audi , that part of the same group , I'm questioning where the future of this car lies . There's always used to be at the top off superstate cars , but now they have the Panamera sport charisma . Now to clarify that there's a Panamera , there's a Panamera sport . Tourism of the sport . Charisma is basically what I would classify as Porsche's RS6 on why it's concerning May . But because they're inherently from the same group and a similar family , I'm wondering if the next RS6 which I believe will be launching or at least announce next year 2019 . Will the HVAC group allow the Audi RS6 successor to be better ? When I say better , I'd be more powerful than the Porsche equivalent . It's probably unlikely , right ? I mean , the Porsche for a very well suspect sport sure is mo You're looking at least the turbo .You're looking around about �130,000 which is vast coin .Do not get me wrong . Will they push the RS6 that far ? I'm not sure . Now the rumors I picked up on and please accept these as purely rumors . I have nothing tangible of which to back this up , but I'm hearing and hoping that there's gonna be two model variations of the RS6 when it launches on .And I've also heard that it will maintain a V8 engine which when you drive this thing , you'll be very happy now . The generation before this , it was actually a twin turbo charged V 10 engine , as in the V 10 engine that was in the Lamborghini Gallardo and later on the R8 10 . Now they managed to twin turbocharged that car , making incredible . It sounded fantastic .It was incredibly faster when this car launched and it was downsized to the V8 you know , pure . It's tow an enthusiast over the RS6 that time will I want you go get rid of the V 10 . That's such a shame .But when you drive this , it's such a more sophisticated and it's got fantastic talk . Wonderful power in the driveability and usability of it is superior to the old V 10 even though on paper it's sound quite as exotic .And I think history is kind of repeating itself because if you look at cars like the RS5 .They downsized the engine , but the performance is still there . Now the rumor is coming back full circle to the beginning . Off this topic the rumors that they're still gonna maintain twin turbocharged V8 , which is now found in the lap of yours . Which is , I believe , the fastest SUV out there s O . If they maintain that , that would be fantastic . But what else is on the radar ? Which excites me greatly is the notion that there might be a second option of the same car which will be a hybrid RS6 .Now , once again , do not hold me to this . This is just rumors and chance that I've picked up on my various travels around the wonderful cars . But the video before this excited me at the prospect of replacing this with a low mileage pre owns gtc Z4 Luso Sometime next year . The aim of the game is that this car will probably get replaced next year sometime . But I really wanna wait for the replacement of this car to be announced .And if they do a hybrid version , imagine the talk . Imagine the talk of this thing . I mean , already pulls like a mule on crack , but with a hybrid bolted onto as well . Now , if you think about it , that former actually already exists in the Panamera they share very similar to Dr Strength .Speaking of Dry Train , What I hope is gonna come next is potentially an upgraded gearbox now , when the car launched and I've always been somewhat of a gearbox snob . But from a practical car point of you have been able to live with the fact that this isn't a jewel clutch gearbox , even though it's incredibly quick . Most of the time , I'm not grabbing it by the scruff of its neck and driving in 20th . I am using it as a daily practical driver , but it is wonderful to have that power on the braking performance when you needed this one . It was optioned with the optional carbon ceramic brakes . But things have evolved and twin clutch gearbox is becoming more commonplace in high performance cars . And this is why I want to draw parallels between the Panamera sport charisma from essentially the same group that runs a fantastic Jule clutch gearbox . In fact , the best gay box in the world as far as I'm concerned is the portal Pini K . It is an audible tone . Change off cog maneuvers . Honestly , it's It's so Seaver's is so fantastic . When I drove this car last on this channel , back to back with the Panamera Sport charisma , that was one off the things which was highlighted . The most waas sophistication leap off the Porsche gearbox over this . This is a conventional A8 speed talk converter box , generally okay , but when you're really on it , particularly under heavy braking and downshifting , it's not always there for you . Portia have recently made that PPK gearbox with a car I've also driven recently , which arguably kind of encroaches on this space as well , which is the new Bentley Continental GT .They managed to fit that gearbox to a W 12 twin turbocharged engine . Now that just shows how far the evolution off the Vedic A8 gearbox has come to be able to deal with that much talk . Twin clutch gearbox is an engineering marvel on what I'm hoping is . Well , that's everyone hope , but everyone writes Audi and go look , can you just dip in the group pool and fit one of those fantastic gearboxes to the next RS6 because I are feeling these guys are gonna have to pull every trick out of the bag in order to keep up with competition . And the gearbox for me will be one of those things . Meeting it with a hybrid drive train maintaining that twin turbocharged V8 . We're looking at 650I horsepower . I mean , that's also this thing . This is the performance model . No doubt they will be doing an evolution off the new RS6 halfway through its life cycle , the performance version basically up to the power of this car to 605 brake horsepower out of the factory stock .Serious pope for something with five seats and a boot big enough for , well , life generally .Now imagine if they stuck on a hybrid system .Twin clutch gearbox , four wheel drive on for me personally , the aesthetics still off the RS6 , even though it's getting a little bit long in the tooth Now , I think the front of this car is still the meanest in its category . When I parked it next to the Panamera Sport Ritmo from the outside , I just felt that portion looked my soft . Considering its power , it looks off , but this next to it is a very brutish cars up such a fantastic stance to it .Now , halfway through my ownership cycle off this car , I also great in the exhaust . Portia haven't necessarily got the best sounding turbocharged cars right now . This come pops and bangs on the overrun from factory were wonderful , but we upgraded to Audi smooth .It is important to talk about Audi Z4 part because Audi , rather than building that hole performance exhaust , they teamed up with one of the world's leading exhaust providers . Crap of it . Just so happened to make the exhaust for there race cars , so they've got a great synergy there already . Significance off . It is often times when you put on an aftermarket .Exhausted can sometimes invalidate the warranty on your car because this exhaust was developed in conjunction with a crab , a bitch and Audi warranty is maintained .You have it fitted at Audi , and that's exactly what I did for May . I just drew out a whole new lease of life from this car . Not that I was getting bored of it at all , but it just enhanced it . Every time you downshift like this and you hear those pumps of banks , which are glorious . You are reminded that you are in something quite special , and I'm hoping that they're able to do that on the car next time . So yes , what I'm talking about right now . What ?I love your predictions , thoughts and feedback on , as always , is what do you think the future of this car should be Now ? I've just done over 31,000 miles . I do use it a lot and has mentioned the last time you guys saw it was February . So it has had a lot of lifespan to work on a load more miles up until now . I'm so happy with it , and over 30,000 miles it's began to free up a bit .The way that the engine schools up , it feels lighter , less friction internally . It's just bedded in him because I've run in from day one from view . I know that this engine is now sweetened . Sounded has been incredibly reliable .The only problem I've had has been a cracked windscreen , and that is that .Is it everything else about this guy has not skipped a beat , and so 30,000 miles to me feels like I'm just getting started so far . Fantastic . But I'm very excited for the future off this planet . The R S lineage from Audi has developed this cult . Following this cult status has such a strong , passionate user base and fan base . This cars with one of the most popular cars on this channel . I don't know what it is , but it has universal mass appeal . I think it's because it takes so many boxes . I'm not aware off any car that takes quite as many boxes . This GT-R three isn't far off , but , of course , in terms of practicality come anywhere near this car's A5 seats .It's ridiculous .Big boot , four wheel drive , super usable ends . On top of all of that , it's really , really fast , like really fast and together with carbon ceramic brakes .I also upgraded the ties to mention it . Part of sports twos on here are wonderful . It's changed the whole grip level versus the ties .It came with stock , but everything has a complete package . Honestly , think people ask me this a long time . If you have one cup , this car is up there . It's so hard to signal . So right now , this video really is about discussing the future off this platform . The future of this car , this specific cards to this channel on what might come next . Now , I'd love to hear from you guys . Is the one of the superstate you would like to see on ? The channels are bearing in mind . This won't be replaced until next year , so it's not going just yet . But I still want to plan and hear your thoughts on it because ultimately this channel exists because of you guys . I want to know . Well , you would like to see it go . Would you like to see this stay for much , much longer . Would you like to see a feature on the channel More often ? I think that kind of goes without saying I can't believe this last February . I'm actually sorry about that . Like that's That's not cool , because I know you guys enjoy this car , as do I . But ultimately , one day we'll go . The time frame is next year . Sometime , even though I don't know what the lead time will be on an order slot on the new RS6 , they might announce it , and again , I don't know this for fact , but they might announce this car out of Geneva next year , which is March time , and then it'll probably be six , maybe eight months , the time until it actually turns up . So it could be this time next year or even later , that the new RS6 human shows itself so way . Still got plenty of time to enjoy it . Share with you guys former off this car , so comments below . There's some big things coming on the channel over the next few weeks . One of them , I can't believe it's actually happening , and I can't wait to share with you . These do stay tuned like comment and subscribe , and , as always , thanks for watching . I should see you next time .welcome back to the Audi RS6 performance . Now I look back on previous videos to see when was the last time that I featured RS6 on channel . Turns out it was February February . What's going on ? I can't believe it . I mean , because I drive the car so often , I guess to me it feels fresh , but I couldn't believe it . So the last time I drove the car on the channel was actually comparing it with the Porsche Panamera sports charisma . Which kind of nicely brings me onto the future off this car on the future of that space in itself . What I mean by that space is this sort of super estate cars . Now , when this car launched from this generation off , the RS6 launch was still kind of the only riel proposition in with super estate market's . In a long time since BMW had an M version , often estate car yes , while Mercedes-Benz have the E 63 the way that the space has evolved since this car has launched a competition simply didn't exist . And so I want to talk about the future of this car , how it's going to sit in the coming months on this channel what might be replacing it ? Annals of discussion off the space in general . Now there's been something about the super estate market , which has become fascinating off late now . The previous video to this it was actually me driving the Ferrari G T . C . Four loose . So the B 12 version previously to that drivel V8 . While I guess strictly and technically that is more of a hot patch because it is a hatchback format , I do think it's fundamental . Platform does land itself smack bagging competition with cars like this , despite the fact that the GTC A4 luso , particularly V 12 version , is an additional �200,000 on top of the price of this car .When I drove it , I'm blown away predominantly by . I'm sure regular viewers of this channel know the words about to come out of my mouth but provisionally blown away by the gearbox and the relationship of that gearbox with that wonderful V 12 engine . It was like driving A4 Sita 12 which I mean really , in terms of exciting with practical cars . Where do you go from there ? A four seater half 12 . That's a sense of what it is with four wheel drives , a genuine years , a practical car .Having said that , an element of practicality was stripped out of it because it waas a two door . It is like I said , more off a hot hatch sort of compromised on the complete practicality by making it in two door coupe A8 . However , nothing beats practicality like a general around four door car . Now this and the Panamera Sport Charisma , which is a product that did not exist when this car launched . These two for me still sits at the top off the chain in terms off super steak on super practical wagons . Now I guess as well . At the same time , A product which also didn't exist at that time was Mercedes-Benz 63 4 Matic . Now that car , I had the luxury of driving actually around a circuit . I drove around Silverstone , and that was the mess version . The East 63 S8 A4 matting . That's a four wheel drive E 63 AMG again four wheel drive Am . Jeez , when this girl on did not exist in the estate car market , is that all of a sudden where this car used to rain champion there are now all of these other brands of platforms encroaching on its format . The interesting thing for me is that because Porsche , Volkswagen , Audi , that part of the same group , I'm questioning where the future of this car lies . There's always used to be at the top off superstate cars , but now they have the Panamera sport charisma . Now to clarify that there's a Panamera , there's a Panamera sport . Tourism of the sport . Charisma is basically what I would classify as Porsche's RS6 on why it's concerning May . But because they're inherently from the same group and a similar family , I'm wondering if the next RS6 which I believe will be launching or at least announce next year 2019 . Will the HVAC group allow the Audi RS6 successor to be better ? When I say better , I'd be more powerful than the Porsche equivalent . It's probably unlikely , right ? I mean , the Porsche for a very well suspect sport sure is mo You're looking at least the turbo .You're looking around about �130,000 which is vast coin .Do not get me wrong . Will they push the RS6 that far ? I'm not sure . Now the rumors I picked up on and please accept these as purely rumors . I have nothing tangible of which to back this up , but I'm hearing and hoping that there's gonna be two model variations of the RS6 when it launches on .And I've also heard that it will maintain a V8 engine which when you drive this thing , you'll be very happy now . The generation before this , it was actually a twin turbo charged V 10 engine , as in the V 10 engine that was in the Lamborghini Gallardo and later on the R8 10 . Now they managed to twin turbocharged that car , making incredible . It sounded fantastic .It was incredibly faster when this car launched and it was downsized to the V8 you know , pure . It's tow an enthusiast over the RS6 that time will I want you go get rid of the V 10 . That's such a shame .But when you drive this , it's such a more sophisticated and it's got fantastic talk . Wonderful power in the driveability and usability of it is superior to the old V 10 even though on paper it's sound quite as exotic .And I think history is kind of repeating itself because if you look at cars like the RS5 .They downsized the engine , but the performance is still there . Now the rumor is coming back full circle to the beginning . Off this topic the rumors that they're still gonna maintain twin turbocharged V8 , which is now found in the lap of yours . Which is , I believe , the fastest SUV out there s O . If they maintain that , that would be fantastic . But what else is on the radar ? Which excites me greatly is the notion that there might be a second option of the same car which will be a hybrid RS6 .Now , once again , do not hold me to this . This is just rumors and chance that I've picked up on my various travels around the wonderful cars . But the video before this excited me at the prospect of replacing this with a low mileage pre owns gtc Z4 Luso Sometime next year . The aim of the game is that this car will probably get replaced next year sometime . But I really wanna wait for the replacement of this car to be announced .And if they do a hybrid version , imagine the talk . Imagine the talk of this thing . I mean , already pulls like a mule on crack , but with a hybrid bolted onto as well . Now , if you think about it , that former actually already exists in the Panamera they share very similar to Dr Strength .Speaking of Dry Train , What I hope is gonna come next is potentially an upgraded gearbox now , when the car launched and I've always been somewhat of a gearbox snob . But from a practical car point of you have been able to live with the fact that this isn't a jewel clutch gearbox , even though it's incredibly quick . Most of the time , I'm not grabbing it by the scruff of its neck and driving in 20th . I am using it as a daily practical driver , but it is wonderful to have that power on the braking performance when you needed this one . It was optioned with the optional carbon ceramic brakes . But things have evolved and twin clutch gearbox is becoming more commonplace in high performance cars . And this is why I want to draw parallels between the Panamera sport charisma from essentially the same group that runs a fantastic Jule clutch gearbox . In fact , the best gay box in the world as far as I'm concerned is the portal Pini K . It is an audible tone . Change off cog maneuvers . Honestly , it's It's so Seaver's is so fantastic .

137,211,X3,"the Audi X3 . It's a more discreet type of hot hatch , one that's aimed at people who wear lounge suits rather than track suits . But that doesn't mean that it's algo on .Dhe knows yesterday just looks a little bit more sporty than a normal A3 .That's because you've got this deeper from bumpers with bigger Aaron takes and then down the side . You got larger hallow words of standard , and you've also got some special S8 calipers as well . Down the sides , you've got side skirts . Just help . It looks like it's holding the road bit better . The fact of the suspension is a bit lower . Also , after that , there's a discreet roof spoiler on the back . Because I didn't want this continent to boy Racer , then you really give away . This is a performance , guys , the Red X3 badge and the fact that you got quad tailpipes . That is one of the things I like about this car , Doc . I love the pulsating indicators . Look at that . It's cool . Really cool . I'm not bored yet . Still no board board I .If you are bored of five door hatchback , you could get a sporty looking A3 door version of the X3 and starting at around �33,000 it's about �2000 cheaper than this sport back version , though the five door does get an automatic gearbox is standard . If you click on the pop out banner on the lead below the video , you can save around �3000 on either X3 model through car . Wow dot co dot uk .Inside , you got normal Audi A3 , which means quality is very good , but there are a few upgrades . So you've got a special s on the gear selector . You got S4 at bottom steering world . You've also got X3 on the dollars that I should point out that this car has the optional technology package , which includes digital drivers display and you get leather sports . It's a standard . These seats are graded super sport seats and an extra �700 they're nice . They're holding place pretty well . We go around corners that they're not entirely necessary . As I said earlier , this car is more about the go thin the show . Let's see just how fast it really is . This guy is actually a turbo charged petrol engine with friends and 10 horsepower on E400 Newton meters .It would struggle to put all that power down if it wasn't for the fact that this car comes standard with Cuatro or will drive , and it should be able to do naught to 60 miles an hour in just 4.6 seconds with the automatic gearbox . It's your belt to do it pretty much . Even when the weather is like this . That is a bit of this car , So to launch it , I just put the drive select into dynamic . I put the stability control into sport , the gearbox into sports mode . Then I'll just keep my left on the brake floor . The throw . Now I'm gonna release the brake a little bit of scrub off attraction in this awful weather , but whoa , that was 60 . Way , way , way , way , way . It's like a rocket ship . You can just launch it over and over again . Even when it's peeing down , we ride . Let's find out just how quickly this is treacle to 60 miles an hour .That's just 4.5 seconds , which is quicker than Audi claims . S8 really is a proper wolf in sheep's clothing because while you go about performance for most of the time you're just cruising along its release today , it's as comfy as a big woolly jumper , so this car has the adaptive dampers . The magnetic ride is about nine inch put extra , but it's worth having it , because when you put the car into comfort mode , it slackens them off , and then it deals nicely with bumps on you can Putin around on down actually averaging 30 team Mossberg Alan , which is pretty impressive , really . And I think it's definitely worth spending the extra 1500 quid to get the automatic gearbox because it just takes a strain of everyday life . Commuting on you can change gears yourself if you want using the paddles or if you're just cruising on the motorway , that's really need to overtake . Someone responds really quickly . Yeah , and you're back to being a wolf again . And then what happens if you encounter a twisty road ? Well , you can put the car into dynamic to stiffen up . The suspension also adds weight to the steering , makes exhaust louder on the gearbox shift a bit faster on consuming how wet it is . This thing corners and very , very well , so when the front we'll start to slip , such as they were denied a front wheel drive car . It can send power to the rear to push you out the corner , and it just grips and goes like a good . It's more fun in the old M3 , which felt totally inert . But still , I don't think you feel quite as much as you do in a golf . I it doesn't feel quite , is adjustable . You lift off the throttle , make corner , but still most people most of the time cruising around this is gonna be great for them .And don't forget , you still have all the benefits of a normal Audi A3 like decent rear passenger space and good practicality .Though there is one compromise . The X3 is Booth is about 42 smaller than the normal A3 is because of the Quattro or will dry system has rear differential , which goes underneath the boot floor , and it means that you don't have extra under floor stories like you would do in a normal car . Still , a slightly smaller boot is a small price to pay for all that extra boot you get from the engine . So really no . One he's going to care .So that was my final verdict on the Audi X3 . Well , it may not be the most fun Ha touch , but it's very quick on its super stylish . Maybe enjoy this video , please like it show and subscribe to our tunnel , taking on the windows for more confident ."
138,212,GOC 43,"So you want a smallest Mercedes SUV , but you also want to go fast , but not too fast . That's just right .Performance upgrades , which will touch on a bit later .Goc 43 sports a distinctive look all its own , starting with a unique grill insert and wider . Aaron takes up front and aggressive diffuser and chrome or black that exhaust tips out back , complimenting the lower ride height or staggered with tires to 55 up front and to 85 with the rear wrapped around 20 inch or optional 21 inch AMG wheels .That racy thing continues inside , where you'll find the usual suspects like extra bolstering on the front seats , carbon fiber accents , super fancy red contrast , dishing and a flat bottom steering wheel makes the rocket rule go around .Hey , I'll be honest . I've never been a huge fan of high performance SUVs . To me , they make about as much sense as a lifted roadster . But if you're into this sort of thing , the GOC 43 won't disappoint .So is the comment section begins to fill it with words like for I'll touch on the things that make the GOC 43 go starting with a biter movie six that cranks out 362 horsepower and £384 feet of torque .And what an engine it is . Ah , like a lot of turbo charged engines in this class , the AMG doesn't fall on its face as you approach the ever rpm range . Instead , it pulls hard from down low all the way to the 6500 rpm limit .Well , it does admit a subtle boy racer drone at low speeds . Higher rpm's exhaust sounds fantastic .Initiate the decelerate tricks . Goc stops in a hurry , plus break feel . Overall , it's really good .With a little help from a quick witted nine speed automatic , Goc can sprint from 0 to 60 in about 4.8 seconds .That time is also aided by an AMG tuned all wheel drive system that sends 69% of torque to the rear wheels by the phone .Yes , the engine is undoubtedly the centerpiece of any AMG car , but in this case , I think the crown jewels the old drive system way .Combined with some sticky continental rubber , Goc 43 is a legitimate handling car .Firm of the dramatic Danvers chassis doesn't roll past a few degrees , no matter how unrefined you're turning . But as you probably guessed , the 43 does not possess the simple ride quality that makes the standard GLC such a joy to drive .It isn't harsh but smooth .It is not , and with the starting price of around $56,000 also isn't cheap , their own more operate .Thankfully , though , this price include the number of desirable standards , like passive entry of push button start 14 way Driver's seat with Memory Power Lift Gate Ah , hi mounted seven inch displayed link to a backup camera . A5 drive votes , including a configurable individual setting and a three mode air suspension that could be raised with the push of a button at an apple leather premium audio .Beiber master led headlights , inactive safety aids like lane departure assist . Automatic pre collision breaking and full range adaptive cruise control with low speed follow capability .And you're looking at right around $68,000 for a well option GOC 43 .If you prefer something that appears less practical but actually isn't , there's the Goc 43 coupe , which embodies all the engaging dynamic qualities of its conventionally styled sibling , but with a more let's just say interesting shape .Clearly , a super sporty crossover isn't for everyone , including me . But for the right buyer , Goc , 43 checks all the right boxes ."
139,213,SL C300,"So you want a coupe and convertible and they only have 50 $80,000 to spend . It sounds like you need to consider the Mercedes-Benz .SL sees Plan for Your Life , Formerly known as the SLK , S . L . C is a rear wheel drive , two seat convertible that comes in two forms .The SL C300 , featuring a two litre turbo charged four cylinder , and the racier AMG SLC 43 with its bi turbo three leader . Be six . Yes , the old SLK could be had with a 5.5 meter V8 with V six is really good . Power comes out quickly and there's plenty of it . Mash the throttle from a standstill , and the SLC 43 goes from 0 to 60 in about 4.6 seconds . Or it'll also spend the tires and freak out of Jason drivers shining .The best light on the engine is a nine speed automatic transmission that shared with the base four cylinder . When you request more speed transmission shifts with staggering immediacy , even better you can control it with the paddle shifters that operate with a really satisfying mechanical fuel .Yeah , side note . The gear shifter itself is hilariously small you ever make a Power Wheels version of the SLC ? This part will carry right over .The SLC 43 has a notable power advantage over its four cylinder sibling , but it also rides on a much stiffer suspension . And that stiffness , while enhancing his dynamic abilities , also enhances the imperfections of the road .He planned to drive your Mercedes-Benz at a modest pace and based on largely accurate stereotypes , you probably will . The SL C300 is probably the better choice . Choosing the weaker SLC feels wrong just now that the base four cylinder is a fine engine , offering a perfectly zippy 0 to 60 time under six seconds .Yes , L .C is fun to drive and steers with joyful urgency , but it's also several £100 heavier than , let's say , the Porsche S7 18 Boxter kind of driver who lives their life in the corners .Maybe deferred a team portion if you really dig stable , high speed cruising , maybe should rock the beefy SLC .Contributing to the SLC heft is its retractable hard top .

It looks so special that it spawned a new hyphenated subdivision of Mercedes . AMG .Aluminum is used for most of the chassis in adjoining suspension components in an effort to keep weight down and rigidity up , though it's still tips the scales but rather portly £3600 .Additional stiffening measures include optional dynamic engine and transmission mounts , multitude of chassis braces with remote , electronically controlled suspension GTS models . Thankfully , this flex a phobic philosophy won't also require you to put your car factors Kids through college , one of the harshest criticisms leveled against AMG models your was the typical American roadways , right ? Quality was positively punishing . This is totally livable . You're not gonna compressed vertebrae . You're not gonna forget how to do math . It's just a daily , driveable , civilized supercar when you want it to be now on the track . Virtually everywhere the SL s failed GT-R succeeds first and foremost is in the area of oversteer . That's when the rear tires distraction before the front . But all thrusters make it look pretty cool .It's not the right way to set fast laps , for instance , through Willow Springs in From this tornado , practically every a M G model I've ever driven after been quite a few wants to step out Moment . You add about 50% throw . GT-R is having none of it . 40 50 60 70 80 90 finally begins to step out , unwind the steering wheel and open it up .It's a hell of a thing .Longitudinal G forces come courtesy of a four litre twin turbo V8 that puts out 456 GT-R 500E A3 Horsepower GTS .

Top speed might seem a bit underwhelming to discerning Vin diesel types . But the real story here is the way in which the GT and GTS deliver their power torque arrives . A3 even reads the 2000 rpm mark . Power continues to surge in such a dramatic yet orderly manner . That additional thrust would almost certainly upset the harmonious balance of the car .Of course , Mercedes-Benz is a business operation . Customers who can't help but play the numbers game and soon spring for the limited edition GT-R variant .No , not that one boasting an over abundance of power and additional active aero bits for a lot more money . Now back to the powertrain .But more often than not , there's a delay between the time you depress the paddle shifter and when the mechanical shift occurs . Not so with the A8 GT-R moment you depress the paddle gearshift occurs in terms of breaking . The pedal field isn't quite as linear is in 9 11 Stopping power . Absolutely tremendous . In the matter of survivability , we've done 2025 fairly hard last 102 degrees in the Merc just keeps asking for more and again we did detect some intermittent shuttering but accelerating slowly from a stop .

142,216,C Class,"Mercedes-Benz class . It's not just Mercedes-Benz sized luxury entry .It's also the cheapest way into the Mercedes-Benz brand . At least here in America .Game with vehicle with potential to create brand loyalists , it's essential the C class stay fresh and competitive . That end Mercedes-Benz has given the latest Jen C Class a thorough renovation . Let's discuss The most obvious component of the C Class is refreshed is a substantial exterior makeover . Sure , new headlines faces , et cetera . Make for a hotter looking sedan , but we've saved the bulk of our excitement for the new C Class coupe . Mercedes hasn't sold a C Class coupe in the US since the mid two thousands , but this time , instead of making it an oddly proportioned , goofball value proposition , the new C coop looks every bit as provocative . Is the sedan probably more so , Just minus two doors in person ? The coop really looks great , and it comes with a standard panoramic sunroof . So fun and style are clearly priorities for the two door A4 doors can choose between luxury and sport variants of the sedan , with the luxury version looking sophisticated and the sport version boasting sport focus styling inside and out along with the lower right hi fun fact Coop is nearly identical to the sedan in all dimensions except one .Can you guess which ? If you have eyes and can see me now , you probably guessed hype . No problem , slouch a little bit . And headroom isn't an issue . Plus a nice contrast with the type a go getter persona you're putting out by driving a Mercedes C haven't sold out .Unsurprisingly , the interior looks and feels like a premium car .Should we have a complaint ? Seat backs in the front create a pressure point between my shoulder blades . Maybe it's this little hump right here . Or maybe I just have a freakish back shake that's on me .It's a testament to the C Class is 1.8 litre direct injection turbocharged engine that I didn't initially ? No , it was a four cylinder . I mean , really paid attention . I probably have noticed that there's a little extra buzz coming through the steering wheel , but there's enough power that you don't really think . Ah , this must be a turbo charged for another Part of the problem is that receive . These are known for Laghi throttle . Help disguise the fact that when you get on the throttle . Take just a moment from the turbos .Spool up drivers who want increased throttle responsiveness . There's a button here sport . You can push it . Things get a little better , but you still have to wait for the transmission to downshift and the engine to rise and revs for really kicking the power eyes .Also a new 3.5 litre direct injection V six delivering 302 horsepower .Both it and the four cylinder , compared with seven speed automatic transmissions featuring paddle shifters . For those who want manual control , a couple more powertrain notes .C Class sedan can also be had with the previous generation 228 horsepower . Three liter V six paired with all wheel drive . More interestingly , E400 51 horsepower C 63 AMG that we know and love now comes in both sedan and coupe forms . We really need to get our hands on the C 63 Freeway .The C Class does that whole high speed , stable German cruising thing Really well , Cabin stays quiet on . The ride is nice and smooth . Also , this shy away from the corners . Good grip . A nice direct steering ultimately there might be a luxury midsize sedan or two that are more engaging . Drive them , See Lasse , but more than holds it has a new hold feature . You come to a stop , press the brake pedal once hard , and the vehicle will hold itself in place until you press the throat . It's not like gently resting . My foot on the brake pedal was ever particularly grueling ordeal , but now trips through the El Poco Loco drive through or all that more relaxing First World problem saw attention .Assist is an interesting feature . Watches for tail tail driver inputs that suggest the nut behind the wheel might be drowsy . If you're tired , it alerts you and suggest you stop for a nap or coffee with the kind of electronic nagging that could save lives on the information and entertainment front .A new 5.8 inch screen is standard , while the optional comand system comes bundled with this seven inch display , a rear view camera and navigation l worked fine , but sometimes I think I'd prefer a simpler touch screen .The whole grab rotates select routine required by the optional COMAND system . Remember that's command with one M and in all caps , you know , like a German is screaming at in terms of safety .The C Class has air bags of plenty , nine standard airbags in the sedan and an impressive 11 in the Coop sedan airbag total rises to 11 with the addition of the optional rear side impact bags .There are also a plethora of features available in the C class that have made their way down from or expensive Mercedes-Benz models .These include a blind spot warning system lane departure warning system , automatic high beams and a parking guidance feature that helps identify appropriately sized parking spots that helps guide you into them .Key competitors for the Mercedes-Benz C class include the Audi A4 BMW three series base price less than $36,000 including destination .You could get into a C Class sedan for about the same Costas A3 Siri's with base A4 cost several $1000 less that any big , glaring , obvious flaws .Choosing between luxury midsize German sedans is largely a matter of taste .You want a comfortable , beautifully style sedan coupe with your performance piece and fuel economy and a bunch of nifty technology .So Mercedes-Benz classes"
143,217,C Class,"After countless decades , we pretty much know what to expect from luxury car manufacturers . Mercedes-Benz , for example . The car's air posh , luxurious but not intensely emotional isn't refreshing when carmakers surprise you .This sexy beast is the Mercedes Benz C class for years that occupied the entry level spot in the Mercedes lineup with that honor now falls to the C . L . A , thus freeing the C Class to move slightly upmarket move that bolsters its position against compact luxury rivals like the BMW three , Siri's , Audi A4 and Lexus I s in latest form . The C class is grown by 3.7 inches in length , 1.6 inches in width . At the same time , it's about £200 lighter than the previous version to all the aluminum producers watching , thanks less weight means better performance and a notable improvement in fuel economy , and it be natural to focus on that stuff .But instead , let's just stare at the exterior where Mercedeses skewed upscale but reserved . The newest C Class retained the luxurious persona but marries it with athleticism and artful design , its long nose , short , rear and taut body lines combining the harmonious whole that looks elegant yet strong . In simplest terms , the C Class has presence . It's a Mercedes that's a motive , not uptight .Exterior is the bait , the interiors , the hook Absolutely gorgeous in here . If you were to take all of this and transplanted to aim or expensive luxury car , nobody would cry foul . In many ways , it's the tactical details that set the C class apart . The materials and buttons feel expensive . The window switches move with a light . But precise action events make a subtle , satisfying click when centered . Encasing this touch worthy goodness in such an attractive design , unsurprisingly , results in a stunning interior .Before we get too breathless with our praise , there is an issue of usability . While beautifully arranged . Actually , using these controls can be a little bit tricky . For example , there's no dedicated button for skipping to the next track . If you want to do that , you have to use either this rotary knob or this touch pad . But you can't do that right now . First you have to go with the button , rotate over to media . Select that , and now you can either slide or rotate . Also figuring out whether or not you have to use the touch pad or the rotary knob for a variety of functions . Not obvious . Before you say we'll just use the buttons on the steering wheel . Uh , same deal . If you want to go forward on the track , have to . What do you have to do down the media ? Hey , now we're on the trolley . In an era of increasingly intuitive technology , the C Class has a learning curve .I did discover that if you push this button right here in the back side of the track pad , it pops this up right here , allowing you to swipe forward or back on the tracks . It's not perfect , but it is something .Despite the C class is generational size increase . Rear seat headroom is tight for taller passengers , while a pronounced center tunnel makes three wide seating a questionable proposition .As for trunk space , there's a reasonable 12.8 cubic feet to play with Oh , and an amazing optional expanding box , for I'm assuming loose tangerines and stuffed animals .All that said , if you're sitting up front , more than generous dimensions and a satisfying drive should help you forget your less than blissful rear passengers .Mercedes-Benz C Class has never been a prime choice for crisp driving dynamics , but in this latest iteration , it is kind of inching in that direction . It's nimble , sure footed , and you can flick it into corners and a lot of fun .A8 that said , You do get the sense that the steering wheel isn't giving you all the information about what the front tires were up to . Keep in mind that that's not necessarily a complaint , just like industrial chicken farming and politics . Some people don't want to know the gritty details of the road they're driving over .Building on the idea of strategically withholding information , Mercedes-Benz C Class isolates its occupants from tedious wind and road noise . Even a freeway speeds . The cabin remains wonderfully serene .Toss in strong acceleration and a chassis that absorbs road imperfections with relative ease . You have a luxury car that's an absolute pleasure to drive neither rear or $2000 price .You're all wheel drive form . C300 features an eager , turbo charged four cylinder engine at tops 30 miles per gallon on the freeway , making the equivalent BMW three . Siri's amore efficient choice Propulsion in this E400 comes courtesy of a naturally aspirated V six paired with all wheel drive , while year changes in either trim are handled by a seven speed automatic transmission .A basic rear drive , Mercedes-Benz C300 starts under $40,000 .Includes dual zone climate control .He lis engine starts , M B text , faux leather upholstery , a power memory driver's seat , seven airbags and collision prevention assist plus radar based system that can automatically apply the brakes to reduce the severity of a collision .A6 fancier taste can be appeased by way of the option sheet .He 650I Dollar luxury package adds a comfort tuned suspension along with classy aesthetic touches , including a classic raised star logo on the hood on the opposite end of the spectrum , a 22 $100 sport package adds sporty details throughout while dropping the car 1000.6 inches on a performance tuned suspension .Other standout add ons , including multimedia package with backup camera navigation and a point for infotainment screen that replaces the standard seven inch unit and air suspension with comfort and sport modes . A premium package with Vour , Mr Audio and various Elektronik assists for inattentive drivers like Traffic Jam assistant , which automatically follows the car ahead and stop and go traffic .The more powerful C E400 checks in at a little less than $50,000 though that some does include many of the C300 optional features .Where the competition is concerned , you've got more exhilarating , more attainable , more American and perhaps more responsible choices .But the Mercedes-Benz C Class , though higher on the pricing spectrum , sits in an intriguing intersection between quality , comfort and performance .Luxury buyers have strong opinions about their cars . You're BMW person , Alexis person , whatever . It's doubtful that's going to change anytime soon . But if there were ever an argument convinced compact luxury buyers to jump ship and joined Mercedes , this might be it ."
144,218,C Class,"you know what an automaker produces , a convertible version of a performance car that supposed to retain all the concentrated goodness of its hard top counterpart ? Well , more often than not , something gets lost in the D roofing process . In the end result is a car that feels like it's missing a chromosome .This is not one of those cars standard GT-R , the higher performing GTC . Both roasters feel just a solidly put together as the fixture of models turn in .And no , not even a hint of that awkward delay between your steering input on the chassis response , which is a common side effect of the convertible transition surgery .It is just rock . So so , with uncertainties about structural integrity out of the way , you're free to enjoy the open air experience , especially with windows up .When protection is really good , there's no annoying buffeting at high speeds . The window headers place blown away , so do not obstruct your upward visibility , and you can deploy were retract the soft top and about 11 seconds at speeds up to 31 miles an hour .X1 soft top suppresses wind noise just as good as the hard time , though there are a few rattles coming from , but you should keep it down anyway , not just because it looks better , because then there's nothing between you and this .Producing that glorious sound is A4 leader by Tero V8 , that cranks out 469 horsepower A4 , £65 feet of torque in GT speck and 550 horsepower and 500E to pound feet of torque in the GTC .Shifty duties air handled via A7 speed dual clutch automatic . Who , shifting communication times rival those of Porsche's benchmark P D . K . Gearbox that I can't pronounce .And despite carry around an extra £120 or so GT-R GTC roadsters , it still dash from 0 to 60 in 3.7 in 3.9 seconds , respectively .Okay , so let's say you want one . Get afford one . Do you go with the roughly $120,000 GT-R Step up to the GTC ?Well , do you want real well staring a limited slip differential , multi mode , adaptive suspension , electrically controlled exhaust system , nappa leather and wider rear end .If the answer is yes , prepared to dish out another $40,000 or so , But I got to say after spending a fair amount of seat time in both . Unless you're an extremely talented driver who could take a car like this to 20th not you'll be just as happy in a G T and for a lot less money .And we'll both models carrying nearly $10,000 premium over there fixture of can .It's worth reiterating that in this case , anyway , ditching the top does nothing but enhance the driving experience in every measurable way ."

Sir , On the entry level , S E card doesn't have satellite Navigation is standard , though It's not the end of the world , because you do get apple Carplay andhra daughter so you can use the maps from your phone .But really , at this price point , it's a bit mean , isn't it ?

One slight problem is that this guy isn't great for carrying three in the back . Because this middle chair is a bit small in the outer two . And you got this huge lump in the floor . So yeah , it's a bit from this seat on dhe . Well , you have got enough room in the foot . Well , thankfully on headroom isn't bad in the middle , but , you know , it could be a little bit better .You do have the option of falling down . These a drama rested with some cupholders in there on .If you paint it C300 so pounds you can get seats which slide on recliners . Well , depending on whether you want it , will passenger space or boot space , doesn't it ?Now , in terms of boot space , the capacity is on a par with its German rivals . When you got the seats in the normal configuration , you also stand to get a automated tailgate . You may like that , or you may know it depends on your point of view . So the bitch itself is a nice square shape , but it's not 100% perfect . For instance , there is a little ridge to lift stuff over . It's not too bad , but other cars like this you can slide him straight out . There is no lip . Also icon for the life of me find a 12 volt socket in here , a standard . There are various tethering points here and here under this floor . Yes , there's not much room for anything else . We've got all the gubbins for the puncture repair kit now . Like I said earlier , this one has the upgraded rear seats on , as well as being all to move forwards and backwards actually moving forward . You increase the boots capacity by around affair . You can fold them down individually . So look , you can fall down the middle one on this other car . You can't do that and you can fool the others using these levers . The only problem is as you can see they don't actually fall down very well on their own accord . So you have to Kevin , do it yourself . I want you moving down . You kind of got a almost continuous load space there . It's a little bit of a fact . You don't expect that from an Audi , do you ? You want more detail on this car's practicality can click it there to watch my detailed practicality video so much stuff you can fit in this car's boot .Harry's It is to fit a child seat and exactly what it's like with three adults in the back .So far , then the Audi G5 is pretty impressive . How does it feel ? Road First question you might have is , Is this SUV in a sports utility vehicle ? Exciting on the answer to that is no bearded X5 is more fun to drive . However , the other question you probably have is is it a good car to drive on ? The answer to that is without doubt , yes , so this thing steers well enough because our corners well , there's loads of grip . All models come with Cuatro war will drive , yet you know it does all that it needs to . It's comfortable as well . So I do have a word of warning . You see , this particular model is yes , light . It's got lowered , stiffened suspension on it , perhaps rides a little bit too firmly . But if you ask your dealer to go with the normal suspension , yeah , goes over very , very well . However , for around �1000 you can get the optional adaptive dampers on . Then it's even more comfortable . You know better than that .Around �2000 more .You can actually get this car with air suspension , and then it just glides on the road like a luxury limousine . Now you can also alter the height of the car with that if you wanted , which is identical . Wanna go off roading , though ? To be fair , if you're into off roading Landrover Discovery sport is better . But let's be honest . How many people take these kind of cars off road ?Hardly any tens of engines . You can get a V six to buy petrol in the S Q5 , and I'll do north 60 in around five seconds if you want pays . But with better economy , you've got to get a V six diesel . Now most people go for a four cylinder engine . And if you've been port off diesels of light , then the two litre TF Excitable petrol is pretty good . However , if you can forgive Audi of Diesel Gate , then the two it is in this car is actually better . Bet because it's pretty much just as quick on more economical . Now , all Audi Q5 come with an automatic gearbox standard on . The interesting thing is one of this car , it actually includes a launch control function to never gonna use it . But so long as you've got the car in its dynamic mode , you got the stability control in sports mode . The gearbox is in . Sports made we have to do is pull up . Put your left foot on the brake for the throne , will hold the revs , release the brake and goes , and apparently , this call do naught to 62 miles an hour in 7.9 seconds , though that will , of course , affect your economy . This particular car , specially 55 miles per gallon , though I'm getting 39 I'm a little bit disappointed in that other things about this car that disappoint me .Visibility .Actually , it's pretty good , and if you click it there you can see for yourself by joining me for 360 degree passage arrived video something else , then maybe the fact that you do notice a tire or a bit , but I don't think that's because this car has particularly bad road noise levels . It's just that is seen to pick it up because there's absolutely no wind noise at all . That's PolitiFact . You've got this acoustic windscreen , which deadens most of sound .I just thought of something . If you paid her for the politest assist , the car can effectively drive itself . It's just that you can take your hands off the wheel for too long . Otherwise , the system disengages , which is a bit of a show , because otherwise you could use the car pretty much as a chauffeur just jump into the back .They're already making disengaged for legal reasons and safely so pretty calm picked that .Okay , what else ? Um oh , I know . Did I say this isn't the most exciting X3 V8 to drive ? I did . I said that the beginning , didn't I ?Okay , well , I guess I'm doing here . Actually , the Audi Q5 isn't perfect . They're awesome . And doing things about it is five .The rear windows don't go along the way down . Really , really annoys me .Hel hold assist is a �75 option . I mean , come on , Audi .The system's already pretty install what kind of people Audi drivers tend to like to look cool , so it's a bad miss that Audi hasn't specifically built in a sundress is holder somewhere in the car .While the light cover is fairly easy , actually , no clever stories place within the car for you to leave it , even though it's all new , this new Q5 rather similar to the old Q5 .So there's older . There's a new one , always about the older Mr New York .Actually , I'm just trying to make a point .Thankfully , the Q5 has planted call features which more than make up for all this .The satnav can learn your preferred regular routes are sending the best one , depending on the time of day traffic .The optional led matrix headlamps come block off parlor bto . Don't dazzle oncoming drivers . Also , when you're approaching junction , the beam span convict wider like this .Get wireless charging for your mobile . Well , if your phone is not enough of that from charity plus this slightly trey allows you to keep your mobile phone actress .I too distracted by leaving the side mirrors from there to there , has helped make this car the most aerodynamic in its class works .The car has to fix fittings on the front passenger seat , though it's not exactly ideal .Your big get there , you gotta call out dot co dot uk for more information and to save around �2000 on a new Audi G5 . So then what's my verdict on this car should do . Avoid it , should he consider it . Should you short list it , or should you just go right ahead and buy it ? Well , I reckon you should go right ahead by the Q5 . It might be the most exciting car in the world , but it's a brilliant all rounder on one of the very best premium Etsy V's .

146,220,S Class,"full size luxury sedans are essentially rolling showcases for brands , foremost innovations , technology , refinement , safety , design and , of course , comfort . But what if you want all that flagship goodness in a smaller or mid size package ?There's the 10th Generation E Class Way E class .To be regarded as a downsized flagship , it must exude a distinct air of sophistication and prestige . Thus it's strong resemblance to the vaunted s class . The same goes for the interior , which in some cases actually tops others from the class above . It finishes utterly flawless , and the materials would not be out of place in a car cost in well over six figures .A centerpiece is undoubtedly this single pane , dual screen display . The instrument cluster offers three configurable design themes and , like Audi , is virtual cockpit . There's also an embedded navigation map . The entertainment center now provides split screen functionality along with Apple carplay , an android Auto immigration .Although the operation is a bit clunky , given that both interfaces are optimized for a touch screen and this is not a touch screen , no matter how hard I press . And yes , if you embrace an analog lifestyle , it may take you a few weeks , or Maur to master this version of Mercedes-Benz command . But there are a few shortcuts to help streamline the process , like three home buttons , physical menu controls and a small touch pad on the left side of the steering wheel that controls the instrument cluster and one on the right that operates the main display pretty well thought out .Ah , more critical note . The front seats will exceptionally comfortable and supportive . Retain heat is if they're still in their plasma state . So if you live in a warmer climate , it would be wise to choose the ventilated seating option .And so long as we're nit picking the interior , the moon roof shade annoyingly lets a fragmented patch of sunlight to hit your face like an intense scene from a classic noir film .There's not much to complain about out back , thanks to an abundance of leg room and head room in the outboard positions complemented by rear climate controls , an optional power sunshades pulling the conveniently located seat releases transforms the ease , comparatively roomy trunk into a nearly flat , SUV like load floor .Not surprisingly , E class further cement its appeal on the road .When you're driving a business class luxury sedan . There are often moments when the car reminds you , be it through ride , compliance , road noise or even seek comfort that you're not in a flagship and you got what you paid for . Not so in the glass . Virtually everything about the driving experience screams a class above . That is assuming you spring for a well equipped model like our test unit here , even if you choose to forgo the optional multimodal air suspension , right quality still spot on .Merck's annoying trend of keeping the steering wheel slightly to the left and the modern models makes an unwelcome appearance in the E Class .But the precision and proper waiting of the system will probably make you forget all about it . Unlike the Jag , XF or even the five , Siri's E class isn't exactly eager to be pitched aggressively in the corners . No , it is open to the idea and more or less willing for something brimming with Halo car qualities .You might think the base four cylinder engine is unfit for the job , but you're wrong . Don't you ever get tired of being wrong all the time ? F40 one horsepower into £73 feet of torque delivers perfectly acceptable acceleration , one with about 24 mpg combined in real world conditions . And best of all , this does not sound idol or feel like a four cylinder engine . Not good enough . You've got options thief , first of which is the E400 twin Turbo V six , producing nearly 25% more power than the Turbo four in close to 400 horsepower in the up tuned E 43 a M G variant standing atop the performance hierarchy in the Mercedes AMG 63 roughly 600 horsepower Super sedan designed to compete against the BMW M5 Lexus GS F , Audi are seven and Ford Fusion Sport . I mean , maybe also joining the lineup shortly after launch is a plug in hybrid model capable of traveling up to 20 miles on battery power alone . All conventionally powered engines , apart from the E 63 route power to the rear or all four wheels are a buttery , smooth nine speed automatic transmission .Pricing for the E class begins right around $53,000 including destination fees with coops . Cabriole is in seven passenger wagons commanding higher entry points , although AMG models already include all wheel drive , a standard fare , adding it to your initial ism free e class will set you back an extra $2500 . BMW five . Siri's largely shares its pricing structure with the E Audi A6 and Lexus GS undercut it by roughly $6000 . That price difference , though , is a bit deceiving . Seeing his need her car can match the e class is standard equipment roster , dropping the actual price disparity to about $3500 ?Speaking of which face C300 comm , fitted with notable niceties like led headlights , rain sensing windshield wipers , navigation with a 12.3 inch display .Driver's seat memory A5 driving modes , including an individual setting automatic collision breaking in vehicle to excommunication that consent and received pertinent driving information from infrastructure as well as other connected cars .Recommendable add ons consist of multi contour front seats . Feature . A massage function and Maura just ability than most people would know to do with beautifully arranged Ambien interior lighting with 64 color selections .14 Speaker Burmester Sound System , a 360 degree HD camera system , handsfree trunk speed sign scanning , active swerve control and autonomous lane .Changing assist in a class where there are no bad options . It takes special effort to stand out from the pack . But Mercedes-Benz put forth the effort , built a spectacular piece of machinery that's sure to put the rest of the segment on notice ."
147,221,GL ,"we're in San Antonio , Texas , getting a first look at the fourth generation Mercedes-Benz G L size German SUV that was formerly known as the M Class , and it hasn't had a redesign in awhile . So this one is significant .Let's start with the suspension base model G L . A . Standard Springs and Damper set up , which is good . And then there's the available aromatic suspension . But the G Eli's all new , intelligent electric suspension , called E Active Body Control , is something I want to throw a dance party for . Springs and dampers can be controlled individually , each wheel making it completely customizable for whatever situation you find yourself in . And get this , it can even bounce the vehicle up and down to free the G l E . If it gets stuck in sand so party worthy before the court .Other systems called Road Surface Scan and Curve will use cameras to read the conditions of the road . Now , based on what those cameras see , it'll adjust the suspension so that the driver and their passengers have a really nice , comfortable Mercedes ish dr across the board .I can't emphasize enough how great the ride quality is in this SUV While you're gliding comfortably down the road , the G L E features a completely new , highly customizable multimedia system with larger screens that could be operated by touch pad touch screen , which is a bit sensitive gesture , control or voice control saying , Hey , Mercedes workup the voice activated system . But be careful that you don't say , Let's call it the M word too much because she will keep talking to you the entire time you're driving .She knows nothing . Go go away .No . In addition to the all new and quite intuitive , Mercedes-Benz BU X interface that debuted on the eight class Apple , Carplay and Android Auto are both available .An extensive list of safety features such a stop and go assist steering assist and lane change assist are there to keep driver and passengers collectively out of trouble .Under the hood , there are two options . A two litre four cylinder turbo available in the G l E 3 50 but this one I'm driving is the 4 50 has a three liter inline six supercharged turbo with e que boost . And all I can say is wow .Also new to that inline six is a 48 volt electrical system that eliminates all of the belts from the engine . So the water pump , the air conditioning and the supercharger none of those used belts anymore . Additionally , there is no alternator in this car . That's what the hybrid motor does now . All of the mumbo jumbo that I just said basically adds up to 0 to 60 in 5.5 seconds , which hey , let's face it for an SUV . What's that ?Engine options are made it to a nine speed automatic transmission . But , boy , I love the sound of that street A6 .That's good .There are a lot of luck . See extras on the interior like leather , piano , black and chrome trim pieces .We do see some plastic stuff that's very un Mercedes and even front seat massage Mercedes .The exterior sees some vast improvements as well . Front Bhatia is more aggressive looking in athletic . The rear view ain't to bad either . G . L . A . More defined and distinctive look .It also has a longer real base by 3.2 inches and shorter overhangs at the rear and the front , which creates more space in the interior . And also it's easier to get over stuff should you choose to take it off road . Thanks to that extended wheelbase , there's an optional , all electronically operated third row of seats , with all seats folded . The cargo floor lays flat and offers plentiful space .Pricing wasn't available with the making of this video , but base price on the outgoing model starts around $53,000 so expected to be somewhere close .We do know deliveries start in the summer of 2019 . In such a competitive segment , Mercedes-Benz a showstopper with this one , and they straight up brought down the house with the jelly . No doubt fellow Germans that BMW X5 and the Audi Q7 will do something to counter .But the upgrades and innovations in this Mercedes-Benz Q3 g l dancing around its competition quite nicely ."
148,222,TT,"the Audi TT .Now this is a stylish sports car on .You know , you shouldn't be put off by the fact that it has a reputation for being driven by people who work in a certain profession . Because , actually , for a small , sporty coupe A8 , it's recently practical that couriers could probably use it . So the boot is about the same size as a Ford fiesta is . The only problem is , is that well , it can only carry things in a certain configuration because the boot is quite shallow , and I think that's a big problem . But we can do is just remove the parcel shelf , put it in there and then fall down these rear seats nice and easy to give you a big load . Audi , which really for a sporty car . It's quite impressive . Look at that . And actually , mares are just trouble with the seats like that anyway because , well , it would be brutally honest .The backseats are nothing more than a gesture , because so tiny getting in bloom in art as well may look at this . It's embarrassing , really sliding in less , not entirely sure I get the seat down , I can't get the seat down But now call me . I'm stuck . Andi . Yeah , I don't really need to say much about what it's like back in . I think a picture paints 1000 words and look at this . I don't even think that children be good back here . You do have some scientifics for very small children so you could get a baby seat . If you want to see what it's like fitting a baby seat in this Audi TT , click in the top right hand corner of the screen on the card , and you can also see what it's like . Two adults in the back bit funny that one on , do you ?Well , to see how much stuff you can fit in the boot now I'm going to get out of it .Because , let's face it , you don't fight on Audi T t for its practicality . Oh , my gosh , this is This is like being born again . I was a breech birth . I'm caught up in court in this court court . Okay , right , So you don't buy an Audi TT for its practicality .You buy it for its style , and it's a stunning looking sports car . It's got that instantly recognizable spelt t t shape in this and really cool design details as well , such as the lights on the indicators and it's the same story on the inside . So this is a perfect example of German Bauhaus minimalism , and he just looks so supercool and some nice design details as well .Francis As an option , you can house the climate control controls action , the center of the event .It's really nice when you sent this teacher you think , actually , what ? It's tying the back in the front .It feels quite spaces , because it's quite a white car on this , um , okay , ish practicality . So the door bins can just about hold a big bottle . But the best bit for May is this virtual cockpit that you get the cost . There's no central screen . You have all the information you need and the entertainment system right there in the eye line , and you can change the view of it .You can cycle through the different menus , and you basically control everything , including the satnav here , through the wheel . Or , if you want to , you can do it here through the swivel will on the system is really , really good to use , and if you click in the top right corner of the screen on the card you can see at in depth review of it .Now there is one problem with the TT is that it's rather expensive , especially if you had some options on top of it . But on the flip side , you will get quiet all of your money back when you come to sell it on . That's because it's a very desirable car packed with call features , and here's five more of them .The indicator lights don't flash pulls at first , either .There's only one cup holder , but it's actually supplied a second . Flip that one in there .There's no fuel for the captain screen just popping off straight in the eye .The TT is up to 50 kilos lighter than its predecessor , which about the same as a very skinny passenger , the optional led Matrix Headlines Container port of there being to prevent dozen of the drivers . Unfortunately , not everything about the TT is great .The TT is quite expensive , yet no bottle comes with satin up or even cruise control is standard .You'll get what's coming but joking with maneuvering at low speed , you can't get quadrille will drive models with a manual gearbox .Passenger doesn't have a very good view . The entertainment screen .So the comedy operates stuff for you , but you can't complain too much as the Audi TT is brilliant to drive first generation Audi Titi look like a really cool sports car , but it's a bit disappointed to drive .The second generation version was a big improvement , but with this third generation bottle , I think out his engineers of finally granted because it feels genuinely sporty and engaging . In fact , it's great fun . Yet it's also surprisingly comfortable having me that is the holy grail of body motoring .Now , little word of warning for you . If you want to go for the bigger wells , would you probably will ?Look , Cole please fit the car with the adaptive suspension because that has a comfort mode , and it just helps take the sting , those extra jobs to get through the body . If you have those bigger wheels , I think you should be aware off . Is that what this card does ? He handles brilliantly in the way the front wheel drive version can sometimes struggle to put its power down as it's coming out of a corner . So If you want a weather who image you're gonna need to get yourself . The grippy quarter will will drive .Model engine range in the TT is brilliant . They're all good . So if you want economy , you can get a two litre diesel which is fast and frugal . My pick of the range is one of the two litre turbo engines and this is the low power bush in 250 horsepower on its Maur .So this one's got the S tronic automatic gearbox A7 speed and it does really fast changes . I mean , to be fair , the manual is really nice to use , but there is an advantage of the seven speed or does make the car slightly quicker 62 miles an hour .So this one will do naught to 62 miles an hour in just A5 on one of the reasons that it couldn't do that is the fact that it's got launch control . And when you combine the Lord Control with a four world drive system , you could do incredible things in this car . So basically right , I am sat in what looks a bit like a lake . I'm going to quickly engage launch control we'll go do is put the stability control into sport mode the gearbox into sport mode floor the throttle home before the break , then let go the break .Oh , my God . Oh , Jake , from a lake , nobody calls . You can do that . It nobody cause to give this performance and deliver acclaimed 40 miles per gallon either . But this one does that . People look down on the trip computer . I'm actually only averaging just over 31 balls per gallon . But still , don't forget this card up . They could launch , you know , whether is like that .On the whole , this TT is a very easy car to live with every day . A few problems with their fact that you did get quite that have brought the tires on a Bedouin wasn't speed from the wing mirrors .Another thing is that while the visibility at the front and the back is actually very good is easy to place the car . These pillars here are fatter than on quite a few cars and the fact that back as well he should have a good look around the cabin yourself . To mention this cause would be fine for you by clicking the top right hand corner of the screen on the car to watch out 300D degree video . Make sure you watch it on mobile . So you move the phone around to actually look at the card . It's pretty much as if you're in here with me .Okay , then overall , what ? Don't think of the Audi TT ?Well , it is rather expensive and the back seats are totally useless .But it's super desirable and brilliant to drive .If you click up there , you get more information and find out the best deal you can get on an Audi TT a car .

149,223,S Class,"It's not easy to critique a car you adore without coming off like a corporate shill . But then again , credit should be given where it's due . So brace yourselves for a love fest because the latest S class is nothing short of spectacular .What a car company tries to improve a product that already does everything right . The result is often regressive . Consider the next Generation s class a welcome exception . Mercedes-Benz preserved all that makes the S class so great while incorporating the most advanced technology available , Merck's flagship sedan also shuns the latest industry trend of pushing the limits of automotive electronics for the sake of appearing cutting edge .Okay , an integrated a room of therapy system is by no means essential . But this class is chockfull with amenities that chest dysfunctional is .They are easy to use . The Mercedes Command infotainment platform might not seem intuitive right off the bat , but it's one of the easiest systems to use once you get the hang of it .That to 12.3 inch high resolution displays are used for the instrument cluster and multimedia interfaces doesn't hurt either .There's also an optional hands free trumpet opens with the wave of a foot autonomous parallel parking , heated and cooled cupholders re a refrigerator box and the best surround view parking care we've ever tested .Snow belters and the chronically cold derive pleasure from a simulated hot stone massage , heated steering wheel and heated front and rear armrest .Given its competitive set , yes , class doesn't hold a monopoly on extravagance . But in this scrupulous world of luxury exotica , execution , reign , Supreme Mercedes and nearly flawless in this regard , every material in here is of the highest quality , constructed with impeccable attention to detail . And well , such is the case with most luxury cars . At this price point , Mercedes-Benz s class taste , comfort and opulence one step further and by one step further , we mean picking up where my bok left off .This'll ultra exclusive persona is particularly evident in the rear quarters where the s class serves up one of the swankiest passenger experiences this side of a private jet .Despite the fact our test car isn't fitted with the optional power operated foot and leg rests the rear seating areas still screams executive class , so much so that it warrants a Grey Poupon spoof . On second thought , that parody wasn't even funny in the nineties .So back to the rear seating area , which for the door buster fries around $8000 could be outfitted with foldout trade tables , detachable headrest pillows , seat belt mounted air bags and heated and cooled out for its seats .Shifting attention to the dynamic side of the equation . All S5 fifties air powered by a 4.6 liter turbocharged V8 that produces 449 horsepower and £516 feet of torque . That power is transmitted to the rear wheels or an optional all wheel drive system via standard seven speed automatic transmission , slightly more fuel efficient than its predecessor , the latest S5 50 is a bit quicker as well , boasting that claimed 4.8 seconds here to 60 time .That makes the high strung significantly more expensive , only slightly faster .S60 3 a.m. G . Variant .A tough sell emotion .Theo s Class delivers a driving experience once reserved for luxury cars with McMansion price tags .The cabin is so quiet that I find myself in inveterate Lee , popping my ears , doing sure haven't been stricken with some kind of inner ear infection , right quality borders on flawless , thanks in part to a 45 $100 ad on called Magic Body Control , which scans the road ahead using a stereoscopic camera to instantaneously adjust the air suspension and virtually eliminate body movement over dips and speed bumps .This is probably the coolest feature of experience in the last few years .Complaints , albeit of a trivial nature , are limited to an intrusive cruise control stock . Sluggish WiFi speeds and I guess that's it .As for pricing , Yes , 5 50 opens a chest under $94,000 which , despite a more extensive list of standard equipment , represents a $2000 price cut compared to the outgoing model .This roster of newly standard content includes a Burmester sound system , advanced voice recognition , soft closed doors , twin 12.3 inch LCDs and Ambien led lighting that transformed the cabin from classy to attack you with a turn of a dial .Notable add ons consist of a three D surround sound system , also by Burmester , Infrared night vision and Mercedes-Benz distraught Nick Active Safety Sweet , comprised of a full rein cruise control function that stops , starts and even steers the vehicle for you in high density traffic prepared to the Bentley Flying Spur and Rolls Royce Ghost .The newest s class offers a more contemporary feature set along with an equal measure of grandeur and prestige for less than half the cost .At the end of the day , the S class is perhaps the finest choice for affluent types .Have a love hate relationship with driving powerful engaging when you want it exceptionally refined when you don't .And while you can't go wrong with any luxury sedan at this price point , you'd be hard pressed to do better than the S class ."
150,224,CLA,"thistles . The C L A . It's Mercedes-Benz is entry level car . What should you know about it ? Let's start with how it drives .Powering the C . L . A . Is a four cylinder turbocharged engine paired with a seven speed double clutch transmission . Duo knocks out rapid near seamless gear changes and responsive powers . Only a hint of turbo lag floor from a stop C . L . A . Is quick enough to justify his racy looks , sprinting from 0 to 60 in a little S7 seconds .Given its spunky character , C . L . A . Is surprisingly efficient , returning an E p a estimated 38 miles per gallon on the freeway . Helping make that possible is a point to three drag coefficient . Perspective that's better than the Prius is point Q5 figure . It makes you wonder why they don't make sexier hybrids .Adding to the C . L . A's in town economy is an engine start . Stop system works pretty good , actually . When you take your foot off the brake , the engine restarts , but it's not too intrusive . Just a little vibration , a little sound . Small sacrifice for a good improvement in fuel economy power in the C . L . A . Is sent to the front wheels , which for some meat enthusiasts might be a problem .But I see it's a nonissue for two reasons . One to see L . A . It's plenty playful . Steering is quick and precise and engaging . And when you throw in the corners , you really , really have to be pushing it to feel that understeer that enthusiast hates so much in front drive cars .Point number to ask 10 people whether or not the car's air front or rear wheel drive . No seriously Ask him . I'd love to hear the responses . I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of them don't know or care , not unlike the vast majority of C . L . A . Buyers .That's right . Comfort the car . I'm driving in a little bit stiff but is also equipped with the sports package .Includes a sport suspension and high performance 18 inch tires . Regular car should ride a little bit better .Other observations . Brakes feel good with a nice firm pedal and wind noise at freeway speed .It's pretty quiet in here . Actually , it might have something to do with that 0.23 drag coefficient .Okay , so the C l . A drives . Well , there's more to a car than just road manners . The interior , for example . This might be the cheap Mercedes-Benz C . L .

151,225,A6,"the Audi A6 . Now it's quite hard to believe that this generation was actually first launched at the beginning of the decade , cause it's really stood the test of time better than some car of yours that there's me with . The original comment was first launched . Look at that . Well , you're full and stuff haven't A6 . Well , damn that . Okay , now , this guy's actually due for replacement very , very soon , but it still stands up well against its rivals .For instance , the boot . It's only this much smaller than the new Mercedes E Class . So in all that time Mercedes-Benz to find den X3 liters than I did so the boot itself , though , is actually really , really useful . Square shapes . It's Denny's is packed full of stuff in this , um , handy features you got tied down , Hawkes , you got some nets , obviously , off these Kamenetz tethering nets on .Also asked standard across the range , you get fold down rear seats . They have to come around to the back door to operate them on their own , split two ways rather than three way .But like I said , they are standard , which is a good thing when you're in the back of the A6 . There's sufficient room , decent knee room , lots of head room . People over six foot will be fine . The issue is when you try and fit three people in the back , so they see is quite wide . But this center console gets in the way . The large transmission tunnel on the family seat is quite high means that yet this car isn't great with three people in the back , and you can see what happened when we tried to fit three people in the back of this car . If you click on the card in the top , right hand corner of the screen , you know it's about to see how easy it is to fit a child , see in the back here and just hammered stuff we could squeeze into the A6 his boot .No , the front of the A6 , like the outside , has also stood the test of time . Very , very well . It still feels really upmarket . There's lots of nice styling accents about the place , and the quality is really strong . Also , send equipment is really impressive . So you get Zen owns .You get leather seat to get around parking sensors .You also get satnav and I should point out that this is the upgraded eight inch screen . You might like this if you want these people who don't like these screens that look a little bit stuck on the one in this A6 is retractable . Yes , the force is strong with this one . The only downside is is that the screen is starting to show its age a little bit , so the graphics a little bit low , def .The system isn't as good as out his latest system . You can see her full review of it by clicking on the top right corner of the screen on the card , and it also able to get a good look around this car's cabin .And what you really find out is that cubby spaces ? Well , there's not much space into there or there you can get while it's charging for your mobile phone . The glove box little bit tight , but the door bins are big enough for , well , unusually , a trainer rides OK , so moving quickly on Hero five core things about the Audi A6 S5 reinforced plastic suspension springs help reduce weight by 4.4 kilos . The optional 1200 what Bang Olufsen stereo has enough volume to fill a 2000 seater concert hall . You get the call with Wallace charging me and my well phone the antidote .So majors led headlines have 19 individual diets in them .You can connect it to a mobile devices that cost 40 wide by hot spot , the only issues that that requires a separate SIM card for the car .Which brings us on to some other annoying things about the A6 .The seven speed automatic gearbox kind of feel a bit jerky when doing low speed maneuvers , active cruise control and keeping a system blind .Spot monitoring are only available .It's part of a three and 1/2 grand technology pack .This seemingly useful shelf isn't quite deep enough to hold the calls .Heated front seats all standard across the range .Crummy control . Vince can be a bit tricky to use warning driving .Speaking of which , what is the A6 like when you hit the road when you bite in Audi A6 . You have to be a bit careful because most people like the sporty looking s line more black edition cars , but they get bigger wheels and stiffer suspension on that spoils the right . It makes it kind of fidgety and a bit jarring , so you got two options . What you can do is pay a lot of money and have the optional air suspension , which is good . Or you can stand your dealer to fit your car with a softer suspension on the S C model , and then it rides perfectly fine . It's comfortable enough . On the whole , it's quite nice car to traveling , so it's not too loud , really .You get their tire roar , but there's not much wind whistle on .Well , on the whole , it handles pretty well . Thing is right . It's a front wheel drive cars standard with this water engines . If you get a quadrille wheel drive version , it is more grippy . But it's never this A6 as much fun to drive as a BMW A5 .Siri's terms of engines . There's only one petrol available on it's a twin turbo four leads V8 in the rapid but thirsty S6 . The rest of the cars and all the diesels are very good . So this guy's most probably one . It's a two liter , and it's got 190 horsepower on Audi says that it should fail to return 65 miles per gallon . The district abuses were only getting 45 miles per gallon still is fell in their pay north , 60 takes just over eight seconds , and it's very responsive . This engineer put your foot down and it goes , That's It's smooth comes standard with a six speed manual gearbox , and the shift is quite like a bit naughty .But it's light , so to use the clutch on the steering that's like as well . And it's very responsive , which made this car actually quite agile and brilliant , just slipping through town traffic .And it does help the visit . But it is good , so you can see what's going on . The real problem is the fact that , well , the rear window is quite now right , and you can see for yourself what top right hand corner the screen on the card to watch a 360 degree video .OK , so overall , what I think of the Audi A6 well , the right is to firm with sport suspension on .It's not great carrying three people in the back , but the equipment is generous .Andi , it's diesel engines are excellent .Now , if you click on the top right corner of the screen , you get more information on this card .Find out the best deal you can count on Audi A6 a car .Wow dot co dot uk Thanks for watching .

152,226,SLS AMG,"If I say going doors , what do you think of if it's a DeLorean piloted by Marty McFly ?I That's understandable . But ask any true automotive connoisseur and the images almost certainly of a mid fifties Mercedes-Benz 300SL original going sports car Jump forward half a century . And we have this Mercedes-Benz sl S8 built as a 300SL spiritual successor s l s AMG bears a striking resemblance to the 300SL with its incredibly long hood , low greenhouse short rear deck lid .And , of course , the most striking feature on the SL S8 mgr . These going doors , you can see they open pretty easily . They don't take too much effort .And when they open their high enough so that you don't have any issues getting out the car Now , the real test with these doors and with how low the cars to the ground is whether or not you can pass the skirt and he'll test , I will show you how to do this so that you don't end up looking like a certain pop star . When you get him out of a vehicle , watch slide in bringing the legs bring down the door with essence .SL s AMG is the ultimate Mercedes-Benz . It's the brand's answer . Two cars like the Audi R8 and the Lexus L . F A .With wings like doors is the inspiration . It only makes sense . The SL s feature an airplane were the cockpit . It's a car made to fly metaphorically . But think Gulfstream instead of Airbus inside the SL s AMG , you'll find a number of unique features . For one , this jet thruster like gear selector , these jet engine like air events and an abundance of aluminum notice the jet theme going on . You'll still find Mercedes-Benz luxury touches like designer leather seating , soft Calcaterra clad surfaces and contrast stitching the S L S A .M G is supercar , but it's actually more of a GT or grand touring car because , as you can see , there's actually room in the cargo area for a considerable amount of luggage .But intriguing design , while an important part of the equation , isn't what makes a car , there's got to be something special moving those eye catching wheels .Six foot long hood sits a 6.3 liter , naturally aspirated V8 produces 563 horsepower and £479 feet of torque . This engine falls under MG is one man , one engine policy , which means that it from start to finish . One man does the entire job . See , Robert Filer built the engine powering our test car . 6.3 liter engine itself is exclusive to the S . L s and is matched to a new AMG rear mounted seven speed double clutch transmission .Yes , the less AMG is by no means a slow car . However , for being a super car and having a seven speed double clutch transmission , it seems to shift a little slower than you would have thought .You'll get the most out of this car by putting the transmission into manual mode , keeping the rpm's around 5000 in anticipating your next year . That corner ahead , the one you'd like to be sure you're in second year for Yeah , you'll have to plan for it .Job throttle from a stop and the car hesitates , then lurches forward . Not so attractive in a car that's noticeable and not so great in a car that Mercedes-Benz says could be your daily driver . You really have to feather the froth quibbles about shift quality side .I'm completely enamored supercar sounds that emanate from the S L s refine what you'd expect from a Mercedes . It's like a show tiger that lives out his days in Vegas . Instead of living out in the open , you know what has to actually hunt for its own food with its front , mid engine and rear mounted transmission , and has a 47 53 front rear weight distribution couple .This with a double wishbone sport suspension . Low center of gravity , responsive steering . An extensive use of lightweight aluminum . It's a Mercedes-Benz supercar . So what would you expect ? It's approachable for the common driver who could afford it .For those interested in approaching or exceeding the SL s is limits . Stability control can be partially defeated but not turned off completely . But considering how tempting it is to drive this car fast , that might be a good thing .Powers put pavement via lightweight 19 inch wheels in front and 20 inch wheels in the back and to ensure optimum grip obsolescence .Continental tires were designed exclusively for AMG .When it's time to stop to peace , grooved invented disc brakes with six piston calipers in the front , four piston calipers in the rear . And yes , it stops fast , faster than it will take someone to comment on this video . If you need to stop any faster , you could offer the ceramic great package .How much will this luxo supercar set you back ? A cool 183,000 the start . That's certainly more than the Audi R8 , but substantially less in the Lexus lf A8 or any of the offerings from Ferrari or Lamborghini . So what ? Does that kind of cash value perfection ? No . Then again , good luck finding a supermodel without some quirks .183 large buys you is a taste of Mercedes-Benz heritage and a glimpse of its future , packaged in an automobile that delivers exceptional performance , soul stirring , exhausting , gorgeous interior and stunning looks .You know all the things you want from supercar .

153,227,GLC,"small SUVs are the fastest growing segment in the luxury space . This is the GLC , a small SUV from Mercedes-Benz , now with the largest target on its back . No , no , no , no , it's just an expression . So let's find out why .From a visual standpoint , the GLC is effortlessly beautiful , suddenly exhibiting an air of contemporary elegance without shoving it down your throat . Him . And while it may be longer and wider than its predecessor , the GLC is more than £170 lighter .A difference . You can feel out on the road , the best word to describe the driving experience . Butter .The cabin is actually quieter than that of its four door stablemate , which is already very quiet .And sightlines are excellent in every direction except up fromthe steering to the brakes to ride quality to a turning raiders that would put some compacts a dance to shame . The GLC is an absolute joy to Dr Bless . It's down to have some fun when you are really the only criticism we have is with the intermittently naci gear .Changes produced by the nine speed automatic connected to that middling gearbox is a two litre turbo charged four cylinder good for 241 horsepower in £273 feet of torque . Buyers have the option of routing that power to the rear wheels for free or all four for an extra $2000 . Our real world feel economy figures largely mirror those of the D A , though efficiency aficionados will likely take an interest in the all wheel drive only GLC 300D in its 2.1 litre Turbo diesel , or GLC 3 50 e plug in hybrid , which can travel roughly 20 miles on battery power alone before the gasoline engine kicks in . It might be a bona fide green machine , but the three fifties impressive output figures , the Fords and serious straight line acceleration .At the top of the performance pyramid lies the GOC 43 which as an AMG tuned air suspension , rear biased for Matic all wheel drive system and three liter bi turbo V six that turns out 362 horsepower in £384 feet of torque . I think that's all of them . Oh , right . There's also a serious production hydrogen model on the way , followed closely by a six variant that's powered by magnets or something we can only assume .With that out of the way , it's time to switch our focus inside . Beyond expected refinements like cushy arm rest , high rez displays , premium trim , you get the idea . It's the subtle nuances that win us over . The events make this satisfying click when return to the center position .The head rests , are well padded and adjust for a raft and ranking highest in my book materials quality . And not just in the usual places , like the upper dash and upper door panels , but soft touch surfaces on the lower door panels and lower dashes . Well , something that can't be said for some consciously your mid size SUVs .The centerpieces Mercedeses embrace infotainment system .Both the standard seven inch or optional 8.4 inch high rez displays are operated via traditional rotary dial , nestled below an ergonomically shaped touch pad that recognizes single and multi finger gestures . Such a scrolling , swiping and zooming , although there is a slight learning curve at first embrace becomes is pleasant to use as it is the look at after only a few days of practice .GLC is also a master of the pragmatic arts offering an abundance of rear leg room in headroom for outboard passengers , along with numerous storage next , including a handy compartment below the cargo floor .Pulling the seat release buttons produces a completely flush load floor free of annoying gaps and protrusions .And if the front seats are positioned too far back for the rear seats to fold flat , the front seats will move forward automatically .Of course , rear quarters aren't perfect as evidence by a pronounced center tunnel and fixed rear seatbacks pricing , believe it or not , is actually one of the GOC strong suits for about $40,000 including destination fees .An entry level glc C300 comes well furnished with goodies like a power liftgate , rain sensing windshield wipers , A5 driving modes , including an individual setting , a supremely comfortable 14 way driver seat with extendable by support and three position memory . Nine airbags , a backup camera .And it eats speaker audio system with two USB ports at in high end trappings like adaptive cruise control , leather heating in ventilated front seats , heated steering wheel lane , keeping assist with blind spot detection and V8 interior lighting .Burmester premium audio in full led headlights with active corner lamps and the price jumps to a still respectable $52,000 that again going all in with exclusive nappa leather head up display navigation linked to a 360 degree parking system , panoramic moon roof and dramatic air suspension We don't recommend , due to its spotty reliability record and negligible performance benefits inflates the sticker price to chest over $60,000 .Similarly priced alternatives like the Audi Q5 and BMW X3 can't match the GOC when it comes to standard feature content . Nor can the less expensive Lincoln and Casey and Lexus and X 200 T .And on the other hand , value conscious buyers who couldn't care less about image or prestige might express a preference for the impressively well rounded , accurate already X1 but essentially tops out where the GLC begins .But unlike Mercedes-Benz products of your , the GOC is expected to retain some of the highest residual values among compact luxury SUVs .Virtually every luxury SUV in this class is just that luxurious , but the GOC takes the qualities of comfort and refinement just one step further , and considering it's a decent value , the GOC is currently the one to be"
154,228,GLE,"picking up where the M L left off the G l E is Mercedes-Benz to row midsize SUV .So how is it it's very much a Mercedes , starting with what you experience from the driver's seat ? The steering and the brakes are both light and squishy . Kind of like a Nerf football . A lot of cars that'll be a major complaint . But in a suburban dwelling , Mercedes-Benz feli , soft , disconnected steering is kind of a plus .Adding to the G Eli's easy driving nature is a well controlled ride on a welcoming interior .Peek around and you'll find premium materials perfectly in line with Mercedes .Upscale image , spacious front and rear seating and a generous 38.2 cubic feet behind the rear seats .Having driven some very well engineered small SUVs , dropping the seats in the G L E spent of a letdown , you'll notice there are no releases in the rear cargo area , meaning I have to walk around the side , flip up the seat bottom , and then I have to risk my right hand on this awkwardly place release . Pull it out before it gets crushed by the sea following down . My parents had a 1986 Toyota four runner When I was a kid , when I dropped the seats in the back of that thing , it's kind of the same deal .While we're at it , let's toss out a few more complaints . Fix side pillars in the high beltline hurt outward visibility .Oh God , the sun visors don't extend and the automatic engine shut off occasionally engages while you're still creeping . Go , stop .I mean , it's subtle , but it's a thing that happened and given the size of the G l E whiter side mirrors , but actually kind of nice . No idea what's going on over there .Course . Those are just details collected . Whole still exudes a rich premium aura that aura seems worth possessing . Get some decisions to make since the G l E forms .There's a base 3.5 liter V six in the G l E 3 50 A3 liter turbocharged V six in the G l E400 Ace . Lawful but fairly efficient 2.1 leader Turbo Diesel four cylinder in the G l E 300D a G l E 5 50 e for Matic , plug in hybrid A5 500.5 Later V8 in the a . M . G . G . L E 63 a sassy your version of the same engine in the G l E 63 s . All right , all GLK350 ing seven speed automatic transmission and all wheel drive for the Base V six , whose standard rear wheel drive accounts for a reduced tow rating in line with the diesel £6600 max . Interestingly , with all wheel drive , all three gasoline engines share an identical £7200 tore A8 .Just make things even more complicated . There's also a G l E Coop . Yeah , I know it has four doors built to compete with BMWs . X6 G L jettisons the proper G L A D in the name of style .Coop also comes with all wheel drive turbocharged V six Port turbo charged V8 engine and price tags ranging from roughly $66,000 to more than $120,000 . And if you can swing $120,000 for a Mercedes coupe , just know this baby is only about 10 grand , more ranging from around $52,000 including destination to more than $125,000 . The Mercedes-Benz G l E exists in the same price . Domain is the BMW X5 .Extend your SUV search beyond Germany , however , and you can nab five passenger luxury SUVs like the Lexus RX , Cadillac X5 , Infinity Q X 70 and the excellent Volvo XC90 and eating five or seven passenger guys for substantially less . The three row , accurate MDX is another , less expensive alternative off the three row Audi .Q7 offers more seating flexibility than the G L E , approximately the same price .Stick with the most frugal G L E 3 50 you'll enjoy a power lift gate sunroof , dual zone climate control , heated front seats , rain sensing windshield wipers on eight inch display , nine air bags and a radar based forward collision warning system . All lovely stuff but the lack of a standard backup camera . It's a pretty big oversight .Spend an extra $3800 for the Premium one package and you'll get that back up camera along with navigation , blind spot monitoring and kilos entry and engine start .I know it betrays a lifestyle of privilege , but there's something really annoying about having to reach in your pocket .Unlock and start your $52,000 Mercedes .Yeah , other worthwhile .Add ons include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection lane keep assist , dynamic cruise control with full stop abilities , automatic parking assist , a lovely Bang and Olufsen audio system and an off road package with two speed transfer case , locking differential and optional air suspension that facilitates 11 inches of ground clearance , which I'm sure you'll fully exploit in the Costco parking lot among luxury five passenger SUVs .There might be better choices , and there are certainly better values .But if you love Mercedes-Benz SUV and you're willing to pay a premium for a vehicle , that's both of those things . The G l E should make you happy ."
155,229,AMG C 63,"Hi .I'm Micha Museo , video road test editor for Kelley Blue Book , and this car is faster than yours . Don't believe me . Check this out . A MG badge means that this sea Siri's isn't just a regular See Siri's . It's the AMG C 63 . It's soon by AMG . That's Mercedes-Benz is all powerful performance tuning division . Still don't believe it's Fashion your car .Wait .So might be presumptuous of me to assume that your car is not as fast as this car . But odds are , if your car has more than 451 horsepower , you're either too busy wrenching on it or commanding your business empire to watch this video power for the C 63 comes from a 6.3 liter V8 , and that's pumping out again .451 horsepower . Resulting performance . Let's see 0 to 60 time is about 4.3 seconds , and it'll do 186 miles per hour if you got it and you have a long stretch of open road before we move along from the engine . Not to be forgotten is the fantastic sound of the V8 Florida , and along with that acceleration is that glorious V8 exhaust note . It's awesome , Which is good , because the iPod connector for the stereo sucks .Distinguishing the C 63 from the regular See Siris are aggressive front were faces and little events that are functional foot blisters that are not not that I care . It still looks pretty cool . In fact , I think it looks a lot like a German touring car . Let's see if my German you know , German in high school , these an auto it is stare xun wunderbar . Right now my German teacher is rolling in his grave .His dad has a habit of doing this full top to bottom makeover when they to one of the Mercedes-Benz products . In the case of the C 63 they've gone to a lot of effort . With this front , suspension is almost fully redesigned . It's about a 1.4 inch wider track . The rear track is about 0.4 inches wider , and the results is really impressive . Handling things just clings to the road , great steering feel , and then it's not that uncomfortable . Just driving around day today way .Standout features in the C 63 are these seats . I'm not going anywhere , no matter how hard a corner . Although a little bit of a downside , these bolsters air so bold that you can't really move your arms . So if you have really height corners , sometimes they restrict your mobility a little bit .I have to admit I'm a recovering manual transmission elitist , but there's been a couple of cars that have come around recently that have really changed my mind on transmissions minus a clutch number one being the Nissan GT R . I mean , that's a great transmission and the other one being the seven speed automatic transmission here in the C 63 got these paddle shifters and the ship's air so quick and the downshift or even smoother , listen seamless and upshift . Yeah , that's our transmission . I work even if my left was doing nothing .Transmission has three . Moz . There's a comfort setting . There's a sport setting with even faster shifts , and then there's a manual mode where you can control the ship's V8 . These paddle shifters right here on the steering wheel .Everybody gets caught up with the engine of the C 63 but almost as impressive are the brakes got 14.2 intruders in the front 13 rear A6 calibers front and wins . This time , I'll demonstrate . How will a Braves breaking can be fun , too ?There's no power and you're right , but that you turned out to stability control . You can treat the C 63 like your own drift machine . Now , of course , that's dependent on you being a talented driver slash somebody who doesn't mind losing their job . If you make a mistake , I have neither .That the C 63 is about the same price is the BMW M3 and the Lexus I . S F . It's a full $14,000 less expensive than the Audi RS4 , but has one shortcoming . Its fuel economy get about 12 miles per gallon in the city in about 19 on the highway , so it's gonna be a huge drain on your fuel budget . On the other hand , for a drain , it's pretty enticing drain . So if you wanna waste fuel , this is probably one of the best ways to do it . In fact , I'm gonna go away some more fuel right now .More automotive news Please visit the latest news section of k b v dot com ."
156,230,A7,"welcome to Cape Town in South Africa for the launch of the all new second generation Audi A7 sport back .So this is a colors designed to combine Call Coop a locks with limousine like luxury .Actually , with that in mind , let's start with how comfortable this car is to travel in this new A7 sport . Back definitely feels a little bit more roomy in the rear than the old Carson . Look , I'm fine back here , people over six foot much because headroom is still a bit on the tight side because of that sloping roof . But it's okay , and you can chill out .Pull this down and do you have the best storage into there if you want in there some cup holders hair . I like the fact that you've got digital controls for the climate back here . So look , you just slide the touch sensitive controls so that the temperature you want . You've also got some USB imports and 12 volt charge of mobile devices on its quiet as well , so this particular car is fitted with the acoustic glass and serene back .It's all very nice on you can get four different types of suspension , so there's normal suspension . The sport suspension there is adaptive suspension . And then there's the top of the range air suspension , which is what this car has , and for the most part it's really nice . It floats along over undulations , gives the course sophisticate feel to it . There is one thing , though , when you hit on it like an expansion gap in a motorway , a pothole or small bump . It just sent a jolt through the cards . It's really order to shock , so it's like bang . And sometimes over rough roads , you can feel it just fidgeting around . It just kind of it just breaks the ambience . Now that is something that's not helping with that .So this car is riding on 20 inch alloy wheels . You character getting 20 ones , but they will make the right even worse . It's possible to get 19 inches , but really , with a car like this , look at the design of it . You are gonna want the larger wills to really show off .That cool , swooping bodywork is a great looking car . I was actually at the launch of the original Audi A7 Sport , but back in 2011 now I don't look as good in 2018 . But this call definitely does . It's It's a really good evolutionary design which has worked . It's not boring . It just looks really sharp , really nice . I really like the light bar across the back , obviously being a sport back .It is a hatchback , so you get a decent sized boot . It's more practical than a saloon , of course , because that huge liftback tailgate , but it's not quite as practical as an estate car , but it does look better than in a state car .Now , if you click on the public banner on the top right corner of the screen , you can vote whether you think this car looks better than a Mercedes C . L s the new version or BMW A6 . There is grand . Keep a now . There are some things I don't like about this car's design . Just a couple one is this . I wish Audi would quit using these fake exhaust actual Alec for the exhaust pipe is underneath . There's any threat now . It is a design treatment , and I won't boy with waffle about the other design characteristics , such as the character lines and the various graphics on the car . That's just that's just designed mumbo jumbo . But another thing . That noise may all these vents here . So this side Bree that does actually let air in there on down over the wheel for improved aerodynamics . But the rest of this here it's all just blacked out . It's It doesn't do anything that's annoying . Why bother with that ? Is a pretty enough car as it is . I really like the big gorillas work , and I like the fact that it's just one piece , just this frame around it that is actually mimicked by part . The trim inside the car on the dash . Now there are some things hit in the grill that is raid on a laser for the cars or Thomas Driving Tech . Yeah , it's a real smart looking thing .Price has gone up since 2011 though , so this car now start around �55,000 if you click on the pop up in the top right hand corner the screen on the link below the video , you can get a car away to see how much you could save on a new car . This particular car , but here , though , is quite a bit more expensive because it's fully loaded with kit , for instance , you can get three different kinds of lights in this car .You can get it with just normal . Led is you could get matrix early days on these ones , which actually laser lights for a super high beam on these lights do a really cool thing when you turn them off . And on that , I'm gonna need to go somewhere slightly darker to show you that I'm concerned . Underground car park . I want to show you some of the cool lighting animations you can get with this car . So when you turn it off and get out , which is exactly what I'm gonna do now , maybe get . And as you walk away from the car , you will see that the lights are on to guide you safely to your front door . But when you lock it , look the Colin , I give it a second and the lights will do a little dance . Once you're safely at your front door . There you go . Now , if I unlock the car again , will do the opposite and I'm gonna walk around the back because you get another lighting animation around at the back . So here we go , my locket and then find luck . It will do the opposite .A6 . It's kind of dark in here . I'm also gonna show the interior ambient lighting on this car because there's so much you can do with it Now .I'm just going to the menu of the infotainment system , and then I could control the There is lighting functions such as background lighting the inside , and I can control it for various parts of the car . So , for instance , look , there's all these different colors to choose from . I could get individual and I can change it . I can change the surfaces . Look , there's all these different colors here . Let's go from this red color . Let's go to blue surfaces . Look at that . It's got to sneak a little bit lighter , the green color , and then I can change the foot well as well . On and off . If I wanted to go for maximum brightness , which I'm on , go back , go for the contours , the color of the controls so you can see that's in red There with the Quattro Budge . It's pretty cold . I got blue and also the center console you'll see , or the blue lighting green in the door .He just makes a match with the red for a bit of a burlesque . The mmm . But purposely Well , uh , it really does help make the inside this car just feel that big . Cool him in at night . So lit up . It was really expensive when you just cruising around in the dark . Okay , so I do love this entertainment screen . It looks fabulous , high definition , and it's super fast as well . The process in is really , really quick . The problem is that while it may have haptic feedback , So when I press a button , get clicks . Oh , no . If pressed it , you can actually feel your way to the buttons because there's no physical buttons . So you having to look down to operate it ? And I just don't think it's as good to use when you're driving a CZ . The old fashioned an M . I swivel Will that used to get in the old A7 . Now it doesn't matter so much because you have the virtual copy a standard Z4 digital dolls there , and you can operate things on the phone media system and various trip functions through it and go full widescreen for the satnav . If you want to It's great . The problem comes when you want to use the climate control . So rather than having like dolls again , it's another touch screen down here . And you really do have to take your eyes off the road to see it to set the temperature you want . I don't like that I think is a bad idea . Thankfully , the voice commands a pretty good , so set temperature to 19 degrees .I'll increase the temperature to 19.0 precise , the one decimal point that was pretty good . Okay , so the system actually is connected to the cloud , so it's really good in terms of its voice recognition . But let's see if you can understand a strong Midlands accent so set temperature to 25 degrees .I'll increase the temperature to 25.0 . It even understands broom ese .Now that particular car I'm driving here is fitted with four wheel steering , so at low speeds it can turn the back wheels five degrees in the opposite direction of the front wheels , and that should make it super maneuverable . There's big , long car , but I can still weave in and out of car parking spaces fairly easily without worrying about catching my big alloy wheels on the Cubs . I feel like a much smaller car . That means you don't need to do quite so much wheel twirling . We're deciding where the heck should I park ? Yeah , well , I'm not sure about you . That's not right . I didn't think . Let's get up here again . I just can't decide .It's really helpful , actually , looking up .Amazing , right ? Let's talk about the interior design of this new A7 sport back . So this car salesman of its parts with the A8 Saloon , but inside a slightly different so you'll notice that the central part of the dash is angled towards the driver . On this , combined with the center console , which separates you from the passenger helps make it feel more sporting . Generally , quality is just the same a Z8 , so this wood veneer appear feels good . This this metal area here is all very nice and the shiny plastic , which undoubtedly will scratch it for a while or looks good . We've got leather material appear on the dash is well , what's not so great , though , is this . Look , this area for the vents , it's just plastic . It feels a little bit cheap on the A8 That's a wood veneer on events actually appear when you turn the car on the rotate forward at the dash . Now I found another cheap plastic Dona that scratchy . Just shame , because the rest of the daughter is lovely . Andi , there's another piece just here , there as well on . Yeah , that's the only problem , because otherwise this is a very , very nice cabin as well . Look at it . Steals lovely on just like the A8 .You have door handles , which operate like a switch .They don't deport me , just fill out the door , opens and then when you shut the door , it's got soft clothes , so it shuts the door for you . And , of course , being the A7 , you have frameless windows . So look , when I put the window down and then open the door , you will see you have no door frame on order .That just makes this car feel a bit more sporting . A bit more coop a like let's talk about the driving tech fit to this car . So , as you can see , it has lain . Keeping assessed so well actually steer the court to keep in lane , and when you combine that with the radar laser guided cruise control , which can keep you safe distance from the car in front of this car come pretty much drive itself . Also , it uses all the sensors around the car to get feel what's going on around it . So if you suddenly go through roadworks , it can still navigate through the lanes . Obviously , you can't drive for too long with the hands off the wheel . It will throw a wobbly and tell you to put hands back on . That's what it's doing now . So I do it , it says , because he shouldn't do that really should do .Another thing this car has is mold hybrid technology . So you've got a 48 volt battery fit into this thing on it allows it to coast . So when you on the motorway , you can lift off the throttle on this thing , we're pretty much free wheel . It d couples the engine from the wheels on you just roll along on that helps save fuel , as does the fact that the stop start system will actually stop the engine when you're coming to a standstill . So he doesn't wait for you to actually stop . It senses you're slowing down , and it just cuts the engine . This particular car is the three liter V six days or it's got 286 horsepower north , sixth day in around 5.7 seconds . And it's a really nice , smooth , strong engine , so there's layers of pulling power definitely suits this car very well . You can also get it from launch with a three liter V six Twin turbo petrol , which has more horsepower but less talk so it doesn't suit it . What as well as this engine A4 mpg is apparently possible . Interesting thing is that when you have this current dynamic mode hit out noise , I'm sure it's playing fake engine zone through the speakers and I don't like it . Things will rattle either , but I hate those fake engine sounds in terms of the rest of the driving experience .While this is a big heavy car , but don't rip the road well , obviously got cuatro four wheel drive that all well steering system fit to this car . When you get in faster , the wheels of the back actually turned in the same direction as the front wheels to give you a bit more stability , and it does . It handles very well , there's not too much role . My only complaint really is a steering . I mean , it's sharp enough and it's accurate enough . It just seems a little bit weird . Almost almost like you're playing a computer game . It is that the steering wheel isn't really connected to the front wheels . It's money complaint really on that prevents it feeling truly fun to drive . Do you care in a car like it's more about the luxury on anyway ? Something like a BMW six years Gran coupe or Mercedes-Benz isn't exactly fun to drive , either . Yes , this is very good for getting from A to B and perfect luxury . We're looking very cool .So then , what's the verdict on the new Audi A7 sport back ? Well , I'm not yet totally sold on the new touch screen entertainment system . Also , their suspension on this car it can jolt over really sharp bumps on . It's not a sport , his car to drive , you know , all that is a small price to pay for something that looks this .

157,231,GLA 250,"What we have here is the Mercedes-Benz G l A . To 50 goes up against other subcompact luxury crossovers like the BMW X1 and Audi A3 . Yes , subcompact Luxury crossover is a thing , Really ? The question need to ask me looking something like the G l A Is , is it any good ?Yes . The answer is yes . Wait . Hold on the same platform and sharing its power train with the entry level C l A sedan . The G l A is both small and a joy to drive .First , let's address the small part . Rear seat headroom Certainly better than the C l . A . But I'm five foot 10 and just barely brushes up against the headliner over here in the right seat . If you move to the middle , it's a little bit better . But you do have a center tunnel that you need to think about . If headroom is a major priority for you , be sure to claw your way to the roomier and more comfortable front seats .Mercedes-Benz G L A N s u B . But without a commanding view or exceptional cargo space , it's really a tall hatchback .17.2 cubic foot cargo area is larger than a BMW X1 or Audi Q3 , but actually smaller than a Mazda three hatch . Dropping the back seats creates a 42 cubic foot expanse about five cubic feet less than the X1 Q3 and the previously mentioned Masa A3 hatchback . Being small does have its advantages , however . A tidy 173.9 inch overall length helps urban pioneers easily slot the G L . A . In the tight downtown parking spots . Johnson to the single Origin Coffee roaster or locally sourced Butcher slash sandwich joint just got easier .Yon park ability GLK350 wonderfully its sense of refinement , and it's pretty quiet in here . And yet at the end of your long , tedious commutes , when that's beautiful , off ramp is gleaming on the horizon from some fun . I mean , it's fun . Yeah , yeah , fun For even more agility , turn tvg F40 5 a.m. G . With its lower , stiffer suspension and big breaks including 13.8 inch disks up front , it's a more thrilling way . G L .Enhancing the thrills are standard all wheel drive , 19 inch AMG wheels shot and grippy summer tires , aggressive exterior styling raced out interior and a presumably sport of your gear shift .It replaces the base cars covered cup holder .Just remember , this aggression carries with it a noticeably firmer ride and a base price around $49,000 .The basic G L A . To 50 puts out 208 horsepower , while the G L . A 45 has 305 horses to work with . Let's see what that means from the driver's seat . 321 on their 60 was fun .I had fun , too .We like the seven speed dual clutch transmission that's found in all GLX . S4 are quicker , smoother dual clutch is out there . Porsche and VW come to mind . Also , thanks to some turbo lag , acceleration from a stop can feel uneven in the turbo does come online . Sudden power hit is especially pronounced in the powerful G . L A4 G5 Turbo quibbles aside , GT-R delivers a good balance of power and efficiency .Well , Dr G . L . A . To fifties returning highway efficiency in the low thirties . Realistically , the G L . A . Is made for tarmac for feeling bold . We all will drive . GLK350 four Matic does include eight inches of ground clearance , Standard Hill Descend Control and the ability to send 50% of available torque to the rear wheels when needed .Just saying for slightly more than $34,000 including destination , you can nab a G L A to 50 with all wheel drive , 18 inch wheels , a power lift gate , M B text , faux leather , 14 way memory front seats and Collision Assistance Plus , which uses radar to detect an impending crash on automatically apply the brakes . Prime options to ponder include blind spot warning lane departure prevention navigation with a seven inch display that replaces the standard 5.8 inch unit and key list entry with push button Start . Because even though it sounds entitled , we're kind of over reaching into our pockets to unlock the doors of luxury cars .Based G . L . A . Pricing lines up with the BMW , X1 and Audi Q3 , but budget conscious buyers might consider the $25,000 near luxury Buick Encore . Conversely , expanding your budget by only a few $1000 could move you up from a G l A .To a much roomier Acura RDX or Lexus nxe Mercedes-Benz GLK350 styled . It drives great . Assuming something this small meets your needs , the G l . A might be a fun fit"
158,232,S4,"If you've seen my review of the ninth Generation A4 , then you know I hold in high regard . In the case of the up tuned S4 , Audi has done something most automakers continually fail to do with a car like this increase performance or retaining the virtues of the conventional car .Yes , for does just that and war on the topic of Maur We only had a few bones to pick with the A4 rock hard , the rest grabby break field and generally Laghi throttle response , all of which have been addressed with the S4 .In fact , throttle response after giving the shifter a light tap into sports , is what makes this car such a hoot to drive Booth the right most pedal in the three litre turbocharged V six springs in action with virtually no hesitation and yes , E350 four horsepower , £369 feet of torque in A4 3690.3 seconds . Here , S60 are all well and good , but they don't tell the whole story here . The real magic comes when you combine that throttle response with a hugely expansive tour curve . Okay , I'll get on the gas heart of just 2000 rpm . Look , was pushed to the back of the scene . Power continues to build in such a linear , non dramatic way that this is a car that could get you into trouble .If you're not watching the speedometer like you do your phone beyond Omni President Power , the S4 placate your practical side with a little help from supremely comfortable 12 way front seats with adjustable side bolsters anti extensions . A well hushed cabin .When the exhaust isn't set to look at me mode and surprisingly decent fuel economy with a real world score of 32.4 mpg on the highway , he significantly more powerful S4 . She's only S6 mpg loss compared to the A4 . Better yet , this everyday practicality doesn't stop it . Fuel economy .But when Wright heighten all the S4 is more aggressively tuned . Suspension still feels nearly as complaint is that of the standard A4 . That doesn't mean it's a slouch in the handling department , either , thanks in part to sharp steering reflexes , and he smartly calibrated Quattro , a drive system that apportions 40% of available power to the front wheels and 60 to the rear . In other words , going fast on the S4 doesn't require a great deal of car control . So if you want to go fast but have no intention of acquiring the skills to do so , this might be the work around you've been looking for .And with the starting price of just under $52,000 including destination fees , there's never been a more affordable way the blast through corners with minimal effort .At that price , you'll also get full led headlights , moon roof , leather and Alcon Terrace .Eating service is complete with heated front seats , A4 drive modes , including a customizable individual setting , a 19 speaker banging old son audio system and intuitively designed , seven inch , remote operated media center with the backup camera and Android auto and apple carplay integration and an eight speed automatic transmission . Yes , you heard right . The S4 ditches . The A4 is more sophisticated dual clutch auto box for a traditional A8 speed unit . But the news isn't all bad because this transmission is really good .It's moving around town and upshift times V8 the paddle shifters nearly as quick as those of the twin clutch . There was a slight hesitation on down ships , and before you ask , a manual transmission is not available .Getting back to pricing , Leaving goodbye to $65,000 gets you out his virtual cockpit .A larger , 8.3 inch main display with embedded navigation heated steering wheel that replaces the standard flat bottom assembly .And Audi is pre safe technologies comprised of all speed adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist lane departure assist , automatic collision breaking and blind spot monitoring with cross traffic alert .So if you're not quite smitten with the S4 , what else should you consider ? Well , how about the rear drive BMW 3 40 I , which features a slightly less powerful three liter turbocharged engine but could be paired with a traditional six bead manual gearbox ?And then there's the Mercedes AMG C 43 with a similar starting price .Comparable output figures , standard rear biased all wheel drive and an equally gorgeous interior .See , 43 is a serious contender to the Audi , but the S4 is perhaps the only car in this class that could behave like a legitimate luxury sedan around town and then instantly transformed into a proper sports car when the mood strikes . To put it another way , it isn't just a higher performing A4 . It's a better one"
159,233,A4,"This is the Audi A4 event , and it's the perfect coffee of modern raft for wearing middle class cyclists because you know it's got the image it's got the locks on .Of course , it's got the space to put your bike into the boot . But I'm not a cyclist because I'm gonna tell you about this car . So wait for the automated Tell Kate to do its thing . The space you got there is gonna be big enough for most people . It's not God's larger , say , a box . I confer Satya state , but yet it's not bad at all . Now carry your suitcases and stuff that you do have a bit of a lip to lift stuff over , though it's not too bad because you got this male scuff plate there , which is handy under here , Got a space Avis bear ? Well , it's not false floor that he can't lift it up , but it's not to buy their awesome nice features such as WeII , the Parcel shelf . It slides about the way when you open the boot on is easy to remove . Just one simple catch . It's gone . The features we got in here are 12 watt socket there we've got some curry hawks . There's also these rails where you can have some other tethering hooks , then slide them backwards and forwards . You notice any delighting in the book as well , which is pretty smart . Now I can fall down these seats three way , So if we want to carry longer items in two people , the center seat falls down on its own . I can fold down the other seats , putting these levers here , but I can to release them . You don't have to lean in and push the seat back , which is a bit of a pain . Let's do this one on the top catch instead , and then you've got a fairly continuous flat lobe . A second slide . Heavy items right to the front , though the seats do still stick up . So it's not completely flat , but it's not that big a problem . Anyway .Let's move on to the back seats . So actually , it was pretty good quality that there's noise and heavy and solid locks into place firmly , that's expect from an Audi now space in the back .Yeah , I've got plenty of room . This seat is in my usual driving position . Lots of knee room , lots of heaven because that square a body than the salute people over six foot will be fine in the back of this car in terms of carrying three , though it's not so good . This middle seat is a little bit small on you got this big transmission tunnel here on this console as well , in the way . So yes , the middle seat , not that comfortable . And the body isn't quite as wide as you might think it is .So you can feel the squeeze with three adults in the back and looking into him that the arm rest int nothing else .Just want to see more on this car's practicality . Click up there just one detail practicality , video . You'll see how much stuff we can fit into this car's boot . How you compare a bike in there without taking the world's off , which is important .Remember on how easy it is to fit a child .Seat on actually brings onto cubby spaces , so this plenty here in this car so the the door bins can take a big bottle . I'll use that to move into the front of the car , so yes , quickly , I'll just show you that you got big door bins here as well .Now this car it starts from �28,000 is rather expensive . If you click it there to get a call , why don't u k u n about offers from dealers ? By price ? Your confidence said when average people save �3800 on New Car Carlo .Now this is a car that does feel very , very upmarket . I mean , just take a look at the design . The interior design is lovely . It's faultless . On quality is exemplary this car from the fields posturing side than its key rivals from Mercedes and BMW . Not too squidgy plastics about the place solid feel to it . It's it's lovely .And there's this Features like this as well . The way you've got these , the climate control dials , actually , How's the temperatures ? I mean , it's really , really nice . You also got three zone climate control in the frontier on this one has the upgraded entertainment system Sara Stanley get S7 screen . This is the bigger one , and you get a faster process as well .It's all that easy to use .The system's slick as I absolutely love it , and you can have Internet connectivity and use Google Maps , and this one goes one better by having Audi is virtual cockpit . I mean , look at that .You got digital dart in front of you and I can cycle through different menus . There we go on , have full widescreen mapping . I love it . That is worth an upgrade . Now , if you click it there , you can see my detailed entertainment video review and see how well the system works .So that's what the practical stuff dealt with . Now let's see what this car is like to drive .Buying an A4 of that can be a bit of a confusing business , because the 70 choice of engine suspension setups , transmissions and all that kind of stuff .So let's just start with the engines . Now you can get from a one point for a turbo petrol , which is really , really good , actually , to A3 that V six turbo petrol , which could get from naught to 60 in under five seconds , makes people want a diesel on . You can get two litre diesel CZ 1 50 horsepower or 1 90 horsepower on this is the 1 90 supposed to do around 61 miles per gallon .I'm getting 51 then in terms of the gearbox is so the six speed manual is there nice Nobel , The Nazi side ? Maybe . And I really think this car warrants automatic gearbox in the auto . In this car , it's a really nice one to use .As for the diesel engine , though , are putting together the two days that I would go and spend a bit extra and get one of the three litre V sixties , or because they are silky smooth on super fast . I'm pretty much just as economical as a two litre diesel .Another thing you got to think about is whether you want the car with front wheel drive or four wheel drive . Now most people would be fine with front wheel drive to tell you the truth , but I think the cultural will drive system just makes it feel a little bit more grippy on dhe . Easier to hustle down a back road . Let's move on to the actual suspension because there's four choices of suspension in this car , ma'am . Oh my God , it's just so confusing . You have comfort or sport normal suspension or comfort on sport adaptive . Now I would go for one of the adaptive because they are better and probably comfort adaptive , because you can still firm that one up by pressing a button in point into sports mode . But when you have in comfort , it's super super waffle . Very , very comfy , though . To be fair , the normal comfort suspension is reasonably enough . On the whole , this car is retty sharp to drive . It's not as much furnace . I have been to be three serious touring , but it's easily good enough on this is a very quiet Carter traveling , and it's easy to drive as well .You got decent visit , but let's say better blind spot here . Maybe the penicillin back as well . If you click up there , you can see yourself joining me for 360 degree passenger right video .Unfortunately , not everything about the idea . A4 event is great . Here's five annoying features .You want full leather interior than intellectual extra on my uncle's .You can get the super efficient alter models Lois Sport suspension , which means a slightly firmer ride .Andi also have the rear windows only going down this far .There's no driver's knee passenger airbag what you get for being to be Free Syria story or a Mercedes C class estate every window .What isn't standard on all models ?Thankfully , there's still plenty , of course things to like about the Audi A4 events .The adaptive cruise control uses the satin updated to figure out that means to break the car slightly tight bends .This is the most aerodynamic estate in its class , which means less one with salt and greater efficiency .If you don't want your dirty doctor in the interior , you could flip this over to wait . Wiped clean side on pennant with this .Next , get while it's charging to your mobile phone . Also longer is your mobile phone support .New Audi A4 advances up to 120 kilos lighter than the old Audi A4 event , which makes it much easier to push . Well , if you got in the system , too , used to being a bobsleigh team gone , Josh , you click it there .You get more information and save an average of �4400 on a new Audi A4 advantage Carli dot co dot uk .So then my overall verdict on this car should do Avoid it should consider it . Should he short list it , or should we just go ahead and buy it well I reckon you should short list the Audi A4 event you're paying extra for Audi badge , but it's a really nice , posh or uncomfortable AM practical car .

160,234,A3,"you remember a few years back when the economy collapsed . Besides the obvious fallout , it also encouraged luxury car buyers to reconsider their needs . Which brings us to here .A3 is Audi is player in the entry luxury segment . The entry part of that statement implies a low price tag .Sure enough , it's possible to buy an A3 sedan for less than $30,000 not including destination charges . It sounds good , but would you actually want to drive the cheapest of A3 Sze ?Actually , yes .Advising on headlights , big sunroof , leather seats and this thin but kind of low resolution 70 screen all comes standard .Granted , a standard back of camera would've been nice to , but as long as you're not backing up the base cars lovely , the basic A3 includes front wheel drive and a 170 horsepower , 1.8 litre four cylinder that can propel it from 0 to 60 in a touch over seven seconds . That number drops to less than six seconds , and the all wheel drive , 220 horsepower to leader trim . Its turbocharged engines exhibit some lad when leaving from a stop , but in general , A3 gains speed well thanks in part to a standard s tronic . Dual clutch transmission , six speed gearbox is a winner , shifting with impressive speed and smoothness .Also deserving of praise is the A3 on road demeanor . Turn the steering wheel in parking and efforts are light and manageable . Do the same at speed , and it switches to firm and engaging . A3 is agile , but it suspension is never abusive . Brakes feel good . The cabin is quiet , and even though it's pretty short in terms of overall length , that's still totally stable on the freeway .Basically , for a small car fan , there's a lot to like here course , that lack of size as implications for the interior . The general layout is clean and logical , with a touch of sportiness , and the material selection is excellent .But the trunk is on the small side and the back seats are , well , cozy .Easy solution is just it up front .Not only do you gain much needed passenger space , but you also get the fiddle with the climate controls , and Audi is nu M ai interface . Both are simple and intuitive , but the anim eyes low placement makes it hard to visually check which button does what It's okay , though with more exposure , it should be easy enough to tell how to use it , just by touch alone , like Audi is larger offerings .The A3 option sheep include some high end gear stuff like a 700 watt , 14 speaker bang and Olufsen audio system led headlights . Audi connect infotainment with Google Earth maps and text to speech functionality and in vehicle lt data connection in a clever touch bad conveniently located atop the M . M . My controller that recognizes handwriting .Add to that a driver assistance package with lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control , and the price for a loaded to leader A3 creeps up to around $45,000 .What else can you get for your money For a little less than the price of a base ? A3 . You could get a Mercedes-Benz C . L . A with fewer features , but an arguably more interesting design . The price here and more powerful BMW to Siri's is another choice . But not if you need four doors . Then there's the accurate dialects and the view of Murano . Both are much cheaper near luxury options , but neither could match the A3 gravitas . We should also mention that over time , the Audi A3 lineup will expand to include a diesel ah , high performance S3 , a cabaret , L . A and an E . Tron plug in hybrid sport back . But it launched . The traditional gasoline powered sedan is the only play just as well . America loves a nice traditional sedan .When people buy a luxury car , they do so because they want an elevated image , premium riding , handling and a bunch of cool features . The Audi A3 It offers all that stuff just in a smaller , more frugal package . If you're a luxury car buyer looking to downsize , or maybe you're just an up and comer looking to dip your toes in the premium car waters , the Audi A3 deserves a closer look ."
161,235,Q7,"I really wanted to phone in this review . I could just say that the latest generation Audi Q7 is an exceptionally nice A7 passenger luxury SUV . But I would like Kelley Blue Book's checks to keep clearing the bank . So here's more detail .Now in its second generation , A7 passenger , Audi Q7 features a completely new , aluminum rich architecture that's hundreds of pounds lighter than the previous Q7 .Get this lighter , prettier , Q7 moving .There's plenty to praise cabinets serenely quiet , which really adds to the aura of luxury , sweet , quiet luxury .Then there's ride quality . The suspension isn't softly sprung . You'll definitely feel the road . But all the unpleasant harshness has been deftly subdued in normal driving . The ride is lovely , but when the moment strikes the Q7 corners with tenacious grip , an impressive body control like what I'm doing right now , all the while steering with delightful directness , you have to drive a car that would carry around a litter of children . Maze will be fun going with the standard Audi Dr Select Controller alters the dampers , steering , throttle and transmission towards sporting or comfort oriented settings . Adaptive chassis package offered on the prestige trim adds a full air suspension and four wheel steering to the mix , heightening the turning circle by three feet and increasing ground clearance by up to 2.4 inches when needed . Q7 road manners occupy a nearly ideal balance point between fun and refinement . It's not surprising , then , that the same character is expressed by the drive train trying now flooring .And now I'm breaking a turbo charged four cylinder and a three liter turbodiesel er in the works . At the moment , all Q7 speech or a supercharged three liter V six who's more than adequate output is managed by a paddle shift double eight speed automatic transmission that knocks out swift , nearly imperceptible shifts . And their power is divided between the front and rear wheels . A standard cuatro all wheel drive system added all up , and you have sub six second 0 to 60 acceleration , good fuel economy and an admirable £7700 toe capability . Fairly unobtrusive automatic engines start stop system is also on board to conserve fuel , but if the driver is so inclined it can be shut off .One particularly nifty detail is the optional Audi virtual cockpit . This high rez 12.3 inch display combines traditional instrumentation with navigation , infotainment and vehicle information , putting it right where you're looking anyway . Also , it looks pretty cool .With all this praise , you might be wondering , is the Q7 the perfect SUV ? It might be perfect for you , but it is not perfect .Here's the flop . Unlike many modern SUVs , flipping down the second row seats requires two steps . Not one step one's not so bad . You pull this lever and just looks forward . Flipping the whole seat forward requires you to push in with the thumb and then pull up on this lever . And then the entire thing rises up . Can the tiny children that are typically banished to the third row operate that thing ? Maybe third row .Access aside , Q7 interiors kind of wonderful . It looks modern and rich and material qualities brilliant , even in spots where some car makers might skim for added effect . Check it out at night . I love the techie , streaky accents and the glowing rings that surround the capacity of touch map lights .Spend 60 grand or more on a new car .You kind of hope it feels like something special . The Audi Q7 does a more functional note .The center console offers very little storage , but there is a handi spot to set your phone with direct access to U . S B outlets . Above those outlets is a handy adjustable arm .Rest further forward , the Q7 controls demand a slight learning curve , but before long they all make sense . Look , the climate controls no when you're touching them , adjusting the display accordingly .Despite being dimensionally smaller than the previous Q7 , The latest generation is actually roomier inside , with sliding and reclining second row seats that split three ways and provide tons of space for passengers and back . The standard power operated 50 50 split third row bench is barely tolerable for adults , but kids shouldn't complain any more than usual related note .There are five child seat latch points , so if you're expecting quintuplets , add the Q7 to your shopping list .Lowering the third row boosts cargo space from 14.8 to a healthy 37.5 cubic feet .In the simplest nearly $56,000 premium trim , the Audi Q7 comes robustly equipped with a power lift gate , leather upholstery , tri zone climate control , six airbags , a two channel Tana Ramic sunroof , front and rear parking sensors and a collision warning system with automatic braking that senses both vehicles and pedestrians .Naturally , you can also outfit You're Q7 with a bevy of fancy pants .Add ons like a foot activated tailgate led headlights , navigation with a retractable 8.3 inch display , replacing the standard seven inch unit . A gesture control pad with handwriting recognition and dorado and apple carplay compatibility , a 23 speaker Bang and Olufsen premium audio system , A4 zone climate control , rear thorax air bags , a rear seat entertainment package and a 360 degree camera system .It's a lot of fun to play with as long as you're blowing out your retirement on a luxury SUV . Why not also add nightvision assist with pedestrian and large animal detection and the Driver Assistance Package , featuring active lane departure mitigation and adaptive cruise control with semi autonomous low speeds , steering throttle and breaking .Play your cards right , and it's possible to spend more than $85,000 on an absolutely loaded Q7 prestige trip pricewise .The entry level Q7 falls approximately in line with the five passenger BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz GLK350 XC90 R8 value priced alternative . Check out the Acura MDX that also seat seven for roughly $10,000 cheaper base price Q7 , though it's a proper luxury vehicle , a legitimate family hauler that's also enjoy to drive and to live with . If somehow your wants and your needs and your budget have aligned and brought you to the magical land of luxury SUVs , the Audi Q7 deserves your attention ."

No , really seen the similarity of the car , However , in this color , I think it looks rather like a stormtrooper .

If you click it there to get a car , why dot co dot uk ? You compare office from dealers and black price . Your confidence is now on the inside .This car is very similar to the A3 on which it's based . Got pretty much the same dust design .

Well , equipment on the whole is okay .A standard getting seven inch touch screen .The interstate system is very good and easy to use .This one has a technology part which costs over �1000 But then you get this 18 screen .It's got a faster processor as well , so you can just worse through the maps and zoom around . It's got all sorts of things , and actually , if you click it there , you can see more information that I watch my detailed entertainment video review and that reason onto the virtual cockpit , which this car hire . So it's a full digital drivers display department upgrade on Deacon cycle through various menus .Change the views on it's Absolutely glorious . Makes this car feel super modern .Denzel quality Well , in your direct line of sight , the matures a soft and yielding , and it doesn't feel very well made . They don't have to go to low until that's not particularly good . Run Audi , really ? But that's really the only let down .On the whole , this is a well built solid car , and the latter border controls is nice and easy . So everything is simple to use terms .A couple spaces there , all right , not quite as good as a mini countryman . That's quite some more spot under there , really door bins . A big enough . I can hold a large bottle , and it's a safe in the back as well as I'll show you now .Actually , the door opening isn't that word on this car ?Oh , yeah .Lock door bins are decent size now in terms of space here in the back . If I sit up straight , I've got just about enough head room near rooms , all right as well . People over six foot will just about be able to cope in the back of this car . But it's not all perfect . You see , I find the back rest a little bit upright . Also the cummings quite dark with this dark reef lining . So it does feel a little bit dingy here in the back . Also the middle seat . Now you don't want to carry three abreast in this car for a couple of reasons . One , this middle seat is quite high . So now my head's touching the roof . The foot walls are small as well , and you end up in the middle seat with your feet on the runners for the seat in front on the body is quite narrow . So you all really squashed in , and you can see for yourself what clicking it there to watch my detail practicality , video because we can fit three people in the back of this car , and we also look at other stuff , such as how easy it is to fit a child , see just how much stuff we could squeeze into this car's boot .And it's a tale of two hearts when it comes to the boots . So the capacity with the seats in place is actually all right on , like the fact that you don't have much of a load lips . It's dead easy to lift items in and out . Here we go . If you don't have the spare wheel , you do have some extra storage under there , and there's various tethering points here . Here . There's No . 12 what socket , which is a little bit annoying . The other thing that's a bit annoying is this look , So I want to fall down the air A6 . I do have to lift up the head rest first . If I want this seats to lie flat of the boys , they work , and then you do have a continuous low flop . Any problem is , is that the outright volume isn't as big on some of its rivals , which might be a bit disappointing if you're the kind of person who wants to use their little SUV as a load longer .That's all the practical stepped out with . Now it's time to hit the road now . I could sum up the driving expensive this car in one word . Good , I presume you want more information . So on the whole , it's very easy to drive race driving position because you could view over traffic . Also , it's fairly comfortable . You can get sport suspension , which has been firm or conferences bedroom , which is spot on Andi conviction for adaptive dampers . And then it's even more comfortable . On the whole , this car starts a good balance between comfort on handling . Yes , it might be slightly talk , but he doesn't roll about too much in the corners . It's got sufficient grip .If you want more grip , he can get it with all wheel drive on the two litre petrol or two litre diesel . I wouldn't really bother . I think it's good enough as is . This is a 1.4 liter turbo petrol , and if you ask me , this is the pick of the range because it goes pretty quickly , especially turn around 51 mpg . I'm getting in getting that much .That's pretty good in terms of cruising ability , while the seats nice and comfortable on dhe . It's quite quite Carter traveling all I've really noticed . There's a bit of wind was so kicked by these a pillars .Speaking of which , that ain't creating much of a blind spot . What does , though , is the massive pillar at the back of the car . That's a really pain , especially putting a junction trying look over your shoulder . Cricket . There you can see for yourself , boy , joining me for a 360 degree passenger right video .Not everything about the attic . You two's great .Here's five anoint Things about it thes Our captors are designed to hold up the fourth floor , see how effective they are .A3 entry level model only gets 16 Eloise . These air 18 and even these are quite small in this car . 16 to retired A8 .We can use this as an example like these 15 but I think the automatic gearboxes great comfort , a little bit jerky when you're trying to do low speed maneuvers .Parking sensors on electric number support our cost option even on the most expensive trim level , unless you pay extra for the freeway , forming split rear seats you don't get enormous in that .Thankfully , the Audi key to has planted core features which help make up for all this .This little guy stops a seat , not snagging .

163,237,Q5,"the Audi Q5 is a compact luxury SUV that does pretty much everything . Well , we could leave it at that . But in honor of Ms Davis , my high school English teacher used to always say , Mr Museo , you're not looking deep enough .Let's dig a little deeper First , the fawning praise interior emerges top quality materials with a crisp modern aesthetic , as if the dude who designs bond villain layers chose to dabble in the automotive realm . Modernism aside , the cockpit is a usable space with unfussy controls .Supportive long haul were the standard powered front seats and a long list of indulgent features .We'll get to you shortly .The backseats are everybody's plush is the front seats like a nice material quality , But I do have some notes . The second row sound slides and declines , but even in the most laid back position , that could use a little more lean . And if you're banished to the middle seat , this incredibly high center tunnel means either adopt this ludicrous position or you put your feet on the floor , where they jam up against the front seat rails . If you'll excuse me , I'm going to move back here .The takeaway save the middle spot for child duty , and the rear quarters worked just fine at the option of panoramic moonroof .And the already delightful cabin feels bright , open and even more delightful before leaving the interior .Though some of our editors dislike the small cup holders , your cup holder aficionado , you have been warned outside , despite a Mr Potato head application of signature Audi design elements when splashed across a Q5 sized canvas , the result is a handsome , sculpted and desirable SUV .Underneath this Q7 like clamshell hatch , we find a nicely shaped 26.8 cubic foot cargo hold , lowering the 40 2040 split rear seats more than doubles . That figure , though , before pulling the conveniently placed releases you might want to remove , the head rests .Powering the Audi Q5 is a turbo charged , two litre four cylinder engine , providing a max operating a 44 £100 fuel economy that , while not amazing for a compact SUV , is actually quite good for a compact luxury SUV inaction . The Turbo four delivers refined power delivery , and when the situation demands spirit of acceleration , handling gear changes , A7 speed , dual clutch transmission and an operation , it delivers the kind of rapid shift you'd expect from a dual clutch , very seamless operation , slightly marred by a little bit of a surgeon . Tendency from the turbocharged engine in the transmission power is channeled to a standard cuatro all wheel drive system that , or improved efficiency directs . Talk to the front wheels during normal driving , however , when needed , an electromechanical , multi plate clutch and rear prop shaft sludge engaged to rapidly send up to 100% of the engine's output , rearward imparting the Q5 with lively handling and all weather grip .Just so you know , the Q5 has a dedicated off road mode and 8.2 inches of ground clearance . If you actually use your fancy SUV to go back through the rugged wilderness , please tweet me a picture inappropriately civilized environment . The Q5 exhibits outstanding driving manners skillfully negotiated the chasm between comfort and sports performance performance .Helping Q5 navigate that chasm is an incredibly quiet cabin , clear outward visibility for the driver and strong breaks offering excellent field .In simplest terms , the Ata Q5 is an absolute pleasure to drive . When you drive like me or my grandmother , she's dead , which gives you give how slow she drives weren't even more comfortable .

I can't just hit podcast . I have to rotate and then select . Audi partially addresses the lack of touch screen functionality with his optional haptic feedback pad .

164,238,TT,"for a car whose original design inspiration came from an overturned bathtub . I assume the Audi TT has done pretty well for itself . And while the third generation model still embodies the same basic shape , the driving experience has evolved considerably .But before we dive into the driving experience , let's touch on the design , which takes on a fresh yet familiar look characterized by a three D style front facia and sharper edges throughout Internet Noah dolls might claim the TT sold its soul to look like a baby R8 . Let's make one thing clear . The TT is a mini R8 in the same way , and FR S is a mini lf A8 that score settled , we'll move inside with the latest TT features .The most useful consolidation efforts not related to credit card debt logic would suggest that when you delete the center screen and cram everything into a single display , the result is an instrument cluster . Fuck Oh , I'm sorry . Against all odds , Audi is virtual cockpit is positively fantastic .The display is easily switched from infotainment focused driver focus with the push of a button located on the steering wheel . Nearly every action produces an almost instantaneous response from the system , while the interplay between navigation , media metadata and pertinent driving information blended together in such a harmonious way that it actually reduced her inclination towards distracted driving . Bolstering that fact is a revamped MM I interface and jester controlled touch pad , whose natural ergonomics allow for ice for use . And while there is a slight learning curve to mastering the system , moderately tech savvy drivers feel right at home following roughly 3 to 4 hours of operation .Adding to the tee tee's minimalist philosophy or digital climate control readouts built directly into the air vents the holy , embracing the elegance of simplicity . Events , fixed positioning and basic twisting adjusters limit the direction of airflow .Apart from an annoying clicking sound at our task unit , Driver's seat left nothing to be desired in terms of comfort or support . On the flip side , the two back seats and Coop models are about as friendly the legs as Annie Wilkes , whereas rear seats in the roadster are non existent .Still , both models make clever use of storage space , not to mention the coops , Andy Liftback design and wagon like 25.1 cubic feet of cargo room that said .We do wish there was a convenient spot to hold your cell phone .Winding mountain roads The TT does virtually everything you ask of it . Everything . No , not everything . With Cuatro Well , driving a light , nimble package like this fits the teaching into a corner . Leave about 20 to 30% throttle on , and grip quickly becomes a non issue , along with almost perfectly centered driving position . The steering response , actually just the physical shape of the steering wheel really elevate the Audi TT above rivals like the BMW , Z4 and Mercedes-Benz SLK . In fact , one of the best qualities of this staring is that the ratio was so tight that you can turn the wheel from lock to lock in two rotations . The turning radius is also tight . Despite the quick steering ratio ride , quality slips between the softer BMW , Z4 and Mercedes-Benz S L C and slightly more aggressive Porsche , Boxter and Cayman . Same goes for stopping power and driver involvement , making the tea , tea and ideal pick for anyone who prefers not to choose between everyday comfort and engaging performance .Where the TT coupe and convertible stand above the rest is in the area of cabin noise , which is equal to that of a small luxury sedan .TT convertible also embodies the qualities of a high end grand tour at a significantly lower price point he attributes , including Elektronik windscreen that actually relieves wind turbulence . Optional events located just below the head .Rest that blow hot air on the back of your neck and a triple layer soft top capable of deploying or retracting about 13 seconds at speeds up to 30 miles an hour .Under the hood lies a two litre turbo charged four cylinder for 220 horsepower and £258 feet of torque made it exclusively to a well mannered six . Be dual clutch automatic . The two litre affords 0 to 60 sprint about five and 1/2 seconds . All while we're turning up to 23 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway . Power taps out just shy of 5000 rpm on paper , but on the road R TT tester pull hard chest off Idol all the way to the 6500 rpm redline and , unlike years passed out , he's next . Gen Turbo four is practically free of turbo lag and tts guys Turbo four has been retuned to produce 292 horsepower into £180 feet of torque without impacting greatly on fuel economy , along with a rear biased over , you'll drive system sharper exterior styling in heavily bolstered sport seats .The TTS carries with it a $9000 primi O over the standard Kuban roadster , beginning 44,000 and $47,000 respectively .Even in base form , the Audi TT comes impressively well equipped with standards like led headlights , green sensing windshield wipers , capitalist fuel filler , Audi Dr Select with an individual mode as eventually , push button start heated leather seats in the after mansion .MM , my virtual cockpit linked to a nine speaker audio system .Throw an extra $4000 onto the pile and you'll drive away with navigation and bet it lt . Hot spot .Blind spot monitoring in a highly recommendable 12 speaker sound system by banging Oleson .Given that a fully loaded TT undercuts comparably equipped models from BMW , Porsche and Mercedes-Benz as much as $3500 Audi TT could be considered a relative bargain . It may not be all things to all people , but if you're among the subset of subset of buyers were in the market for a two door luxury sports Cooper convertible . The Audi T T tough to be ."
165,239,RS5,"in life . There's a hierarchy . Big things , the little things . Powerful stuff rises to the top . I swat black flies out of my face . That same dynamic holds true without he's at the A5 coop . It's more powerful S5 sibling and now at the top in the Alfa position with the RS5 .So what exactly qualifies the RS5 for the Alfa position ? Others , the 4.2 liter , naturally aspirated V8 , with its 450 horsepower output routed through a seven speed dual clutch transmission and sent to the ground via Quattro , will Drive system , featuring a limited slip torque vectoring rear differential . RS5 has abundant performance . Potential thief V8 torque rating of £317 feet may seem a little underwhelming , but the engine makes up for that number with over abundant reds . A couple of the side benefits of 8500 rpm redline include the car basically taunting you to drive it hard and a wicked banshee wail when you really get on it long with thrilling top end rush , the RS5 expels inspirational engine Theo vehicles launch control system and you'll be treated to a glorious V8 ground as well . A 0 to 60 acceleration in about 4.5 seconds . And now , just in case you care , the Audi RS5 e p a estimated fuel economy figures and enough that putting big power in the hands of marginally talented journalists on a race track isn't always a good idea . But like Neil DeGrasse Tyson explaining astrophysics , the RS5 coop makes stellar performance remarkably accessible .He did that accessibility is the Quattro all wheel drive system , which dynamically deviates from a standard 40 60 front rear split as traction demands , sending as much as 85% of the engine power to the rear wheels . Adding to the RS5 all wheel drive excellence is a torque vectoring differential that improved agility by over driving the outside rear wheel driver's seat . That constant redirection of torque manifests itself as utterly predictable , drama free acceleration out of the corners and add to that abundant lateral grip and slightly numb but precise steering . And you have a compelling , dynamic package that welcomes drivers rather than intimidating them , which is a nice trade on unfamiliar back roads , where the high speed Benz and blind crest that defined Sears point further reassuring the driver are powerful front brakes consisting of 14.4 inch disks squeezed by A8 piston Brembo calipers .Note the disks . Neat looking , weight reducing wave design feature previously only seen on motorcycles and for buyers who think excellent isn't quite good enough . Carbon ceramic front brakes are also available .Is an option like of a manual transmission in the RS5 might be off putting to some , but there's no denying the excellence of the seven speed dual clutch . It shifts quickly . It offers better throttle response than a traditional automatic and freeze your left clutch leg upto . Operate the brakes .Really , if you want to lament missing component tree . Focus on the lack of an old school E brake as the electron IC e break with its little activation Lever really isn't made for dusty back roads shenanigans .On the other hand , the absence of a brake handle allows for a super clean interior design building on the basic A5 S5 cabin , the RS5 features carbon fibre trim , a flat bottom steering wheel , heavily bolstered sport seats and redesigned door handles that create an impression of lightness , if not actual lightness .Exterior . The RS5 shares only a hood roof and doors with its A5 S5 siblings . Elsewhere , fenders have been flared air and let's enlarged , a retractable spoiler added , and the right height lowered by 0.8 inches versus the A5 , along with striking led running lights and a huge honey comb grill . It's numerous exterior enhancements give the RS a visual presence that supersedes the already gorgeous A5 and S5 .Despite its track ready appearance , most RS5 will spend their lives on the streets for domestic duty . Right is firm but not harsh . Without fancy magnetic dampers , A single suspension setting has to work in all environments . Thankfully , it's a reasonable compromise that works well both here and here .For a hair under $70,000 you can claim an Audi RS5 of your very own . But before you do , we should mention that the Mercedes-Benz C 63 BMW M3 each cost about $10,000 less .And both are highly capable performers in their own right . Car fans can certainly debate it's cost performance ratio for the elite .Actually , considering RS5 $10,000 premium , it commands may not be a huge deal .After all , the heart wants what the heart wants . Qualities like excellent design , exhilarating yet unintimidating performance in an iconoclastic spirit . Top the hierarchy of your heart , the Audi RS5 . It's probably worth the money"

167,241,A4,"there is nothing wrong with an iterative approach to automotive development . If a model sells well and the foundation is strong , why tear it all down and start over again ? The latest generation Audi A4 proves that a car could redefine the segment without reinventing it .Ah , first glance , it seems out his design team simply phoned in the exterior aesthetic nobody panel carries over from the previous generation .Fixed to this homed in tone sheet metal is a lighter , more rigid chassis that allows for some brilliant suspension Tuning . Conventional wisdom would suggest that a true luxury sedan must sacrifice a measure of handling performance in the name of comfort . Not sure exactly how Audi pulled it off , but the A4 cuatro simultaneously groups like a vice and rides like a proper luxury cruiser . And then there's the steering has a certifiable steering snob . I have to say the A4 is after my own heart . The waiting is spot on at every speed , especially on the highway , where it's so well calibrated . It fuels , is it The car becomes Maur stable , the further you straight from the speed limit that we don't condone such an action .That fantastic steering combined with an extremely tight turning radius makes the A4 a joy to navigate through tight spaces .Adding to that joy are excellent economics , good sightlines at a cabin that's quieter than that of the Lexus I s and BMW three Siri's .And while every model in this category offers a two litre turbo for the A4 , Sze is something special . Aside from frustratingly Laghi throttle response , which can be alleviated by switching to the dynamic drive boat setting , this engine produces 252 horsepower in two and £73 feet of torque , good for a 0 to 60 spread of around five and 1/2 seconds . And that's pretty quick . And , unlike yours , passed this to leader , pulls hard all the way through the rpm range and sound pretty darn good doing it .Best of all , Audi totally sandbagged it C p . A fuel economy ratings because we lost 38.4 mpg on the highway at an average speed of 71 miles an hour during our road test .If efficiency trumps all that , perhaps there's a Prius in your future .Or you can offer a based A4 ultra in its de tune two Litre Turbo four . Both engines route power to the front or all four wheels for a smooth yet remarkably quick seven speed , dual clutch automatic transmission .Inside , A4 driver oriented cockpit reach passengers with a dignified show of luxury . Apart from rock hard knee rest , the rest of the interior is laden with high quality soft touch materials in thoughtful touches like a highly adjustable center arm . Rest long through a steering wheel in nifty capacitive rocker switches . For the climate control system .Outback , however , leg room is average at best in the middle , seat is effectively uninhabitable .And again , these tight rear quarters afford the A4 , one of the largest trunks and the segment needed further by a wide aperture passed through in rear seatbacks that pulled almost completely flat .Practical accommodations aside , the interior center of attention resides within the dash . Audi did their homework on human machine interfaces , and it shows with the virtual cockpit . What could have been a distracting mass is in fact a well sorted , easy to use digital interface that integrate seamlessly with the primary .And in my system , though it lacks the wow factor of the virtual cockpit out his next generation Mm I system is an absolute joy to use a large rotary dial , cleverly situated , surrounded controls and uncluttered interface gett notably easier to operate than most competitors . Systems topping it all . Office standard Apple Carplay and Android Auto integration along with the BMW three .Siri's , an Infiniti Q 50 Audi A4 opens at just under $36,000 including destination fees that would includes a lengthier list of standard equipment , the likes of which consistent , seen on headlights with led running lamps , automatic headlight control , rain sensing windshield wipers , leather .Eight way power driver's seat with four way lumbar support .Moon roof and be an interior lighting Elektronik parking brake . A 10 speaker audio system tied to a seven inch display .Back up camera in lieu speed automatic emergency braking .Moving up . The packaging food chain lands you with 360 degree camera system .A 19 speaker premium on your system by banging Olsen front seat by extension , with four way head rest , whole range , adaptive cruise control feed , signed detection and lane keeping assist .And while the A4 $54,500 loaded price might sound a bit steep , it's actually not seeing as a similarly equipped jag U ar X6 or Mercedes-Benz C300 cost thousands more . On the other hand , the A4 is residual values continue to trail those of its Lexus , BMW and Mercedes rivals , but in large part to Audi is less than stellar history of long term reliability but a welcome byproduct of incremental engineering .His improved reliability . And that means the A4 chief criticism could soon be laid to rest . And when it does , the segment could also be looking at its newest benchmark ."
168,242,R8,"people often ask Myka , what's your favorite car ? I used to say , Well , how many people who have to carry How much money do I have ? What am I doing with it ? That wishy washy answer is gone . I have a favorite car Now it's the Audi R8 5.2 F s I cuatro .Here's why it's fast and not just normal . Car . Fast supercar Fast S60 comes in a little less than four seconds . Top speed . A little less than 200 miles an hour .5.2 liter V 10 produces 5 25 horsepower . One of the most amazing engine note I've ever heard .Take all that intense A4 velocity . Couple it with amazing V 10 roar and it's just pure visible speed .V8 10 redlines at Honda taunting 8700 rpm . So you could , if you wanted to launch it in third gear and have a wide enough rpm band to just treat it like a one speed car kind like a fixed gear bike for the automotive set Hipster Not included , but then you've missed out on using this excellent gated shifter .Theo . Six speed manual is pure mechanical bliss . Listen as the aluminum shifter passes the metal gates .Every gear shift feels like a big deal . Like your reloading a 30 aught six shift fire .The R E D 10 is fast , capable and fun . It's also approachable . Let me say , approachable , Lish . If you leave the stability control on , it's lots of fun . You could much around all day take it off . There's a slight bit of understeer , and then it will oversteer on you . Be sure to catch that thing . That's nice about the Audi R8 is that it's all we'll drive vehicle . The Quattro system sends just a little bit of power to the front wheel , so it still feels like a rear drive car . But that front power told you right through the corners . And if you're on a really slippery track or driving from snow for some stupid reason , it'll help you there , too .On track performance is outstanding , but bring the R8 out into the real world , and an adaptive magnetic ride suspension means you can switch the dampers from track stiff to freeway , smooth with the push of a button . In fact , I'd say the ride is smooth enough that I would happily drive this R8 all the way across America .You can think of a quicker , more stylish with a blast across Kansas .I'd like to hear it way front trunk , while not gargantuan , is big enough to accommodate a couple of bags , even a tripod . If by chance you're filming R8 video getting into the interior .Also , not very supercar like you just open the door and you get in . There's no crawling or gymnastics . Once you're in ample headroom . Ample leg room . I could move the seat back several inches and then the steering wheel in telescopes like a really long distance . So it just goes right where your hands want it . It's awesome . Last thing that I really like .The fact that there's a dead battle over there so in my left leg isn't operating the clutch . It's got somewhere to laze about .Audi R8 is an exotic car without the factor people see , and they think Tony Stark . No cool , fun , stylish cross .I'm not pretentious from its led lighting front rear .It's conspicuous side blades . The Audi R8 looks like it was designed in the future and sent back to our generation , perhaps driven by it naked . Arnold Schwarzenegger so I'm gushing . Surely the R8 has some flaws , right ? Drew , enough . If you look right here , this plastic hard could be soft .Also , 15 miles per gallon Combined fuel economy isn't gonna make me any more popular with Mother Nature .See , all that's nitpicking . A real problem with the Audi R8 5.2 is the $150,000 base price .And that's why the Audi R8 5.2 is my favorite car .Gives me everything I want in a car power handling style and all it asks in return .Is that idea as exceptional as Indians ? So now , finding fabulous wealth and success in order to afford it seems fair ."
169,243,R8,"that way before . But Audi R8 is my favorite car . Quickly recapping live , it's fast , it's sexy . It's rooming for two plus luggage . It's playful but manageable on the race track , and yet it's amazingly civilized . In the real world , though , that gushing praise there were flaws . Nothing Audi has seen fit to rejuvenate the R8 To start , let's lay out what hasn't changed . The Audi R8 is still a two seed supercar offered in coop and drop top . Spider body styles were biased .All wheel drive continues as the power delivery scheme of choice , and the engine selection still includes a perfectly satisfying 4.2 liter V8 and a wicked sounding Lamborghini sourced 5.2 liter V 10 .There are changes .Astute R8 fans might notice subtle exterior changes like redesigned side mirrors , round tailpipes , a reworked grill , new wheels and the addition of wave breaks to the V8 and V 10 models . Adding to the exteriors visual impact are now standard led headlights because what's a top tier Audi without an explosion of L . E . D's ? Speaking of ladies , incredibly cool tail lights featuring 30 led is that illuminate directionally outward when signalling are also standard If you live in Europe , do the brilliant Department of Transportation regulations American R8 get . He's much less cool , much less safe , clearly inferior units . Thanks D o T .Themes for the interior . There are several similarly minor updates , including revised trim , a thicker steering wheel and optional diamonds . Dejan Apple . Other seats .Remember when I said the Audi R8 had flaws ? One big one was . It's our tronic automatic transmission . Thankfully , the slow operation and clunky shifts of the art tronic have been replaced by a much , much better A7 speed . Dual clutch New S Tronic Dual clutch transmission works wonderfully well provides super quick fast ships . Very smooth has the convenience of to peddle operation just like a regular automatic transmission . And it's way more efficient . Fuel economy wise in the manual . Despite the S6 functional superiority , I'd still choose the manual transmission and given a choice , not only doesn't have that satisfying link between every shift , but it's also $9000 cheaper than dual clutch .New to the lineup is this range topping 550 horsepower R8 V8 10 plus , which boasts a 25 horsepower advantage over the standard V 10 who big deal you say ? Fair enough .But at least that 25 horsepower advantage comes in a car that weighs £130 less , thanks to carbon ceramic brakes , manual seats , reduced sound insulation in the engine compartment , a smaller fuel tank and a bunch of carbon fibre thrown around the car well attached to the car , you know .Also worth knowing the V 10 plus on Lee comes as a coupe is a mere 100.1 seconds faster to 60 in the non plus 10 is the only R8 that can be had with the sweet Matt Blue paint job and starts around 100 $75,000 including destination and A3 $1000 gas guzzler tax .If that seems pricey , remember , basic V8 could be had for a mere $119,000 or so . That price went up by two .Honestly , the revitalized R8 . It's not that different from the one that preceded it , which is fine because it was a brilliant package . To start with . Improvements they've made , especially the dual clutch transmission , have simply minimized the R8 devices while maximizing its virtues . Way have is a supercar that's formidable and fun . It's still a joy to drive , and all you're doing is connecting Point A to point B . You know , Lamborghinis and Ferraris , maybe built to inspire passion . But there are a boat to drive all the improvements . Just make that drive a little more magic . Who ? Magic Theo ."
170,244,Q3,"luxury automakers air fully embracing the latest trend of downsizing without downgrading . Among the newest members of this growing breed of upmarket runabouts is the Audi Q3 , looking more like a caricature of a Q5 than in A3 crossover .The Q3 is distinctive . Silhouette is both instantly recognizable , inappropriately minimalistic .For instance . I don't have to slide my seat forward for an average sized adult to sit comfortably behind me , and there's chess enough room up front to sufficiently ignore the person sitting next to you . Come on , buddy . Read about jet packs .Who to that end Q3 equals the slightly longer BMW X1 when it comes to maximum cargo space while besting the similarly sized Mercedes-Benz G l A n e early five cubic feet .This versatile yet elegant interior is assembled with first rate materials and impeccable fit and finish . In fact , even the plastic lower dash resembles a soft touch surface support .Heat dissipation from the Stainer 12 way driver's seat ranks near the top of the class will tense padding under lays the inboard and outboard armrest and both rows of seats . But an exquisitely crafted cabin doesn't tell the whole story , but we do have a few bones to pick with the execution .Besides sun visors that don't extend our chief complaint with the interiors , the restricted downward travel of the steering wheel , the raising the seat of the obvious solution for the vertically challenged , taller drivers are forced to make do with this awkward driving position .Working ergonomics aside , the Q3 impresses on several counts . When the wheels began to turn supremely well balanced in every respect , the Q3 threads through corners with the agility of its four door sibling .We couldn't ask for a more precisely calibrated steering system this side of dedicated sports cars . Add to that a quieter cabin that BMW X1 and a smoother ride than the Mercedes-Benz G L A . And it wouldn't be a stretch to say . The Audi Q3 runs the table on the ride and handling department under hood . Motivation is provided by Audi Time tested , two litre turbo charged four cylinder engine and six speed automatic gearbox . The standard front drive platform could be upgraded to cuatro all wheel drive for an extra $2100 .Q3 won't set the world alight when it comes to flat out acceleration , but never has there been a situation where we found ourselves yearning for more power .That again Q3 cuatro nets rather middling fuel economy , scores of 20 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway . And despite our best efforts , Rhea World fuel economy figures virtually mirrored those of the e p . A A4 perspective . The more powerful X1 X Drive 28 . I returned 34 mpg on the highway during a previous road test . But unlike Q3 , that's where the X1 value story ends .So in keeping with a compliment sandwich theme , the Q3 once again earns high praise for a well thought out center stack and steering wheel controls .The latest rendition of Audi Mm I represents a dramatic departure from years past . I no longer find myself shouting at the voice recognition assistant like an overzealous T ball coach in the control interface is logically laid out so as to minimize driver distraction . To top it all off out . His navigation maps feature some of the most beautiful graphics in the industry .Regarding dollars and cents , the Audi Q3 is mid $34,000 . Starting price includes a slew of premium standards such as HIV , headlights , leather upholstery .Heated front seats , aluminum roof rails , a panoramic moon roof held the sun .Assist , a 10 speaker audio system with Bluetooth connectivity . Duels on climate control . Hell , it's access and start rain sensing wipers and an utterly useless SD card slot . Those looking for a blind spot monitor and a backup camera .We'll need a dish out an extra $1400 for the driver assistance package .Stepping up to the $37,000 prestige trim brings with it a power liftgate navigation , 14 speaker Bose audio system and a full color driver information display .Looking at the competitive landscape . Alexis and exes Strong residuals in class Exclusive amenities like ventilated front seats and adaptive cruise control bring about a terrific value , whereas the BMW X1 doesn't know the meaning of the word to demonstrate a base X1 and it's alluring . Sub $32,000 Starting price can't hold a candle to the Q3 standard equipment roster . BMW actually cost around $3500 more than a comparably equipped Audi No entry level luxury SUV could be all things to all people . But if your tastes run more towards the middle of the value , comfort and dynamism scale , the Audi Q3 could be the one you've been waiting for ."
171,245,Q3,"This is the Audi Q3 now .For me , it's a little bit like a tor toys by . The reason for that is that the shape of it reminds me of Tor toys with its shell . No . Well , how about for do that ? Yeah , got it .Another reason is that it seems have been around for ages .It's getting on a bit now , this car . But that doesn't stop Audi from still charging from just over �26,000 for one . However , if you click up there to get a car , wow dot co dot uk , you can compare office from dealers and by price , you're confident in non average people . Save �3600 . Our new car A3 call .Why Q3 It is getting a bit , but I was trying to spruce it up with a new grill and some flash new tail lights on . When you jump on the inside the interior of this car , I mean , it's all very nice . It's well made . It's typical . Audi quality is just that . It's one of the older generation of Audi cars . Rather one of the more modern ones that they knew Q5 , for instance , of the new A4 and as a result of the design , is starting to feel a little bit on the old side . So the layout of the controls down here , the dash design , you conquered it with a virtual cockpit .The way this pops up and you control it with this little wheel here , the entertainment system rather than the new mm I system down here on in . It's all right to use this entertainment system . It's just not as good . Like I say is the very latest Audi system on . If you look up there , you can see how full in depth review of the entertainment system for more information .But other than that , you know , it's still a very nice Carter sited on .It's practical as well . A bit storage injury you've got . Yeah , nickel of boxes and right side . But the door been their massive that can hold bigger balls than this on this thing continues here in the back of the car . So just calling for us to show you so yeah , look , if it's no problem at all , on the whole I fit , no problem .It'll put in the room on Henry , and people have six foot gonna find in the back of this Q3 . Carrying three is not so good , though , because this central seat is quite small and it's raised up to you to get a little less headroom . But it is doable if you need to know what's not .Double is resting on there because , yeah , there's no arrest , no ski hatch , either . Which is a bit of a shame that brings onto the boot .So the boot of the Q3 is smaller than that on the Mercedes Gel A . And it's more than that other BMW X1 . It's bigger than that , then on an A3 , though , so it might be enough for most people . Nice square shape . As you can see , it's got the usual kind of features . Expecting these kind of cars , they got some tethering points there . Why can't see for love , nor money is 12 volt socket . So if you want to hoover at the boot or plug into electrical devices , you can't even under there . But look , we do have a space saver , spare will and a little bit extra stories around the edges . If I fold the seats down , you'll see how the land does lie and you'll say that it doesn't like completely flat that the floor is continuous , which does help when sliding things . That , though this bit of Google , it does cause a bit of an obstruction . But it's not too large , and you got nice scuff play over it , so you don't scratch the paintwork . Actually , I'll tell you one thing about this car because the boots quite wide , it does provide a shelter when it's raining . If you want to know how much that if you actually come into this car boot click up there , watch our detail practicality , video .You'll see how easy it is to fit a child in the back of this car on just what it's really like with three adults in the back .But you can't wait . Now , though , it's time to find out what the Q3 is like to drive . So let's hit the road . So this Q3 DS . It's actually a fairly pleasant car to drive , so it does something that allowed is due where it goes about its business without too much fuss . It does everything rather well , but doesn't particular set the world alight , so the handling it sure footed it's grippy , especially this one got cultural will drive . Yeah , it goes with your pointing . You just don't feel too much of what's going on . But you don't really care , because the flip side of that is that you don't feel too much of what's going on when you're driving around town . It's all nice and easy . That's what most bars will like . Comfort wise . No bad . So it goes of bones well enough , though Eslite models have loads different suspension on they get . Big World does impact on the ride , but you can ask your data to fit the car with comfort suspension on our recommend . You do that . You can also fit adaptive dampers if you want to .In terms of sound , insulation is generally pretty good . There is better tire roar , and I think visibility is quite nice in this car .See , sit up tall to get a decent view out . Dr . Many blind spots decent view out the back window , and if you want to save yourself , click up there to join me for 360 great passenger right video .They get the Q3 where two petrol or two diesel engines , and if I were you , I will go for the 1.4 liter turbo petrol with 150 horsepower . It's nippy , It's smooth , gives decent economy on you could get it has front wheel drive only , which will save you some money . And it's about it you don't really need or will drive . This car Q3 is also available in the six speed manual , which is Lord or this seven speed automatic , which is also very good . This particular car has a two litre diesel engine in it , with cultural will drive on the Estrada gearbox , and it should be able to do about 53 miles per gallon . But I'm averaging 40 . Still , it's fairly quick . It's got 180 horsepower . A girl like this .There's plenty to like about the idea . Q3 , however , it does have a few annoying features is five .The K through doesn't have any normal USB imports . You have tohave an Audi specific dong . What ? It's a bit like an apple MacBook in that respect , and this one is for an apple iPhone . So , yeah , I'm screwed today . Then the car started .Three year warranty only covers you up to 60,000 miles . Where is that for BMW ? X1 Mercedes-Benz will cover you up to 100,000 miles . So after that you might have to work on it yourself . A bit confusing .This fake plastic honeycomb grill just looks a bit tacky , though the producer does quite like it , however , he's no arbiter of star . Look at your shoes .This press car came with a little feedback for Well , I wasn't feedback for you . Audi No . One listens to CDs anymore .Unlike within your A3 , you can't get the Q3 with auto emergency brake ings . Start , stop , stop , stop .Thankfully , there's still plenty to like about the Audi Q3 to help make up for all this .Here's five call features , yet electric powered members for as standard right across the range . Whereas you don't get a standard on the new A4 .This surfaces grippy to stop your keys rattling around the place on .You've even got a little hook . Be shopping .This car's really indicators .

172,246,E Tron,"Hello and welcome to the top of Pikes Peak in Colorado , USA . It's about 4:30 a.m. In the morning . I'm freezing cold completely underdressed because I didn't realize it be this cold at around 4500 meters above sea level . Anyway , I'm here with the new Audi trying on . The idea is that normal people , they drive up , they raise up Pikes Peak here , we're going to the opposite . We're gonna roll down it . Reason being this is out his first ever electric vehicle . And we want to see just how good his energy regeneration system is .So gonna roll down and try and recoup energy through breaking Put it back in the batteries . And hopefully , as we go down through about 2500 meters over a distance of about 30 commenters , we will be able to regain about 10 kilowatts of charge . But we'll wait . Let's find out .Case I'm in the back of each one on with the top of Pikes Peak ready to go on my lap . Is this iPad ? It's basically the show Exactly what's going on . I've got a driver Victor there , who's going to controlling the car and it's going to be rolling down the hill on what's happening with the car will be shown here . So it'll show how were recovering the energy right ? And Victor , Let's do it . So now we're rolling down the hill trying .Explain how this system works so you can have the court in a recuperation mode . And what that does is you're just basically rolling , but it's slowing your slightly because you've got the regenerative braking working . But you're not actually doing anything , and you activate that by pulling a paddle on the steering wheel . If you want that region breaking to be more severe , you pull that paddle again , and I'll give you even greater recuperation . Now what you can do if you get a little bit too quickly because this is steep down there , you might need to use the brakes , and then you apply the brake pedal on up to a certain level of breaking . It will just still be using the recuperation . The bracing won't use the hydraulic breaking , but the point that you need that extra stopping power . It will then blend in the normal brakes , and the way the system works is that it's all brake by wire . There's no step will change in the pedal . Feel it'll . It just does it all naturally and works out for you . The idea being that it gives you maximum recuperation regardless of how you drive on dit will always give you a nice break pedal feel , which is what you want .So we're just about to reach the halfway point . We have re coop four point due kilowatts . A7 have been through coasting on 1.4 has been through breaking this woman doesn't seem to give a talk sometime . Record something again .Can you tell me what's going on here ? Yes . So I'm checking the brake temperature to make sure that it is under 300 degrees Fahrenheit . Um , otherwise the brakes are too hot and you have to stop and let them cool off . His temperature was 58 degrees Fahrenheit . Very , very , very good . Yes , you do this normally every day Pikes peak people coming down , you have to make sure that breaks onto hot . Otherwise , they may crash . Yet their brakes can fail . They'll just run off the side of the mountains Way . How often do you find someone with brake temperatures over 300 degrees . How many times a day ? Um , somewhere around 50 or so . Really ? Yeah . On how often do you see people with brake temperatures of 50 degrees ? Like not in a normal gas powered car ? You won't see them . I've seen 64 65 . That's usually is low . Is it yet ? Okay , I'm gonna point this out . Now , This is nothing to do with Victor's skill . It's all down to the car , right ? Sorry . Victor . Yeah . Somebody comes down with 64 degree breaks . We know that they've been driving correctly , Okay , but because we've done this well , we get surprised . I want smarties because you're so smart and can drive your car well , not to prove just how little is used .The brakes . Victor here is conditioning . That would only be very , very stupid and brave . But it's not so much in this case . Victor is going to touch the brake disc Now . Either Victor is made of asbestos us or he hasn't really use the brakes much . It's cold . Let me try . Let me try . Yeah , yeah , it's absolutely fine on that . Just goes to show that really it's not using the breaker .Torme's using the recuperation system . But Victor has it felt just like driving a normal car with normal breaks . It felt like a normal car because I used the normal brake pedal and we didn't use the hydraulic brake used the recuperation and so no heat came up to the brake on .Hate is basically lost energy , isn't it ? Exactly . And we put all the energy back into the battery Bravo job . Right .So I've been upgraded to the business class seat . So I'm going to see what it's like here in the front to give you a bit of a review of actually in terms of the comfort level .Seems quite nice .Have you got a suspension ? It seems like we got air suspension . Four corner suspension . Yes , it's very comfy .What's the way of this car ? But the rate is between two and three tons .Okay , Yeah , because it's got that feeling that you get from electric cars when they have to have slightly stiffer suspension because the heavier about the center of gravity is lower . We have your big compromise would compromise between the vehicle dynamics and the bacon comfort and with this car , because off the low gravity sent off gravity . You don't feel that great . Okay , so he's gonna pee . Or maybe I'm I've been all of it . You can feel it a little bit . Victor , you can . Don't you try to trick May .It's nice . I really like the inside of it , though . The design is lovely , that there's one thing I've got to show you .I absolutely adore this . This has cameras for dormers . Actual review is projected just on the door panel . That is a really cool feature . It's a nice touch by Audi .One of the interesting things about this car is the sailing mode . So in a lot of electric cars , when he back off the accelerator , you automatically gets , um , regenerative effect , which slows you down . Where's with this one ? You don't it almost coast just like a normal automatic . And then you can decide whether you want to provide some kind of breaking on DSM regeneration by the using the breakers , feathering it or using those paddles on the steering wheel so it allows you to maximize their efficiency because you might just see that there's long , straight ahead .You want to back off a throw , but you don't really want to slow down on this car lies to do that . Where's other electric cars you can't write ?We're coming to the end of our 30 kilometers . And I'm looking down at the iPad to see just how much energy we have regained .The top I predicted be around 10 kilowatt hours . We're just gonna pull in here and check . Has Victor done a good job ? So he's stopping now . Oh , keeper gauges for a second . You need to go to the O . There you are . Come on . Will it take over to There we go . You've done it . He actually held it . So just 10 kilowatt hours . As you can see , we managed to do it .

Big , bulky , fit in the door equipments impressive to our standard .You get any day headlamps on .On the whole , this is a very well equipped car , though it does have �10,000 worth of opposite on this one , which , actually , by any standards , isn't really all that much on .It's a similar story of the beat , you see . Okay , so it's it's large , but by limousine standards , it's a little bit on the small side now . The main problem is that it doesn't go back that far . I mean , yes , it is a nice square . Shaped have got quite big . Opening the boot on a bear to be seven series is larger . You do have a bit of under floor storage here , but well , with space saver spare Well There's not much room for anything else , however , the back seats .What this car's all about now this is a long wheelbase version , and needless to say , you go absolutely loads of knee room . Though the normal car is actually fine as well , they're pretty not quite . Spaces in the back has been to be seven Siri's , but we're splitting hairs . So this particular model , as you can see all yes , lovely , easier stretch out on . We've got the upgraded seats at the press of one button . I can reclined them .

Now . This car might be a lot older than its rivals and due for replacement soon , but it doesn't seem to age dynamically . It really is an impressive package . So standard you get air suspension on it is a little bit firmer than saying the Mercedes s class , but it's still Riserva , Bubs . Extremely well on . If you want to , you can put it into dynamic mon . It stiffens things up on . Actually , this car handles surprisingly well for such a big limousine . Things have to be careful that you don't go around corners too quickly . You might make your V i p spill their champagne . On the whole , this is really relaxing car to travel .And so it's very quiet . This one's got double glazing , so there's no wind at all . You do get a little bit Tyrell , though , but really in terms of engines .Well , a couple of patrols on two diesels . This is the cheapest engineers the V six days off , but it's still easily , fast enough , nor to 60 in just under six seconds . So Andy says this car should be capable of 47 miles per gallon . I look down the chicken , Peter , I'm doing 36 which isn't bad , really , for such a big car gearbox .Yeah , it's fine . Put your foot down response when he wanted to , and it's nice and smooth .The only problem is , is really good visibility . It's a little bit lacking , and if you look up there , you can see for yourself by watching my 360 great passenger on video .On the whole , though , the Audi A8 is stunning the test of time pretty well . But there are a few things which can get no normal USB sockets anywhere in the car .Just this weird Audi connector . But this one's for an iPhone . Roads are con charge , my android .In the UK , you can only get the A8 with petrol or diesel power .Unlike with rivals , there's no hybrid version this touch , but for the entertainment system is really difficult to use in right hand drive cars unless your left 500E from a distance .It's very easy for people to confuse his car with a far cheaper A6 , and you have to go up and go , Oh yes , look , it is the A8 .This non controls the temperature . But to control the fun , you have to press this button first and then used to say no . But that's just a bit of a still .These are really only minor issues .There are plenty of cool things to like about the A8 with a wheelbase versions , you can get optional foot long list for the passengers .Fortune's car doesn't have those , So if you get the optional matrix led headlands , they'll use information from the satin after automatically swivel fur Abend even before you turn the steering wheel .The entertainment system may be getting on a bit , but you can get it with Google Earth .On street view , V8 petrels will shut down half of their cylinders . When you're cruising to help save fuel , there never is economical . A CZ one day's ALS .If you get the optional night vision , it can spot traditions in the road , and it'll flash the car's lights three times as a warning .So then overall , what I think of the Audi A8 well , rivals do have bigger , more useful boots on the entertainment system .It feels dated .But this is a very complicated traveling , and it also handles very well for a big vehicle .Never click it .

174,248,E Tron,"like a more low them SUV's that the biggest segment of car in the world , Mercedes are about to launch the e que si jag launched the I paced fully electric SUV and now Audi . I've got the trunk . This is their first fully electric offering , and I'm gonna be driving it for the next two solid days across the United Arab Emirates . So hot , dusty , unforgiving conditions . This is a 95 kilowatt hour SUV , 248.5 miles on the W L T P . Skeletal S8 turned from 50 miles more than 400 kilometres , and it's the first car in the world to go into production with them non mirrors cameras instead of mirrors . Not totally convinced , Let's go for a drive .The each on is no lightweight . In fact , it's the heaviest beast in its class . It's heavier than a Model X buy . Like 100 30 odd kilos . It's heavier than a jag . I paced by over 350 kilos , and all that mass has to be stopped . Now I already say sometimes being heavy plays in the favor of being an evil . I'm not too sure about that , but That's why they've concentrated on saying they've got really efficient harvesting of energy on region . Now , what's weird is minus makes the region more aggressive , which I don't entirely understand . And it's actually really , really efficient . Going down the hill , I managed to glean so many more kilometers back . It was brilliant . So yes , it's a heavy big mass to move along . But I guess you could grab loads of miles back through that kinetic energy . So that's a good thing .Okay , so the main floor pan is obviously batteries on . You've got to tears here . This is the second level . We decided to install this . What we called second floor in order to give the customer more range . So you've got 432 cells . 36 modules . Yes , 36 .These modules , 12 cells in each module made by LG lt in Poland . Exactly . Right . Okay . Opponents of modules off the battery system you do ourselves at our CEO to neutral plant in Brussels . Okay , so this car is made in Brussels . Cars made in Brussels and the battery assembly is also done in Brussels . Okay , So less less world travel for the components . Exactly . Okay . Doesn't really make the motors for this car . We do very important parts off the motors ourselves in our factory , in your in Hungary . Okay ? Yes . And we also installed some years ago a technical center there to drive innovation A4 electric engines . Are you gonna put all of this drive train in liken A6 event and A4 as a group ? We haven't . You could call it to learning . Protects . Created what we call the p p . The premium platform electric on this will be the basis for all the new electric cars that you will see in the future . Bigger cars ? Yes . And the smaller cars will be based on what we call the anybody on the modular electric platform done by force Market brand The idee Siri's e Exactly . Yeah . And you will also see Audi is based on this charge time ?No . One of the interesting things about the each one is the fact that you can charge it on either side . You've got these slide down lovely little ports on that certain on this . But you've got tight too . On the other side , not ccs . This has ccs on well left hand drive on the driver's side on the right and drive . It'll be the passenger side , and it can charge is the first production electric car . Audi says that can charge 150 kill awards , in other words , nor to 80% charge in less than half an hour .Okay , we've now momentarily decamped out of my red each on and we're going to go into a sort of weird zebra camo , one to dio a bit of off roading . Honor on the nature . Is it of here ? Uh , what ? One of the best aspects of off road where you need instant talk . You need to be able thio grip pretty well for Dr The other thing that's really handy , especially the wildlife reserve , is you need to be able to do it quietly in order to see some nature electrical floating . It's the future . Oh , and you can adjust your suspension up it down because it's got adjustable airbag suspension .This is when I pressed the off road , but so I got on or off road on . I can feel the air suspension is pumped higher . So higher ground clearance .So rather predictably , the Quattro e Tron is effective Off wrote . I haven't done exactly challenging rock crawling . But you know , there's not really any point because you're not gonna do it in this car . An off roader is more rugged . Off roader is more of you . You know , your defender , your land cruiser . A car that's built to go properly off road . But you do have that you doing off the safety net of having a will drive whenever you need it . Come ice . Come , gravel . Come , snow . Come , sand . You've got the descent . Automatic descent control . Like now if I let off my foot , just let my foot off . It knows the grading of the slope to It's slowing the car down . I can climb without any issue . It all mean this is a big ox of a car . Like I said , it's nearly two and 1/2 tons .Do you think I am I right in thinking that you guys decided to design the car and give it a look . That's familiar . So it doesn't feel too radical . Too much of a departure for maybe existing Audi . Oh , yes . You have a Q5 . Yes . You're 100% right . We had a lot of discussion about this This issue do customers want to have something radically new . Do they have to wonder radically new design , or do they want something that they used to ? And our decision , waas and our market research ? All the showed that customers want to have something that they are familiar with on at the end of the day .I believe that the best thing that can happen to electric mobility this when customers just choose , depending on their personal mobility use case , which Dr Doing is the right one and then , like they today choose between petrol and diesel . Tomorrow they might choose between petrol , diesel and the electric drive train , but nevertheless , it has to be a very , very good Audi with a ll . The other expects exactly .If you compare it to a N E V equivalent , it's actually 30 centimeters shorter than a Tesla Model X , or 13 centimeters longer than a jag I pace . But let's talk about the design for a second . This is the bill I enjoy . I think it's a pretty looking car . Actually , I think it's a better looking car in the Tesla Model X are probably prefer , probably prefer the JAG I paid for being a little bit more creative . However , you can't lose sight of the fact that Audi wants to get people out of piston cars and into Evie's . And if it looks familiar and it has that class and grace about it , which it does , then that's a good thing , if that's what you set out to achieve . But the front he got a grill , which is that familiar kind of trapper Sordell shape is Audi calls it , which is the same throughout the Audi family . It's blocked off on the top third on the bottom third , so it's only open on the middle bit on .You can't quite see it here , but if you look close behind this grill , you've got active vents behind that which will open and close electronically on this act events down in the main mouth of it down here as well . You got a camera in there underneath the bat , and you've also got the adaptive cruise control of radar here .But of course , this is This is what I want to do more and more on fully charged , I want to do more off roading because off roading , when it's electric powered is perfect . Slow speed lots of nicely , easily develop , talk , grip on on each . Remember the A Tron like the I pace like the IKI .See , Mercedes has got a front motor back motor , so each axle has its own motor . So with two engines , the rear engine a little bit stronger . 140 killer words on the front end in a little bit less power . 125 kilowatt . Right ? Okay , okay . And then you've got the my right in thinking that the suspension components this is it's air suspension on of these components from existing Audi ese . Exactly what you did with the car . This We decided to make new what has to be new , which is mainly the electric drive train on . We took the components that I have nothing to do with the electric car from our modular system that we call the MLB , where we have the suspension , which is mainly and then the brakes , mainly from the Q7 .We have , for example , the seeds from the A6 . The infotainment system is from the A8 .So we took the best Are modular system and portfolio . Exactly . It's a big portfolio . Yes , Yes . Yeah , and makes pretty much sense , because for the customer , it just has to be a very good Audi . Yeah , and I think therefore , these models are perfect talking of price .By the way , this car is gonna come up for sell for 71,000 on 1/2 1000 quitter . 71 a half �1000 . It's a lot of money . It's an expensive car and all those people out there that said that winner when Jack brought out the I pace and it was coming up for 58 59 grand basic and said , That's way too expensive . Consider this . The jag is all aluminium . The JAG is built completely bespoke evey from the ground up . Where's this ? Has lots of parts of the architecture a shared with the piston cousins .This has Q7 suspension , for example , on this is on its highest setting , so this comes with their adaptable air suspension . To standard , this is as tall as it's ever gonna get . This one's on twenties . There's 1 20 inch wheel design that which is this one . There's 2 20 ones to choose from on . One of the 21 has , like four slash cuts in it , which match these four slash cuts here in the unique headlights , which do you like ?We're charging , so you can see there's a little status light here that's telling me that we're all right . We're charging any red or any yellow . It's bad news you can't see in this bright Arab Emirates flight . But there is an led above there , which illuminates the entire charging panel , which is good for nighttime hookups . No letter .The original Quattro , back in 1979 was just called the Audi Quattro , and this is just called the Audi Tron . So it's a big milestone for Audi . I remember the original Quattro quite well .It comes a standard with led headlights . I'm pretty sure that Audi was the first car tow mass produce Carter have led . Headlights only was the first brand to bring that to market . It's got this thing called an air curtain . So this black little in lay here in a full vent , and that event channels air around here and over the wheel and then down the side .He got this quite nice kind of Indian . I like the side profile , this car . You've got an indented here , a crease which kicks down there's a waistline crease here . But then there's a lovely horns , which kicks up over the back door , handles the side profile . This car's really similar to a Q5 , but it has little features like that , which I think like the cue to which is a bit of a quirky kind of crossover , which I thinks one of the prettiest Saudis personally .Course she can't walk past them . You got these the optional . They are optional camera mirrors , virtual mirrors , whatever you wanna call them . I'm not really a fun of thumb Audi say it's the first production car tow havethe Um , when I said that in the intro , I thought , I've seen another car with it . This is the first mass produced car with a camera available . The first car I remember being in production is actually a VW group car . It's the Volkswagen Excel Want . You remember that car one or something ? It waas a technological tour de force making our way to the back . You've got these lovely , smooth Audi . You're good at this Really smooth roof bars at a quite a row on the whole aargh theme continues throughout because you've got this cut in in dent down at the bottom of the doors and again with these kind of strikes , this plastic cladding . And then , while the suspension's up on its high setting , you can see all the soundproofing in here . Can you see it all ? And there's soundproofing throughout the car , all underneath the back all And if it's a flat floor cars you'd imagine on this covers up the battery pack and everything because they've tried to make it is quiet and composed and luxurious as possible , Which is why you've got the double glazed . Decide glass on the front and the back glass is optional . Double glazed . Let's go around the back , the back off the truck . Now I like the back of this . It reminds me of the Q eight , which is a really new SUV . That's the piston engine . It's got this full with led realize , and I absolutely love it at night . It's just a solid bar . It looks absolutely gorgeous again . It's no a standout car . It's actually quite subtle . If you didn't see the E Tron badge , you just think it was a fairly handsome , well put together SUV in the boot that is 660 litres of Boots place , which is really impressive . The JAG , for example , the AARP A6 650I A6 on Like the JAG . It also has a front boom fruit bigger than a lot of cars . They don't mention any of the literature Audi that this is actually a storage areas . Well , this is purely for the cables look . So will your cabling and all your clutter , which is normally under the boot floor in the Audi . And there is an under boot floor area . This is so much more useful because if you've got a boat full of stuff , if you're on a journey , you can't get your cable down . Where's here ? They're all easily accessible . You also have on the each on this false floor . Lift up the false floor in this space here for a space saver wheel , which I think will be optional when the car goes on . So there's another little bit down there . It's not quite a flat floor entry point , but it's near his damn it flat floor you can't order is a seven seater or a 62 light . You can . The Tesla Model X on the Tesla Model X does have a bigger boot . The Tesla Model X is a bigger car . This is a 4.9 meter long car .The Model X is over five meters long , but yet the model X it a lighter car on . So is the jag I pace . It's not forget this is a steal car that's nearly two and 1/2 tonnes . 2490 kilos . That's a heavy water from a car , which is why I haven't driven it up that June because I don't want hitting it out .I really don't Okay , because the Inchon is between Q5 and Q7 and size . There's a lot of space back here for passengers .It's a five seat car . Seats look familiar , and that's because I think there are often Audi A6 appear .You've got the events , and then down there , you've got a pair of us be sockets on dhe , a 12 volt fag lighter socket . You gotta noise luxurious arm rest who are oppressed that you got a pair of cup holders , which always nice and a cheeky little Aaron here for things like pens that you've stolen from hotels or even in nutrition about Darby's got some of the flattest smoothest roads .I know . So I've stopped in the middle of the highway because it's deserted and I'm gonna do not 60 test . Are you ready ? We're in sport mode . 54321 62 5.7 seconds With boost on in sport mode dynamic setting , I've turned traction control off because , let's face it , it's a Quattro . It doesn't really need it on a hot tarmac day like this .But the more I sit in it , the more I wonder why they made this car steal . It just seems very odd when Audi pioneered aluminium construction with the A8 back in the nineties of any card , this would be the car that you'd want to make lighter , very in mind . That battery pack , which lives beneath us here , this 760LI with its crash protection , its enclosure and I realized that for 150 kilos more , that's the same weight as Honda's first generation Inside the whole car , not just the battery pack . The whole car is a heavy beast .This guy's heavy based , but the dash is gorgeous . It's going to sit in front the cockpit . It's beeping at me because I've left it on , got the seat adjusted to how I drive it , so I've just been sat behind myself . If you understand me , this is a very pleasant place to bay .There's no doubt about it . Audi cabins are just plush and gorgeous , very well appointed . You got a 10.1 inch screen up here . I think I got an eight point something in J 8.0.6 inch screen . Down here , the clarity of the screens is insane . It's a bit of an acquired taste , but all your heater controls your seat controls your climate and you're you , your descent mode and everything in the union . You now is all touch green . The only tactile button is this one , which is your volume control for your radio and your station shift . This is a sort of semi floating , pretty deep center console . It's a chunky thing I've got . You know , my notebook in here , which is large , my phone . And there's two cupholders down here , and there's even . There's even if you vertically stack it a place to wirelessly charge your phone just on the left inside here . So it's deep in there . It's quite fat fee , but it's deep and there's , Ah , there's two more U . S . Bees . Another 12 volt socket on . There's another deep cubby in here , so plenty of storage on the go . I really like this part , a real like this . It's like a strange rest rest , even though you don't need to shift gears . It's kind of what you do . If you were shifting gears and then you got your your shift a button . Is this aluminium sleight of a put my foot on the brake . Now you just knock it with your thumb into reverse or pull it back into D or into sport . And then press park on the side is lovely brushed aluminium finished throughout . This has got little subtle led lighting here , like a three stage dash with leather with really soft rubber . I'm with ultra soft rubber here , four spokes to Rome , which I really like admired that while I was driving with your trap is a little same shape as the front grill .There's a lot of similarities between this in their jag , I would say in terms of your sort of double deck screens and that kind of thing , there's no doubt that Audi do a beautiful dash you're never gonna get bored of of this level of quality .I do like the fact that the Audi intelligent navigation it will know that I'm coming up to a roundabout or a junction , and it'll start to pull back on the re generally , so I don't even have to kind of instigate more aggressive region . It'll do automatically . That's something we're seeing more and more on TV's anyway . On a car this heavy needs to capitalize on region it has to .The screens have got that haptic feedback like the latest generation phones , which does feel quite good because it's the halfway house between a physical button on a touch screen in terms of production is , is Audi confirmed figures for how many of these cars they intend to be able to build in the Brussels factory .What , what kind of quantities of cars ? Well , we do not off course , uh , tell the numbers that we see , but you can easily imagine that we have an entire factory only producing runts . It will just be just just need runs out of the personal factory on dhe . You might know that you can only run an efficient car production when you come close to , let's say , 100,000 cars a year . Eso it is pretty clear that we do not calculate with 10,000 cars a year . Yeah , because way want to earn money with those cars because otherwise the technology makes no sense , absolutely , on the feedback that we get from the markets that we get from customers , that , yes , this is exactly what customers want to buy . So we believe that this really will be a high volume product .Oh , there's a lot . Of course you got your screens here , Fear mirror . And that's the way thing about the screen , for your mirror is , it's quite low . You're looking down rather than you want to look more out . Wound down . But that's just a personal thing . I still can't quite get used to them . Somebody mentioned to me earlier on When you're driving , if you're a driver that likes your arm on your door , like best guess what is gonna happen in my eye line for that side mirror is my hand is my fist , so I have to remove my fist or drop my elbow down to look . Do we need cameras instead of mirrors ? Are they better ? My honest answer for Mei . Who's not attack . No freak per se . I don't just like the new stuff just because it's new . I just don't really see the point of it . I think it's just another thing toe put on your instagram stories and boast because there's a screen there and there's a screen . Is it helping me ? Not really .The order books for this car opened almost a year ago , I think . Yes , yes . So when we used to have you started production of these years or is that a parent to start ? We have . We have started production . Okay . Production is running . Yeah . Noodle launched the car for the customers in the first quarter off 2019 .The more I drive this and more , I'm thinking I can't wait to digest this kind of drive train and tack in amore car based down day .Like the E Tron GT-R concept , which is going into production later in 2019 . Dass the car that's gonna get my juices flowing last the car . That's your proper cuatro your proper drivers machine . Don't get me wrong . This is a very well put together car , the Tron and it's beautifully finished inside .I mean , you cannot fall Audi dashes for the finish and everything . You got your head up display Got your beautiful surfaces You brushed aluminium , your lovely screens . Amazing clarity of you Google Earth .But is it exciting ? No , really ? No , really . I feel like BMW go in there so long ago in the game came up with some beautiful radical content . The decision that the other Germans have made Mercedes-Benz these guys out toe play . It's so much more conservatively in both looks and really propulsion . Philip BMW still leading the charge . BMW didn't decided not to build an SUV . They decided to go wild .I've been driving this car now for nearly two days . I've had a love seat time , innit ?A3 rapid charges And what I think about this car is if you're an existing Audi owner and you've never stepped foot into the world of electrification , this would be a fine transition . It's a really good quality car , and there are so many aspect off the each one that I really like . But I think as a full package when you put it against its peers , it's just too expensive . And it's just too heavy on the range just isn't quite good enough to warrant the price .And I personally would want a car a little bit more involving to drive as a driving enthusiast .And on that basis , when you put it against the Tessler X and you put it against the I pace , the I pace is the winner for May . It's a cheaper car . It's a lighter car . It has no worse range , in fact , slightly better on paper . And it's amore engaging car , and I think the quality is up there on the Jag as well . But you can't take away the fact that it's great to have another big player in the game , and he's only gonna get bigger as usual , Thank you very much for watching fully charged subscribe .

175,249,R8,"That's what This thing stop that that silly ? This isn't Audi after all . They're supposed to be sensible . Roy . Well , yes . On DNO .This is the R8 , the everyday supercar , which amazed the world when it first , right back in 2006 .It was so cool , futuristic looking , that even Iron Man Tony store bought one . This is a second generation version on . It doesn't look a lot different , but then that's no bad things . It's a really head turning car , but it's not over the top of a big show off like something Italian supercar . You need more reserved . It's OD on being Audi .It's dead easy to drive to the steering . It's nice , and life was exactly where you want it . You take your box is smooth enough . These seats are nice and supple . You could even miles in them . And with the the suspension and it's comfy setting , it rides over bums pretty well . You can actually see out of it all right as well . For a supercar . You know , you've been Bill about in this thing pretty much like even in A3 .Pick up your grandmother from a bridge night and should be none the wiser . There was the 5.2 liter V 10 engine from a Lamborghini on board . The engine is mounted in the middle of the car for the perfect weight distribution , and you could get in two states of two .So �420,000 you can have 540 horsepower .Or you can pay an extra 15 grand for this 610 horsepower V 10 plus model , and it's good for 0 to 62 miles an hour . In just 3.2 seconds , we'll hit 205 miles an hour , which means that if you didn't have this kind of wing but a wing like that , it would take off on . The best thing about this engine is that , unlike modern performance cars , it's still naturally aspirated . It's got everything you want from a super car engine . It's rapid , it's responsive , and it's far more orchestral , the modern turbocharged unit . In fact , let's have a musical interlude .Driving this thing is a real sensory experience , so the gearshift , I mean , they are lightning fast on the four wheel drive system . There's just so much great from it's absolutely unbelievable and consent all of its power pretty much to the rear wheels . This means that if you turn the driver's aids off , you can do stuff like this helps . The steering is super sharp , cocking change direction faster than a house fly . And then there's the cornering speeds of this thing way corners , mind bending . It's not some unsophisticated points and go performance Audi like because of the past . You really , really feel involved in the proceedings with this new R8 Gloria's .But you know when you want to take a back seat . But he got exhort any .But you can't just sit back , calm down a little bit and relax and just enjoy the beautiful ambiance of this fabulous .Its interior is fabulous and just better thought out than the Lamborghini Hurricane's , with which it shares its chassis and engine . If the virtual cockpit is clear , logical on cutting edge .But it's not the only cool thing about the R8 his five others .The engine can decouple from the gearbox and shut down five of its cylinders . When you're cruising to , say fuel , you still be looking to get over 20 miles per gallon .The performance during will houses of the controls for the different driving modes . Exhaust flaps on the star .But there's actually a decent practicality for a supercar . You got this deep front can .There's more stories behind the seats .This new R8 is 50 kilograms lighter and 40% stiffer than the old R8 win win engaging launch control is this easy way camera gun steady , but not everything about the R8 is perfect . Here's five things that answer girl .The fuel tank isn't very big , so you'll be filling up pretty much every 200 miles .This car may cost �135,000 but adults don't charge you an extra 275 .Quit if you want cruise control .These two feet side blades are nice , but it just implies corners of big single piece items you got on the old R8 .The brilliant laser headlines automatically cancel below 37 miles an hour , so any slow for a corner you just left with normal being . It's like someone turned off the sun .Standard fit carbon ceramic brakes are absolutely mighty , but they can feel a bit grubby when you first took to the pedal .Still , these are only minor knee goes for a supercar , which is generally very super to some people on Audi is never gonna be as desirable as a Lamborghini nor a Ferrari .Yet this thing cost serious money on the options are really expensive , but they all right is just brilliant to drive in all conditions on dhe .It looks fantastic .Now , if you click on the card in the top right hand corner of the screen , you can find out more information on the best deal you can get on Audi R8 Accardo dot co dot uk .Thanks for watching .

176,250,Q8,"so there's a new top of the range Audi in town . Except right now , it's not in town . As you can see , it's a wilderness Chilean Atacama Desert , which is where Audi has chosen to launch the new Que A8 luxury SUV . As you do now , do not adjust your sets . You have not watched a first drive review video on this car before , although you might think you have to believe it or not . This is the sick , large SUV from the elephant time Volkswagen Group on the same MLB Evo platform to belongs in the last three years . It follows the Q7 sister car , but also better Mantega , the Volkswagen Tor , a Porsche Cayenne on the Lamborghini . Orestes Q3 isn't like a lot of those others CDs because it's sort of half SUV half four door grand touring Cooper .So it's got frameless doors on dhe . Hello , roof line . Big features on flat arches trying to look a bit more desirable than the average big family come from some angles , you will , you will have noticed .It does look quite a lot like a Lamborghini yours , and interestingly , if you talkto Audi designers about that car , they'll tell you that it was the cue . A8 project started first in the Lamborghini that piggybacked on their efforts . So without cue A8 , there would be no Horace . Or maybe that's just what they want us to believe .Curries wider , slightly lower to the ground and shorter . Overall done . The Q7 sister car on which it's based .It launches in the UK later this summer with only one engine , three litre , 50 TD I , which will be a mild hybrid diesel . There will be less powerful diesel on a more powerful petrol coming next year . You get lots of lots of active , chatty technology with the car . Either of thunder was an option , so there's proper centered if placed . Four wheel drive on adaptive sport tuned air suspension as standard . If you move up to the higher end bosh bronc trim , you also get four wheel steering , just about every active safety system known to man prices for the sort of midrange diesel .We're gonna start at about 65,000 moving up to just north of 80,000 for the car with all the bells and whistles on . That's actually a lot of money , but it's pretty competitive when you look a like for like examples of Ranger Vela , BMW X6 , the Maserati Levante . There is no like for like a Porsche Cayenne anymore , because Portia no longer makes diesels . But there you go . That's just the crazy world .We live inside the car . The Q A8 sort of picks up where out his latest big saloons , A6 A7 A8 left off leathery and creamy , very high end , very expensive feeling .The entertainment set up sort of dominates the driving environment or a couple of touch screens , one above the other one slightly bigger than the other . They're actually pretty imposing , but they're actually pretty easy to use , and they certainly look pretty sophisticated along with those who want to get out his virtual cockpit display between the three . At times , it is more like you're flying some kind of low level private jet than driving a car . It's all very high tech for to drive .The car is it's very sporty . It's got plenty of performance . It's just not quite up there . But the level off your Range Rover Sport S v r for you , Cayenne turbo or even sort of a high end Ranger of the Vela First sort of driver involvement on performance level . It's just not quite been allowed to hit that mark yet . I suspect that's mostly to do with engine range , so there's no V8 petrol turbo option for now .So the performance level of the car and it's sort of handling appeal . It's not quite up there with your Porsche Cayenne turbos or your Range Rover sport S T Ells having said that , counts good at what it does . It's got a nice broad range of dynamic ability , so it could be comfy at 11 moment and then fast and agile enough the next moment and it's listen , it's It's a big luxury .Audi eats at the moment . It's not really aiming to take on the Cayenne turbos on the Range Rover S5 yards off this world . Fair enough . But there is just this lingering suggestion for the moment of unfulfilled potential about this car . You know how he wanted to make a really big statement with an all new flagship vehicle , which is effectively what this car is . I think it could have just dialed the design of a little bit more . You could have given us that real flagship version of the car from the get go wait . Have all been standing here sort of saying , Wow , I never expected that . As it is , a car is a desirable large luxury SUV . But I'm not sure you look at it on dhe . You're amazed by it . I'm not sure it's quite up there from a sort of a styling appeal on the level off arranger of a fella , and it's certainly no , they're with Can Turbo wait ."
177,251,SQ7,"Welcome to the inside of an Audi s Q7 where , if I may need to talk some numbers , quite few numbers of some significance . 1 435 metric horsepower for 29 to 2300 kilos or thereabouts . A3 A7 seats standard as A4 lead to V8 62 miles an hour in 4.9 seconds . Cost 70,000 quid . And then there's the most significant numbers of all . �664 for torque . Problem . 1000 all P m . Which is an astonishing about talk from no reps effectively over . That's just just over Idol . I cannot think of another car that develops pick talk from 1000 revs . Accept something like an electric car , which cost of us picked off from no red settle .Now , the way Audi he's done that has got this four litre V8 twin turbo charged diesel engine . It's got sequential turbo , so one gets going early than an exhaust valve opens . A certain reds on the other Turbo kicks into , but from low revs . It has an electrically operated compressor , no electric turbocharger because it because it's not doing what it does . But it's doing compressing . It's chucking in the air because it's electric and it spins up very quickly from north to 70,000 rpm mean 1/4 of a second . I believe that means there is almost no Audi says , almost no turbo lag . Well , quite shocking the gearbox across into manual mode and leave it there and then go from very low ribs . I put my foot down . There is acceleration in a manner that you just don't get in a turbocharged car . Turbo charges just spit back quickly in response to throw numbers . They just don't do it . Was it 48 votes ? Well , to get enough power , so you're gonna have to increase The current switch . Can't do because you love with massively thick cables . Or you have to increase the voltage , which you could do by families . There's a four liter V eight engine in the front , so if you want to generate some power , you can so as well as the normal 12 of battery . This car also has a 48 volt lithium ion battery in the boot . Audi also uses it in uncoupling to go in a straight line . This S8 Q7 has loose anti robots . And then , as you turn a corner , it uses a 48 volt resistance motor effectively to tighten things up and really minimized body roll . Bentley Bentayga does exactly the same . Exactly the same thing on this engine . Really Sounds maker actually going through some drive by , put it into dynamic . I get a bit of extra waffle from the exhaust , is gonna suppose it back there doesn't place with speakers , but it just laments the noise of it .It sounds good . It sounds especially purposeful . Are idle . It sounds like a big powerful . How about Audi VOC Audi face or something ? Yeah , you can hear it , probably because it sounds .My is quite possibly the nicest sounding diesel engine in production , that the rest of the package is ovary Audi Q7 . So it's pretty nice inside . It feels like a tall estate car , if you like , rather than a lout . Four by four . And that's a deliverer . Audi think people like the fact that it has these high window lines does . It is very difficult to see where the bonnet ends .Q7 . I mean , any 2.3 ton SUV . To be fair , perhaps . Sport . Cayenne aside , it's not exactly a driver's come , but the sophisticated electronic systems make a significant difference when this is still not a great drivers guard into fast Audi . So it's got slightly numb steering . Really , really . It's very peculiar . It's not natural easy car to drive , but it's very quiet , very refined . But make no mistake . Although the application of the 48 volt system is not , perhaps I did at its most brilliant here there is no arguing with the actual principle of it itself .Audi is going to Fort Z8 . Most fail before very long . Everybody will have it . And it's not just turbo charges .Compresses suspension systems . It'll extend through to telematics will extend through two semi autonomous driving . When electronics couldn't take over steering and braking and stuff like that . It just has the extra capacity to do a lot more for you .So , yeah , should you , by an ex Q7 . I'm not sure I should . Do you think it is a very significant car ? Absolutely ."
178,252,A3,"this third generation Audi A3 is not just significant for being the first all new model since 2003 of this really big selling model . It's actually really interesting for its platform . This is the first model from the VW group to get the new multipurpose M Q B platform . This architecture is so flexible it can be used to underpin anything from a super Millie right through to an executive saloon , and it will be used in the vast majority of the W group models in the future . This means that the cars will share more parts than they do currently on can share production lines , saving VW loads of money . Which is a bit ironic because we w group is the last car maker out there that needs it at the moment , having made �9.4 billion in 2011 .So basically the A3 has no choice but to be absolutely outstanding , and the good news is that actually , it is quite a step forward . In particular , the ride seems to be a lot more pliant here . We're driving a two litre TD I 148 brake horsepower model , and we've got the seven speed , double clutch s Tronic gearbox .All of which adds up to over �24,000 in the UK , which is quite expensive .Having said that is well equipped , it's really refined , and it does feel really lovely inside , which is such an important thing for the A3 . It's a really premium feeling car on Dhe . Actually , I think the interior is one of the biggest step forwards for it .I would like a bit more life to the steering sport . Models get Audi , Dr Select a standard , which means that you can have a sort of dynamic setting or a comfort setting or a variety they're off in steering on the gearbox , although the dampers are actually passive . But even in dynamic mode , it still feels a bit steroid or you don't get much feel to it . It flows along the road really nicely , and there's loads of grip . Even in this front wheel drive model , you can get Quatro on the TV studio .I would also say that the gearbox could maybe be a bit more intuitive . It's fine if you're just cruising along and also mode , but if you want anything a bit more vigorous . It could be a bit lazy .Even taking all those needles into account , Theo A3 is actually still quite an exceptional thing .It's refined , lovely place to bay is packaged by , well , really efficient T T T I and manual will do 106 grams per kilometer or 119 with the auto , which is really impressive .There's just nothing that really grabs me about this car .A one's got a bit of fun about it in this car , and some people might miss it , but I suspect not . I suspect it will still be a massive cellar . And I think Audi have done a great job of just updating things that needed updating . Really ?So ultimately , while I wouldn't say that this is necessarily the enthusiast choice , certainly not with this engine . I think the A3 is exactly what it needs to be on . Also particularly given the right . I think it's a really good sign for the M Q B platform . I suspect the A3 will be a huge success"
179,253,Q5,"the Audi Q5 . They're like cactus in Mexico . You see them everywhere . That's because it's the world's most popular midsize premium SUV .Now this is the all new Q5 .Audi makes him pretty bold claims about his performance drivability on technology .And so this video will be testing these claims out in a very scientific fashion because , after all , I'm a scientist . I am . I've got chemistry degree . That means that if this motoring journalist thing doesn't work out , I can always start breaking bad .Some people may complain the new Q5 looks rather similar to the old Q5 on that it has lain fake exhausts , others maybe a gas that it's now made in Mexico , not Germany .Thankfully , though , it's built in the Volkswagen Groups X and MLB Evo Platform , which is also used for the A4 on Q7 . And that means it weighs up to 90 kilograms less in the old Q5 .Yes , I can verify that it does indeed feel lighter , uh , less weight means better economy and combined with the revised engines a new cuatro ultra or will drive , which can decouple the rear wheels when cruising to boost efficiency . This two litre diesel could do 56 mpg that members actually best in class . But what's the reality ? Well , I've been cruising around for a bit , and I took the cars trick computer , and it's saying I'm doing 48 months per gallon so it's all right . But it's hardly going to save the planet , is it ? Lightness also helps performance on this 190 horsepower TV I should be able to get nor to 60 miles an hour in an impressive 7.9 seconds . So let's see . I'm gonna put the current dynamic mode for maximum throttle response , but the gearbox into sports mode . So it's got fast dishes from the same speed auto . Hold on the brake throttle . Then go that six day . Yes , but just how fast was that ? Let's find out .I did not . To 16 8.1 seconds only 0.2 of a second off his claim in any way . For most customers , there are more important things than performance , such as practicality .There's new Q5 . It started Long , got wider on taller than its predecessor on Daddy says it's got back that much more knee and head room in the back , so it actually has class leading rear passenger space . Anything is , though , this big lump in the floor means that I don't think it is good for carrying three in the back as a Landrover Discovery sport . Also , Landrover Discovery Sport comes with sliding on dhe reclining rear seats . Standard . Where's their optional on this Q5 ?Also , the Land Rovers boot is bigger than the Audi is is still impressive in any way .The Q5 kills its rivals interior quality . This is a beautifully made and well designed cabin on it's positively dripping with technology .They Q5 infotainment system is really , really slick steadies to use on .You can connect to the Internet and use Google maps for the satnav , though I can't show you here because we don't have any mobile signal where we are in Mexico . What I can show you is that you get the car with Apple carplay on droid auto as well as leading the field in terms of tech .Audi says any Q5 is also the most aerodynamic midsize SUV on this , Plus , an acoustic windscreen keeps it nice and quiet inside , so we're driving along at Constant 50 miles an hour . I've got sound mito app running on my phone . I'm just gonna shut up for a second . Get reading .That's it . There we go on it saying it's 68 Desa Bells , which apparently is the same sound level as a normal conversation of three feet .You can get the Q5 with two types of optional upgraded suspension normal springs with adaptive dampers , or , for the first time or round air suspension , which is what this car has , and it's comfy is setting its super wolf tea . Now we're driving along rather bumpy Road , once again doing 50 miles an hour on Dhe got vibrato on it on my phone , and it's reading A5 now . In case you're wondering , I did a similar test in Audi A8 on a similar road . Same speed for another video , and that's pretty much the same figure that I got the A8 . So , yes , this new Q5 is as comfy as an A8 limousine . It's not bad , however public are in dynamic mode , and the air suspension lowers and stiffens to make the cube . I feel as a man from Audi told me 40 yard for a tall car , it doesn't roll about much in the corners . That steak is nice and sharp on it grips well as well . Thanks partly to that cultural will drive system Now , I reckon you can hustle this thing along a twisty road pretty much as fast as you can and Audi A4 Saloon Now I'd never described it as being a huge laugh to drive , but , you know , for X3 V8 , I'm actually impressed . The air suspension also lets you raise the car up by around 70 millimeters over the dynamic setting useful . If you want to head off road and into the Mexican desert , just be careful what he reads .Or you may end up on a different kind of trip and in need of assistance .Speaking of which , the new Q5 gets out his latest driver , assistant systems . The objective Cruise control with Jackie Chan assist will automatically brake , accelerate and even steer the car for you , so long as you don't take your hands off the wheel for too long .Wow , that's amazing .What's also amazing ? Something extra Q3 get with a car such as matrix led headlamps with pulsating indicators , a bang and Olufsen stereo .Wallace charging for your mobile phone .They'll be careful with the options when you may have to sell your cactus stash to pay for the car .Overall , the new Audi Q5 is a really good or and midsize SUV on . It's certainly one of the best in class .Any problem is it's a little bit expensive . It starts from �37,000 . Now , if you look up there , it's got a car way dot co dot uk . You compare office from dealers and buy a price you're confident in on . On average , people save �3600 on a new car . A3 call Wiebe . Now all we gotta do is figure out way to afford on these Q5 .I think I need to head back to that mobile chemistry lab , enjoy this video , please like it and share it and click on our logo to subscribe to the channel , click on the video windows to watch our reviews of the Mercedes GLC and Jack your pace"
180,254,RS4,"the problem with ultra fast Audi is is you never quite know what you're going to get . We love the R8 almost as much as we lows . The TT rs earlier this year , we were quite disappointed by the Rs three despite last year being pleasantly surprised by the RS5 . What then , to make of this the all new RS4 event ? Well , we're here in a very rainy Austria to find out .So what makes this RS4 different to the last ? Well , the good news is the one thing that isn't different about it or is very different about it is the V8 4.2 liter into none of this small capacity twin turbocharged , downsized nonsense .Here you get the full fat 8250 rpm V8 , which is fantastic theme main differences . Well , obviously this is the new generation off A4 . You can't get it with a manual gearbox . The old one was only manual . You have to have this seven speed s tronic paddle shift transmission . But you do get a more sophisticated four wheel drive system , Mom with a crown wheel opinion centre differential which consent up to 85% off the power to the rear wheels , which in theory at least should make it rather better to drive in the last RS4 .The bad news is because they've stuck all this extra stuff on the car . They've also added quite a lot of weight . This car weighs nearly 1800 kilos .The last one weighed just over 1700 killers , Audi says , is actually faster one and claims and North 62 times , 2/10 faster . But I think that's because it's got to paddle shift and it's got launch control , not because the car is inherently any quicker .It's just talk a little bit about the bad stuff . Get that out of the way , right ? Even here in Austria is really quite firm . I worry about it when it gets back to the UK . The RS5 got quite a big kicking . All those good can't . We liked it for the quality of it is right , and this one doesn't feel to be on awful lot better . So we'll have to wait and see what that's like when we get home . Also , these things dynamics during just don't have anything to do with it . It doesn't add anything to the car and It just makes the cut steering feel Lytton horrible and devoid of field when you're going slowly . So that's the best of the good stuff .Well , the good news is there's actually quite a lot more good stuff , bad stuff . This is actually a really , really good car . Good RS5 Audi . You've got this lovely engine . Although I would rather have three pedals and a stick . I have to say the S tronics transmission is really good . Really quick , really smooth , really fast .But I think the best thing about it may be the most surprising thing is any Iram went RS5 Audi is every time you pointed them anywhere . No corner , they just went over there somewhere . They just wanted to go straight on . They didn't want to turn in , just understood that balance in the car . Now I'm on quite wet roads over here , so maybe it'll be different when it's dry . But this car has real balance . It turns in nicely . And if you turn the trick so you can actually balance the car trouble and if you really want to , you can go very sideways . Indeed , I'm not used to rs . Audi is behaving like that and I think it's fantastic . But if you won't do in the environment is correct , you can't .Where does this new RS4 stand in ? The pantheon of good , bad and sometimes thoroughly in different Audi is that we've seen from the RS brand over the last almost 20 years . Well , I'd say it was definitely one of the better ones .It does those things that all artists have always done .It's fast , it's well built , is good looking .But on top of that , it adds an element of driver satisfaction that is really pretty rare among cars like this .Would I have it over ? Its closest unable Mercedes-Benz 60 three AMG possibly know the Mercedes is more expensive , but so , too , doesn't have much greater sense of occasion .It's a more comfortable car to better drivers .Kind . It's got that magnificent 6.2 liter V8 , innit ?But among the RS6 will be made over the last 18 years . I'd say this isn't just one of the better ones . I'd say it was one of the best on that . Audi can be truly proud"
181,255,A6,"all you Audi A6 , maybe substantially lighter than its predecessor . But has Audi finally delivered a midsize executive saloon ? We prefer to drive over the rivals from Jaggi Mercedes-Benz BMW . Making the case today is the front wheel drive to do entertainment .Now the harsh reality is a front wheel drive chassis is always gonna struggle to ride the level of engagement you get from rear wheel drive .But in terms of writing , handling this new A6 does represent a big jump of an ability over the old model .On the level of performance from refund you get from the refire . Two litre diesel motor is only better by that of the band of you 5 20 days .Practicality inside the new A6 is surprisingly spacious , getting close to trading on the toes of the standard wheelbase A8 . But that is a drawback .And that's that on right hand drive models like this that pedals are significantly offset value for money just over 30 grand .For this Essie model , you A6 fractionally more expensive M5 20 d , but it does match the BMW for consumption and CO .Two making joint best in class , so we'd still recommend the BMW five series or Mercedes E class over the A6 , The gap is now closer . That's ever been before . This latest version much improved over the prudence at a major disadvantage . Now , is that offset driving position ? That 92nd verdict is four stars ."
182,256,TT,"This is the new Audi TT , which is third generation . This is T . T s is the reason of any S4 the standard T .And the reason is because if this car we just got the similar 306 horsepower forces into two litre engine is going far , it's got the same sort of four will drive our train that can work anything up to 100% to the rear . She's very confused . It is anything like the way .First of all , what's it like inside ? Well , as you would expect , it's an Audi is beautifully appointed fit and finish his first right designed really intelligently . Actually , they've got this new digital dial's satnav screen all in the middle of it will be on everything before long . It works tremendously well , and the rest of the finish these well , that's what Audi does well is that they do interior quality .Well , they do less well in the TT is rear seat combination , but he's a hatchback . So is one of the more practical who plays around , and so to how it drives .That's not necessarily traditionally something that Audi is done brilliantly either . But on this tea first you've got a car that drives pretty much as well as inland . Is it as good as a Volkswagen Golf R ? I think probably not . The steering is still a little bit like a little bit , a little bit remote . There's not much in the way of sort of feedback and feel through it , but it's much better than other teams . On the chassis is a similar sort of a similar sort of thing , really . It doesn't have solidity and the ground covering pounding this of a goal far , it feels , feels actually a little bit a little bit lighter , a little bit more , more agile , possibly slightly more loosely so , to the extent arguably slightly less rewarding for point . But it does do things very , very well turns in crisply for the first time . This is a TT that if you turn it in on its nose , standing on the brakes , rear will actually sort of let it give you a little bit of adjustability mid corner and I can't remember the last time I felt a TT that really did that with any great enthusiasm . I didn't really expect that . To be honest , I didn't expect to be backing down this mountain road . I'm thinking , you know , they're on too many front , biased four wheel drive cars that I would rather be doing down here in these for the first time . A8 problem sports ."
183,257,R8,"here . Auto car . We are big fans of Audi ease R8 . We named it Britain's best drivers come a few years ago , and ever since then we've wondered just what a more hard core , track focused variant would be like . There is . It's called GT-R , and it is based on the V 10 . Very , it's got all the usual stuff . Has got a polycarbonate rear window carbon fibre here coming over their carbon fiber bumpers , the overall weight saving his 100 kilograms power is up through two electronics by 30 horsepower . Prices up of it , too . 145 grand . But all 33 coming to the UK , despite that are sold . So they see what it's like .So what else is different ? It was an awful lot off carbon fiber in here , natty red seatbelt on new seats , which contribute quite a lot to the weight loss you would think fire up .It's not any louder than a standard feet , and he doesn't feel it so far , and we've only got the automated manual transmission rather than a full manual . So it's on ESPN and sport on where we go .They were at the place called Lighten Park which is a new it's driving circuit . Never been here before . Quite interesting . Little track spilt , especially A4 road cars . So this track was road gun should be ideal around .It feels pretty quick , faster under standard . All right , as you would expect when the noise gets going , it gets going . Sorry , that status still ribs toe X6 X6 peak power the same 0.8000 has performed . There's extra 34 about . So this is a 152 great horsepower supercar now , because it weighs 1500 kilos . That makes it extremely fast .All the power away . The extra power comes at the top end . The talks only up �8 foot and that's it . The same sort of 6000 revs before . So this car is all about the top end .And although I'm not usually a massive fan of automated gearboxes , automated manuals , this'll one is pretty good . Actually , when you're really on it , it bunks the ships through probably here fairly quickly .But is this a driver's cards ? And max , you say a 9 11 GT-R A3 GT-R three .Our race all right . Certainly , certainly not . It's still no White is involving . The steering is light . Responsive , inaccurate , but it's not as ingrained and encrusted with feel a za 9 11 Also , it still moves around just a little bit more on its springs .What is X dreamily , spectacularly , is its ability to change direction .It's so agile , this car for a car that's still ways by a couple of 100 kilos than a GT three .You just try . Ella breaks in , planted it on its nose on it just melts on them because it's got a Rhea buys four wheel drive system . You could use the power to bring the background . Still go a little bit extra from Just pull it straight if things get a bit carried away .So adjustable from the engine Supergirl so adjustable control . And although it's not like a GT three RS where you could just take the number plates off it and go racing , what it does do is involved and engaged .You know , I think the 33 people that bought these in the UK they have an absolute ball in them . I think they're gonna absolutely love him ."
184,258,Q3,"This is the new Audi Q3 , and it's a little bit like a man bag in the way that it's trendy on dhe . Usefully practical . One of this isn't so practical that I can fit my iPod , innit ? Some striving to current anyway , decided Q3 .It's a premium machine , so it isn't The cheapest thing starts from just over �30,000 .

It really highlights the car's strong creases and look at these rear haunches . Very muscular is a smart looking car .I'm gonna take this off . Thistles not trained yet . All It's very poor example of a man bag , but this is a great example of a small SUV because , yes , it may be small , but it's actually got a decent size boot Facts from the biggest boots for this size of car . Yes , there's a little bit of a lift to lift things over , but you get this nice , posh , shiny scuff plates so you don't scratch that beautiful blue paint work when you drag your luggage out on book Boot is a nice square shaped different storage areas down there , and down there you have tether points as well to tie things to which is great hooks to hang things off . And look at this lovely feature . Good old Audi . You can wedge the false floor applied to mess around down here . Now you can't get it with a space saver spare wheel . This one actually has what looks like a somewhat for for that graded stereo system here in the boot . But that is detectable . If you need the space , this one doesn't have a spare well like I say , it's got the tire sealant group , which isn't great , but it's an extra storage areas round there . If you need that Andi look , you can , of course , lower the boot for just a bit more capacity that you're probably best leaving it up like that if you wanted to lower the rear seats . Problem is , when you come to loathe those receipts , you have to walk around to the back . Which is a bit annoying is that leaves right down at the sea , Bass said . Cock around that . It's just bear with me . Bear with me . Imagine dealing with a bunch of restless children or shopping and having to do this nightmare . That's one oversight . Audi wish it had leaves in the boot to lower those seatbacks . Well , look , once you've load them . Nice , flat , spacious , spacious floor . Denny's decide things right to the front of the car . Now I just put the seats back .It was quite handed , but the secret exit can illustrate that the doors are relatively wide , and that doesn't help when you do stuff like messing around with a child seat trying to get in , so to release seatbacks . Once we have to pull the lever actually locked down in place , which is quite good . But it's Z4 gonna come over here to do it that seek , lock that down as well . Now , here in the back of the door . It's quite all right . But that's because , of course , look yes , you know it . They do recline , and they recline quite a way to put this one down as well . Yeah , it's nice . And even then I can show you just how much room there is back here . So plenty off Henry . Look , mourning the death of my hand . Lots of knee room as well . I can actually take advantage of that nearly 412 by sliding the bench forward so you could , you know , sacrificing nearly wanted a bit more boots based on the actually need it . Foot wells . The biggest Well , so it's very , very comfy . You sit quiet at 90 degrees that is , sitting on a stool , which is good , so it makes it just a bit more comfy . On longer journeys on DDE life , you need to carry three people in the back of one's . Yes , there is this humping the floor , but it's not too . Why that's quite narrow . So this'll in the foot room on DDE , even in the middle local got this amount of headroom . Yes , you can carry three adults in the back of this car for short distances , and it's absolutely fine . Kids A3 . No problem . Little kids will also like this look , so the window line isn't too high . You've got big glass there . There's another one here on Dhe . If I put the window down , goes away so you can leave your arm at last . That's nice news .Or so is the fact that you've got your coat hook there so it doesn't get in the way . Sometimes that there look , there's even a 2nd 1 here , actually , other little useful features . So you got some nets in the seatback , which they bit flimsy , actually , but they're large , so you can put my iPad pro in there . This is just a normal sized iPad here you have on our missing , or that just feels expensive and solid , and I like the fact that the cup holders are covered , so when not in use , it's no annoying your arm . If you arrest on those cup holders , look everyone . Let's make sure stories down here by the sea to say , and you can fit a bottle in there . No problem . It'll show you this as well . Look , if I press this , you got three way folding seats so you can actually have two people either side . We still decent amount of room carry longer items such a skis off whether you want to carry furniture for my care . What I have you Now look it up a two liter bottle fitting in the back door Bins should 20.1 last thing . Outlook . The eyes fixed covers are removable on their bit awkward to do , and you put it lose those . But that's my only complaint , really , actually quite easy for a child seat in the back of here . For more detail on this car's practicality , click on the pop out banner ship , then top rank on the screen or for the late below the video to watch my detail practicality video . So I'll show you just how easy it is to fit a child seat back here . How much stuff you can cram into this cause on what it's like with red dots in the back . Let's move into the front .I'll take my water bottle with me , because if you think the back door bins a big than the ones in the front , even larger Audi isn't a good job in terms of practical Audi .So here's a flask fits in easy , but there's room for that little ball on the flask , which is incredible in terms . The other storage . Well , there's bits . Unpleased with bits are not . So look . So you got some extra storeys down here . Plenty of space in that secret couple just down by the steering wheel . Glove box is a reasonable size yet that's fine on a little doll there , so you can actually put the air condition called into there . If you want to call some drinks now , teach me this at the way here from the almost . It's not the greatest space , not much room . Then you have the cup holders . Hehe on . The weirdest thing is that it looks like it should have a cover over it . For when you don't want the cup holders . It's just a bit messy and scrappy , you know , thought that I'd ever thought about doing that just for the aesthetics on dhe migrates problem with having cup holders there is that sometimes you got manual car , they get in the way of the dish . It if you've got a tall drink in there , very , very large lot of some of the storage bits and pieces here . Another storage tray down there , which I suppose you can put your mobile phone into if you want to . But once again , he could do with having the slide over it to cover it up . It's handy having a mobile phone , because then you got your USB normal USB input there , or a brand new U . S . B . C there , which is just far more modern and speaking modern . Its interior is very , very up to date .It's a really nice design . I like the way that you got the slabs . The entertainment system looks great as well , the way it's integrated into the dash . He's got this huge screen .This car's got the digital drivers display as well , and that comes a standard truly could see can control most of the cost features through it , just using the steering wheel buttons so you can show you sat nav map there and you can change the view to make it nice . and big or smaller and control the radio very , very easy to use . Then there's the main entertainment system , so to touch screen , it's very easy to just walk through the different menus . Then the problem is , is that it's a little bit lower down . So you end up taking eyes off the road , probably for a bit longer than he should , or if the screen was up . There likes a nice and easy to use , and if you don't want to use the normal obvious system , you can quite easily connect the car . Then use Android Auto or Apple carplay , and he's mapping off your phone . And some of your friends are . Perhaps the only problem with doing that is that you don't actually have the satnav running in this display here , which is a shame , because that's just easy to use as you're driving Now , from what you tell him is causing retirement system . Click on the pop out there only by the video , and then you can watch my detailed entertainment system video review and also want to show you a bit more about the interior design of this car .So let's talk about the quality because generally , it's really , really good . So you got super soft materials here on the dash . Everything feels very , very solid . This sport is steering wheel you get with their slide model fills lovely , expensive , but there's a little bit odd . So look at this . The door tops . They're quite hard . It's nowhere near soft on the dash , and usually it expected to be . However , I do like this metal designed the way it works into the door handle and the way they built the door handles .So normally you have to use a door handle light , which is a little bit of natural . This when you can slide the fingers through underneath lot . The name on the door . I'm not 70 Z8 God , that beeping . Just get on your nerves . But it does stop you from leaving your keys in the car , so I'll give it that .However , back to the designs , there's some other things I don't like . Frances , look , this big panel here's just got nothing on it . I mean , why is that other than that , the ergonomics of brilliant .So all the buttons you need to hear and there's a couple over here all very easy to get to and just in a sensible place , another freighter like is that they don't have a physical sync button to sync up the dual zone climate control , which is standard by the way and said , What you do is just press the auto , but hold it until it flashes like that and it means it sinks and then look into the temperatures together . And then if you just turn that one , it will go on . It says he got jewels own again . I want to see this as well . Look , I love the touch sensitive lights on their led bulbs . Not so horrible Philemon balls for the nice , bright , clear light .Everything I like about this car , if you want to , you can sit quite low in it . Say it feels just like a slightly grownup hatchback . But the seventh hi adjustment in the sea that you can then transform it to quite a high driving position like you'd expect from an SCV . And because there's plenty of head room , you're able to do that even if you're quite so . If there's so much adjustment in this seat , any problem we have with it is this is the optional electric seats that depending on how you tilt the button , it kind of all moves in different ways in spending ages , trying to , like , get the exact angle and how you want it . That's my only complaint because of seats are quite nice , as is the driving position itself . Loads of interest . But as you can see in the steering world , so you're not gonna have any problems getting comfortable at all in this car .Now , as standard , this line gets sporty seats , which are leather trimmed . Yes , Line also gets a aluminium pedals as well , which is nice and sport as well as bigger alloy Willis .Whether than that speck is pretty much the same as the engine level sports , you get stuff like reversing sensors , dual zone climate control and led headlights and tail lights Pricewise life .So this particular car I've got here , I put the details into the coma configuration . Hers is 1.5 petrol automatic s lying . Now , this car should cost from just over �34,000 . But I've got nothing back for just under �33,000 . Now , if you want to see how much you could save money , call what you try Our configuration . I just click on the pop out . Bandits are blank on the screen on only below the video or just Google car Wow , Audi Q3 . And then you could just use their configuration and just build the car . You could build any car you want and see what the best offers you can get back away from the comfort of your own home that I'm a tackle now .Then it's time for the car . Wow , A5 annoying things about this car .There's far too many fake events on this car . Presence here at the front look illustrated with the Carli stick of truth . These go nowhere . There's more here in the back . Look , go nowhere . Worst thing , though , is this . Look , the fake exhausts .Audi is just getting so bad for these flake exhausts This college really cool with screen off because you just have this black shiny panel that is so long you haven't just been operating a touch screen because then this is covered in fingerprints . I mean , look at this .Yeah , exactly .Audi is badging . Policy is just a little bit odd these days . In the past , the number on the back related to the size of the engine . So 2.0 was a two liter , 1.4 was a one point . For now , the number relates to the engine's power . But 35 doesn't relate to the facts about A5 horseback that me too little nor 35 Giller wants . It's just beans . A low wish power at port , where the higher number means a prior one .Yeah , already confusing R8 a sitting position in this car on the location . The ignition means that when you're driving along , your knee is constantly touching this far . But it's really annoying , so you might want to take that off . There's various on blanked out panels around the car's interior . I'm not sure what they A4 , but it con amazing . Think there's some options that are fitted princes on the doors . You have these little inserts . Very strange . And then there's another one down here , which is where you probably hoped to find some USB imports . Your mobile devices ?Don't worry . There's still plenty to like about this car . Here's the car Wow A5 core features .If you get the optional interior ambient lighting , then you can change the color of different parts of the trim . Such a lucky move , various different schemes as you like . But my favorite bit is that it also changed the color of this Audi badge on here . That is just super cool . Do you know that ?But why just tickles me . You can fit the low cover from the boot underneath the fools .Hello Ice affix anchor points on the front passenger seat , which means you can carry three child seats in this car .Sandy , if you got triplets , you get the Quattro version of this car . I consent to 85% of the engine's power to the back wheels . Also , you can fit the car with an optional sport rear differential for you .Better corn exiting traction you won a free space in the global group of this is actually a special storage pouch with manual just under different passenger seats .Keeps him started A8 First thing I should point out about this . Audi Q3 is the on driving the S line version that has lowered stiffened suspension and it is quite firm over bumps , but a bit like an orthopedic mattress . It's not uncomfortable . It's all right . You can't d selected and have the normal suspension off the sport model , which is a bit softer and it might be worth doing , actually , alternatively , can pay extra and get deductive suspensions at a press of a button . You could put it into comfort mode . It's really comfy or president button when he goes into sports mode , and then it's stiff from firmer . The steering is really good . The way is not to sensitivity , just turning a bit . But then the more you turn it , the Maur responsive , insensitive it becomes . Which means you could get from full look the full lock in just two turns of the wheel . So it's dead easy to maneuver around town . That means it's not too flighty when you don't want it to bay yet is responsive when you do , you want it to be , which is great . Was not so great , though , is the automatic gearbox . In fact , if I stop the car , so let's say we're a junction or around about not certainly need to get that Gap floored it . Fraud it . Now it's going . It's really unresponsive . This gearbox . I don't like it at all this automatic . It's not great for money . Cruising along at speed but round town can't get on your nerves .Ah , this particular car driving has the 1.5 A8 turbo petrol engine just enough power to get you back around town on you keep with the traffic on the motorway . The problem I have with it , though , is that what isn't only quiet quiet When you put your foot down red eye , it does complain a law . It starts , you know , economy wise on get in 37 mpg . It could be a little bit better . Actually , this car is better suited to the two little D's on here in two states to the heart of ocean or low powered version of the past . Fine . You get that car with the automatic gearbox . If you want , it would be better with the auto with diesel has got more low down pulling power . Also , you can get it with four world drivers . Well , if you need some extra great , but actually the two will drive version , which this car is is absolutely fine , grips well enough and they see plan to do some kind of mold off roading . There's also some high powered petrol models , but they get a little bit expensive , even though they are quite quick when he cruising on the motorway . In this car , it's relaxing . It's very , very stable speed on it .It's not too noisy to order that much . Tire noise from the road you get will be a wind flutter around here , but it's not too bad .Generally , this is a very quiet Carter traveling quieter than a BMW X1 you might be thinking , Oh , yeah , but Matt , they've been to the X1 more clearly . Handle better when you approached him corners ? Well , actually , no , it won't . This Q3 . It's sharper to drive , just grip better , and it's more intuitive . How it handles really quite good , actually , For this kind of car just grips and goes round . It helps that this one's got the sporting suspensions . That's a payoff for that extra kind of firmness stops the car leading in the bends . And then there's the shop staring . Now it's really good that it feels very planted in pointy . I'm quite surprised how well this car actually goes around corners to tell you the truth . Definitely a lot better in the old Q3 .

185,259,RS5,"Audi is most definitely a car company with the wind in its sales right now on this latest creation , the frankly rather scary looking RS5 could well be its crowning glory . For this is a car that has 444 on , which could do 117 4 miles an hour . If you pay Audi enough to unleash its Elektronik limiter . It also has a seven speed dual clutch gearbox as standard alongside one of the most sophisticated four wheel drive systems ever seen in a road car . And so we come to the potentially thorny issue of price . Well , this is very interesting because �54,000 the RS5 is undeniably more money than it's obvious rivals from Mercedes and BMW . But it has miles more equipment , and that has more power . So in theory , it could be the best of the lot .A4 theory is one thing , but what is this car actually like to drive ? Let's go through it in its individual components , break it down and see just how good the RS5 actually well , before we even talk about what the steering is actually like .You festival have to decide which mode of steering . You wanna put the car in between comfort auto dynamic ? That's a nice touch , however , even once you've decided that I personally like it in comfort , which gives you slightly lighter our assistance . Once you've decided that I still think it is the world's most wanted , it's very accurate . Be very precise with your inputs , and you can steer it beautifully round corners . But there is no a lot of field through the rib , and that is a shame . But having said that , and M3 doesn't have a lot of fields who is really either breaks this car has optional carbon ceramic discs . Visitor on DDE in Extremist They worked beautifully this thing by 1750 kilograms , pretty much in six minutes . But again , there's a slight issue with field . I just done quite trust the field through the pedal , particularly under light loads , and it just makes it difficult to modulate smoothly when you're driving so gearbox .This is where it gets very interesting because I happen to think this thing has a it's a seven speed double clutch first time out with a proper double clutch in any all right , it works fantastically up , down you could change so fast , so smoothly . So precisely , I cannot see what you want to change .The engine . 4.2 V8 . 444 bhp And I have to say I think this is the best bit about this car . Overall , it is blinding , powerful talking . It revs toe A8 to it . Sounds nuts . Just listen to this .Wow .So the last thing to talk about guesses the chassis , obviously with four wheel drive a tractor . Incredible . Also , amazingly , for an Audi and foreign R8 Saudi in particular . This thing rise really quite well , especially you put it in comfort mode . That's a surprise . Now on the road . There's no question this thing handles really nicely . But I think to make a proper final judgment , we need to go to track . And there happens to be one of those just up the road .Well , I want about my tent flap of your scurry . So okay , here . And I have to mail . I'm having actually bought this car . I really didn't expect that the RS5 Rini handles nicely . It doesn't feel heavy as stats say , it turns in really nicely stops . Well , traction . I mean , this is a second head fire out there . That's really impressive . But way the engine gave oaks lend so nicely with with the handling and staring breaks really pulled one out the back here .Out of this . Okay , I'd say half . Maybe even a nine marks overall . It has to be tonight . This is a blinding good car . What ? Surprise ? What a car ."
186,261,RS5,"Audi has finally given us the RS5 .This is it . It looks pretty good .It's got 444 brake horsepower from a 4.2 liter V8 , so it should have some shovels . Well , so let's find out if it lives up to expectations .Entertainment .The RS5 definitely doesn't disappoint . It's got this fantastic V8 , which is a complete joy . As we know from all the other cars , handles really well .You could really lean on it through the corners . It's completely unintimidating , and it's got quite good feedback as well . I just wish it had a bit more sparkle at those speeds , and it misses some of the boys of the RS4 practicality for two door keep .I actually the A5 pretty good . You can see for people if you really want to , but they're gonna be a bit screens in the back .You can get plenty of luggage in the boot , enough for a weekend away .It's a decent driving position , and actually the car's quite refined . When you wanted to be a so top marks , really , you couldn't expect much more from this kind of car .Audi �57,480 is not cheap , but it is comparable . It's only a couple of ground more than an automatic M3 .This is only available in automatic with seven speed s tronic gearbox .It's pricey . But what did you expect ?Anyone approaching the RS5 hoping it's gonna drive like the RS4 might be a little bit disappointed , but even so , it's great fun .The ending is brilliant and we like it a lot . The 92nd verdict four stars ."
187,262,A1,"This is the new Audi A one , and it's a bit like polo fruits in the way that actually beneath the skin , it's pretty much identical to a Volkswagen Polo , which would be the plain old meant . Where's this ? Yes , it's way , way , way more fruity , therefore exciting .Obviously , they have to pay for that . It's a bit more expensive in the Volkswagen Polo . It starts 18 and 1/2 �1000 but I can see you can save almost �1000 on one through Kar wai S8 Q7 Q7 any you car click on the pop out band in the top , right hand corner of the screen . Typical .They start this review by talking about the design because I think this new a one is a really good looking car , especially in this s line dream , because you have some extra sporty bits and pieces . Also like the two tone bodywork . This blade Payne is lovely . Looks great . Good news is that when you step inside , you know , left feeling disappointed , it lives up to the exterior look , a design of the dash . It's really , really cool . I like the way this part goes away from you than this angles towards you . The shapes around the instrument been ical . That's cool as well . A lot is metallic trim here that I have noticed that there's a little chip this bit here . Well , not skittle knows this . Look scratchy plastics on the door . That was really , really budget . It's no worse than a VW Polo , but it is a bit of a shame because this is a more expensive car still in the dash . You got soft touch materials , and the best bit is that standard right across the range . You get digital instruments that looked really smart , very clear . You can change the displays , actually , to make them look more sporty or less sporty , cycle through different menus and actually change the size of the dolls on the size of the satin of mapping on there . Lovely , lovely , lovely .What's also lovely is the main central screen as well . It's quite easy to use district of the different menus like that . It doesn't click all vibrate when you press it , like in mobile phone does but responses faster . Z8 mobile phone . Now I should point out this scream . This car is a great inversion , slightly larger , and it gets Indot satellite navigation . You don't really need it because it's It's about 50 quid extra . That does include what is charging for your mobile phone . X1 mobile phone doesn't have in some of the bits and pieces . Well , I wouldn't bother with the credit system . The normal one has a decent enough screen . Or so you can just run under a daughter , apple carplay and your own mapping from your phone through the screens . He didn't really need the satnav , although you do miss out on the fact that you don't have satin of then in the instrument pinnacle . But , hey , I can live with that now you want to see what this invitation system is actually life and in depth review V8 another look around this car's coming click on the screen in Death ENTERTAINMENT VIDEO REVIEW Now moving on lat of everything in Here is dead simple . It's classic Audi , actually , so you've got your climate controls . They're very easy to use . You got some of the bones there for the drive select , which is different driving modes down here . You've got USB input there . There's USB , see if you're feeling a bit more old fashioned . This good old 12 informed .If you need to charge something like an old fashioned set , terms in the driving position is really very good . There's a lot of adjustment in the steering . We'll look at that . You conduct the driver's seat all the way up , so if you're small , you can get a good view out is enough headroom for that ? But my heart is if you're really talking , like to sit nice and low , this one just doesn't quite go low .And if it could do with dropping by an extra inch , nothing that's slightly annoying . Is this like the controller for the electric door mirrors ? It's very fiddly to get up that you need small hands like Donald Trump . Another thing that's been used when you got the gear lever there , it's hard to reach the volley control for the stereo's weren't after do bit of a reach around the North . I believe I said that Well , actually , want to use that . She didn't want to tell it the volume . If you've got the upgraded Bang and Olufsen sound system , it sounds really good . Where thing is that it comes as part of a comfort pack which also includes heated seats , parking sensors , and I wouldn't put those three together rated stereo .It is seats in park and senses , anyway , that pack costs �995 so if you want it , you're gonna want to save as much as you can on the initial purchase . Surprise . So I put this car's details into the Carlile configure Reiter .It's a one lead to 115 horsepower version of the AWOL with sport line .Automatic gearbox would only cost about 22 a half �1000 but I got enough for back saving . Just over �800 went by on PCP finance . So that pretty much pay for extra pack , won't it ?It's all about storage . Finally , So it's all right . You got a couple of cup holders here , actually lit one in the middle , which is perfect for an espresso cup in is just a space into here for your sugar for your coffee . Is that story's trade ?

If you'd like the glove box , it's in all right , so it's nothing special with the door bins are really large today . Look at that . Impressive , huh ? Right . Let's go to the back here in the back , The rear door bins really big as well . In fact , they're pretty much as big as in the front .As for passenger space . Will look vice a dead straight still go ahead room , decent me room . It's really spacious back here for a small car . People have six foot will be fine , carrying three in the back at once , though not so great if the lift the leg over that lump in the floor and then look at my head on the roof here . Three kids in the back . Oh , Bill . Right now , what they might not like so much is the fact that the window ledge is quiet height . It's harder to get a view out on here . Put the window down , you'll see . Then he goes down . This for another thing worth mentioning . You got to speak and write up there by your ear . Now that might be a good thing . If you love music , will not be a bad thing . Could end up with tinnitus .Some other things worth mentioning on the fact that Look , you've got a little coat hook there . What ? I have to demonstrate by taking my coat off really laborious and where you will click out the video . So , yeah , they're on a quite like this . You've got padded pockets in the seat back so you can slide an iPad in there . Even if you haven't got a screen protector on it won't damage . It .

So if you wanna charge people's iPads or device in the back , you putting enough to bring some those backpacks along ? There's no armrest , either . Look , no , no .

It's precise or so This is the automatic , and so changes gears for you . Say it's easier in town there . Sometimes it can be a bit clunky and jerky at lower speeds . Also , if you're just in normal Dr Mode , not sports mode for the gearbox , and you put your foot down look foot down now , taking off that delay can be a bit of a pain when you're pulling away at junctions in terms of the suspension , how deals with bumps when you have the normal car ?

Damn it . Only as a result , I don't think it's quite comfy , maybe as a Volkswagen Polo , but there's really not much in it now when you get out on the boat away , this little one feels like a bigger car , and that's because you don't get that much noise entering the cover .It's really quiet .Also .

188,263,RS6,"how much is enough and buy enough . I mean , is there a set of numbers statistics listed on a piece of paper about a car that even an ardent power freak like myself looks at and says , You know what ? That is enough . Furthermore , with specific reference to the new 572 horsepower Audi RS6 , where is the line between Enough and too much actually sit exactly why it was . But when I first saw the numbers for this new RS6 , I did finally think , You know , we've reached a point where this is too much of a state car with 572 horsepower that someone who's just live within RS4 for a year .That's a 414 horsepower estate car . I couldn't really understand why you need another 150 160 horsepower seemed potting , So yes , I thought it was too much .But especially one figure was too much . The dry weight claimed dry curb weight of this car is 2000 and 25 kilograms . That doesn't include a driver doesn't include any fluid at all , so this is really 2100 kilograms , 2.1 tons . That's less . I think that a Rolls Royce Cornish used to be . This car is hugely heavy , nearly 200 kilograms heavier than M5 touring .But we shouldn't confuse . This is just being a slightly faster S6 . S6 really isn't much fun to drive .The ride's pretty awful , and he's got no talk .Applying to turbo charges toe that engine has had quite a difference . This car has a silly amount of talk about 480 foot pounds from 1500 rpm to 6500 rpm . Talk carefully , not occur . It's just a line that you draw between two points coming out of any turn .It just goes more surprising to me . Is the transmission ? When I saw him respectfully , there was no DSG box . They just had an automatic . I thought idea , because normally Audi citron A8 gearboxes ain't much fun . It does . A good blip on downshift doesn't always get it inch perfect , but it's much better than I expected on the upshifts . Well , you barely feel that compared to the M5 SMG box , this is far more usable in everyday conditions in permanent four wheel drive and in terms of a weather everyday performance , you're RS6 is right up there with the best of it , but you can't hide . Mass Mass is always going to have an effect on a vehicle . You can throw more power at it , more talkative . You could put bigger brakes on it . You can do everything you can to make mass , go faster and stop better . But it will always come back to haunt you somewhere . And it's here in the RS6 . It may have excellent brakes , and it may go like a lunatic , But is there the whole time in the direction changes in the inertia ? It just feels like a big , heavy car .It's nearly 400 kilograms more than RS4 of that . And yes , it does feel it .So this is what the new RS6 owner has to do to reach 60 miles an hour . Gets in shut store seatbelt on turns , key rows is engine selects sport . It's on 60 miles an hour . That's quite impressive .Audi still talks about 40 60 split front rear on A4 drive system , but it just feels from little driven to Mei . We've been coming out of every term . We could in second gear , flat to the boards , and there is not a whiff of oversteer , okay ? And he's slightly deranged . Magazine will , where you want to get big drift shots . That does matter . But in the real world , that doesn't matter at all . It just means that every time you M5 drivers scared shitless coming out of second gear turned the RS6 driver just barrel straight on got a three mo damper in this car in comfort mode . Pretty good doesn't really like low speed , choppy stuff . And I wouldn't bother with sport mode because that appears to just take the dampers out altogether and leave you with a lot of rock in the suspension instead .First , when I saw the RS6 didn't have a DSG gearbox , I thought , Come on , lads , When are we going to get in RS6 Audi with this fantastic the street double clutch gearbox . But it doesn't matter with this car . The transmission in this perfectly suits the role of the RS6 as an everyday super estate car . It's incredibly easy to use at low speed , which is crucial because the M5 turning we have here is well , it's a total pig at low speed , and yet when you do flat upshifts , you get this wonderful part part part noise . Get this .That's the sound of a recently spanked RS6 one crib sheet full of numbers , one helpfully open bonnet on a new RS6 . Right ? How we looking here ? V 10 5 liters 500E 72 horsepower . Wait for it . 479 foot pounds of torque from 1500 rpm to 6 to 50 . That's crazy , I said . Six and 1/2 . It was wrong effectively . A D tuned gay Ardo engine from Lamborghini with two turbo chargers on it . How do they make it fit ? How much heat builds up in his engine ? The great unknowns . Where does it sit relative to the front axle ? I will now indicate with my arm where the front actual Linus that so the whole engine block sits in front of the actual line . So this is very much an old school . Audi A4 . Dr . Transmissions , we said , can split up to 60% backwards . 40% forwards . That's the most real would travel you're going to get from this set up that shot this kind Audi grills get any bigger .We ask ourselves from me , not they'll take up half the bonnet next month Okay , Some other numbers .2025 kilograms , As we said , Dry about 2100 kilograms , with one person in the car driving along with some fuel in and fluids . That's big , big heavy car RS4 steering wheel with RS6 written on it .That's a bit different that bit there . What else have we got ?Lots of sort of piano effect Would .We've got some slightly special sleeps with RS6 written on them , but otherwise pretty much stock A6 slightly funky dials .Not much just then again , if you got a cap in this good to start with , who cares about it not being two different ? Certainly not me from the outside . Well , well , from the outside , I know . Look several subjective . I personally don't think it has quite the presence of the RS4 . Maybe a sedative in the way that the wheel arches aren't quite as well filled by these wheels .Needs a twenties there , optional .The biggest one you could get for the car , but it doesn't have that sort of hunkered down . Come on , I'll bash you off the road . Look that the RS4 has .The arches are supposed to hark back to that great old chestnut , the Quattro , the car that Audi still cops on about . We did love it very much , though , and they've got these sort of solid tops to them and they come out the way the Quattro watches did , and they're listed on the front in the rear . But no , they're very , very subtle . I think you'd need to pump this next to a normal A6 event to really appreciate just how much more butch this one is .Front brakes are standard with 19 inch wheels are 390 million . The front spring to 56 of the back . Dirty , great Big Six piston caliper . Look at that . You even get that ponsi RS6 in Britain , however optional . If you go for the 20 inch wheels are ceramics . Listen to the size of these 420 millimeters 300D six minute the back that is huge . They do save 12.2 kilos from the answering most of the cargo , and I suspect that will help the ride as well .Option price . Well , on my RS4 think there were three or �4000 . They've got a �77,000 car and you put ceramics on it and a few other toys . You could easily have an 83 �84,000 RS6 that's becoming a very expensive car .So is it enough , or is it too much difficult ? Want to call this ? But the answer . I wanted to really dislike this car because I do think it's numbers are obscene , and I don't see why any estate car a bit one with 570 horsepower should weigh 2.1 tons . In this day and age , we've been making cars lighter . We need to be reducing emissions , and it just seems a bit obscene . Of course , when you spend a day with a car like the RS6 , those feelings melt somewhat because he needs a very , very capable package . Somehow , it isn't the most impressive of the three Rs Protect tried . Now both the RS4 on the R8 are better showcase of four Quatro G . M B H could do with BAE Saudis , but I'm still more impressed by the RS6 than I thought I would be cross country .It puts all that power down in the UK it'll be unstoppable . Come rain or China will be the fastest , very biggest a car ever made any 63 went See which where it went .Neither , sadly , will the vehicle in the background the M5 touring ? And that's a great car . It's hilarious . It's a hot rod , but it's SMG . Transmission is rudely exposed by the gearbox in this RS6 . And even though it will do massive skids , I have to say that of the two they are a stick is the better car in the knowledge that jag you A will soon be owned by Indian company That makes an off roader called the Gurkha . Would you buy one of those instead of A5 Siri's BMW ?"
189,264,Q5,"don't be fooled by the familiar styling . This Audi Q5 is alone new . It's a second generation car , and it follows on from the first , which found 1.6 million homes around the world since it went on sale in 2008 . Now this new one pixel , the usual new car boxes are being lighter . It's more efficient having a plush new in Syria . It's also built in Mexico , which is where we've come to test it .For the first time in the UK , we're gonna get two litre diesel engine on a two litre , forcing the petrol engine and it really to be six diesel . Some cars around the world will get from Will drive . A manual gearbox has been in the UK They are torturing a wheel drive on automatic only now the V six diesel is a permanent cuatro oil drive . On has an eight speed talking murder automatic connected to the engineers . Lots of talk , some 620 Newton meters , and it's an incredibly smooth and refined engine . In fact , that's pretty .They're one of the high points of the Q5 asshole . Just how relaxed quiet is to drive .We've also had to go in the two litre , four cylinder petrol model . That was a very nice engine as well . You have to rev it . Thio get the power . But once you're there , it's willing to be repped as well . There's a nice spread of talk on . That's probably all the G5 most people are gonna need .Audi Office , several different suspension settings on the Q5 . We're trying cars here in Mexico with the air springs and adaptive dampers on the roids . Comfort is excellent . It's a very comfortable car on . You can play around with all the different settings there . Seven in total , on 60 millimeters off adjustability In the suspension , the highest reserved for off road on . We had a bit of off road driving on their The G5 did all it needed to . Audi sells this car around the world on or in many of the markets Russia , Eastern Europe , parts of the Americas , those of the sort of gravel tracks there .By his encounter on DDE , it was performed well .Steering is electric steering . There is a variable ratio , one coming that was the normal one . For now , it's not the most communicative steering It doesn't you wanted Teoh that would really wants a more feeling The interaction from that handling is not vehicle involving .It's not a fun car , but it is a very safe , competent car .This talk vectoring is standard , which keeps the nose top 10 going round corners on . It's pretty resistant to understand as well . In time , the V six diesel will be offered with a sports differential on . Now the engineers claim that with this , you might even be able to get the car to overstate .Now . One of the really high points of this Q5 is the interior . It's largely borrowed from the A4 A5 Q7 models on . It's simply off quality none of the rivals could match .There is the Audi virtual cockpit . Q5 also gets out these latest and then my entertainment screen . That's not touch screen , which I personally prefer find touch screens , not the safest things . You have to take your eyes off the road constantly and povero of your finger . Instead , you get a combination of a rotary will on a little touch pad on Dhe . Simply put , is one of the best systems out styling Waas .You'll be hard pressed to pick this G5 out in the old one . But success off the old G5 men that Audi is good formula . It's pretty successful on it . Doesn't wantto do anything drastically different . Alienate such a large audience Now , would you buy an Audi keep ?Well , for most people , they probably would . They're gonna like the way it looks quiet .Smith is economical way a bit more , handling a bit more involvement in the way drives like to Jackie Wreck place in court can have shown that can be done , which for us means that it doesn't go to the top of the class ."
190,266,A8,"welcome to the third generation A8 account , Audi says now has the capability and technology to lift it from being a bit player in executive car market to become a serious , credible alternative to the Mercedes S Class and BMW seven Siri entertainment .Now you might not expect much from Big D's a saloon , but this has to be one 60 miles an hour in five seconds flat .However , despite all that performance on an abundance of grip isn't is engaging to drive show us new exchange practicality .No issues with the front of the cabin . But the rear is just too cramped for this class of car on dhe boots , barely larger than that of an Audi A4 .Funny for money at the 4.2 liter TV and eighties more expensive in the six cylinder s class , but it does come with a considerable performance advantage . The thing to watch , though the options prices because they could easily turn a �60,000 car into what we're sitting in today , which is an �80,000 .Unlike in previous generations , that's now so much more to the A8 in the way it looks .It's now fast , well built a packed with useful technology are major cripple . The fact that in this show , well based version , the packaging isn't so clever . Overall , then a flawed but very welcome addition to the Class of 92nd verdict four stars ."
191,267,Q3,"Audi just launched this . The Q3 , a compact , premium off roader designed to do battle with the BMW X1 on the brand new Range Rover , evoke in costume from �24,000 .Question is exactly how much SUV is that Money , by entertaining way haven't come to expect great things from Audi four by fours in this department . But Q3 is different in comfort . Motorcar has a nice ride and handling compromise . It steers well to DSG gearbox and Quattro Drive train about smooth , well mannered and responsive practicality .Is the Q3 big enough for every occasion ? The answer's yes , with a couple of caveats . As you can see up front , there's plenty of room in the back seats . It's a little bit more confined on the boot isn't massive .Given this is sort of SUV , you might run as a second car . It's probably just about big enough value for money .Entry level 138 horsepower front wheel drive Q3 will cost you less than an entry level BMW X1 considerably less than a Range Rover . But whichever model you up for running costs should be among the best in class .Audi Q3 is clearly a very refined , well rounded and desirable family car , albeit one with limited practicality . It remains to be seen how well the car ride and handling the UK , but for now , the 92nd verdict is four stars ."
192,268,A6,"This is what we know already . The A6 Saloon is far and away the best executive Audi we have seen in a number of years , but we know also that it's a state cast have often lagged behind that level . So what we're here to find out today is whether this new , good looking A6 event is finally the car that can offer credible opposition to the class on the Mercedes E class estate , in particular living with it .Well , this is where the A6 event really excels . At last you got Audi was really does ride as well as the BMW or Mercedes . Fine Mint is exceptional , lots of room in the back .But it's the interior ambience , the way that driving environment is laid out , what really sets this car apart ?If I The only thing that we would warning about is playing a bit too fast and loose with the options . This is a car with the basic . This price of nearly �41,000 already have put some goodies on this one , and it comes out of somewhere nearer �79,000 .So shop with care is the A6 event of the car to make e class devoted desert their beloved estates ? Clearly not . But is it a likable , capable , competent new arrival in the class ? Absolutely . And it's a long time since we've been able to say that about an A6 estate . The Auto Car 92nd verdict . Three and 1/2 styles ."
193,269,RS4,"if you could only ever have one car and you just so happen to have over �60,000 . Bear , would you choose this ? The Audi or S4 ?It's fast . It's practical .I was just having a sneaky kid on dit looks rate .It's really good for Instagram This so yeah , What ?Post that now If you wanna fly in scrum fade , it's called loud calls , right ?First thing you need to know about the new or S4 is what's under the bonnet as it's slightly controversial . You see , the old RS4 had a 4.2 liter naturally aspirated V8 in love to read , and it sounded amazing . This is a 2.9 liter V six . Still , it does have to turbo charges . So it has the same fortune 50 horsepower as the old V8 engine . But talk is actually up from Fortune 30 Newton meters to 600 . This added pulling power helps get the north S60 time from 4.7 to just 4.1 seconds . Fingers . I actually think it will go even faster than that . So I'm gonna find out . I've got my special timing gear up here . I'm gonna put in launch mode on . Just launch it . We shall see .Yes . Oh , that's 16 way back . They're gonna keep on going . That's enough . No , it's a six day , 3.5 seconds all day . Actually , Audi is known toe often understate the performance figures off its R S cars , and this includes the power their engines puts out . In fact , when I tested this RS4 on the dyno , it was producing 16 horsepower more than it was supposed to . And that brings me on to five other things which are impressive about this car . The Quattro Permanent all wheel drive system sends 40% of the power to the front and 60 to the rear , so it is rear drive biased . Also in the UK , you get a rare sport differential standard and that consent power to outside . Will you turn around a corner , help push you around ?The car gets a bit spoke . Our Estyle big central rev counter with Speedo incorporated in the middle of it . You can also see the power and torque output from the engine , or , if you want to , you can choose to see a gene later .The optional adaptive suspension has a very clever feature so if you're going round a corner fast that way , the car will lead that way . Said to stop that happening and make it Koris flat as possible . Well , actually proper the outside wheels to keep it nice and flat . Also , if you're breaking will stop the card diving on when you're accelerating will stop it .Pitching the option of sports exhaust has two modes , so this is the normal quiet mode .Sounds all right . But if you were into sports mode that was evolved just opening notice , it's got bit louder then . If you're ever it sounds like this , that's much better off .This new RS4 is actually 80 kilos lighter than the old one , and 30 kilograms of that is down to the engine alone , though it still weighs around 1800 kilos .Still , it looks pretty . Sleep on . The orris has some key styling upgrades over the normal A4 advance . Yet a honey comb grill RS4 budging bigger from bumpers with larger , more aggressive Aaron takes . There's a little air breathers there as well to help s move over the wheel .Speaking of which , they're 19 inches standard . The's a twenties have also got some RS performance breaks , the core is lower .You got side skirts , but my favorite bit is this . Look at this . The real horses just stick out . Looks really muscular . Reminds me of a Group B Audi rally car out the back door roof spoiler that's amore or is budging over there deeper rear bumper as well . And of course , it's a big oval classic RS6 our tailpipes . Now click on the pop out banner in the top right hand corner of the screen to let me know which you prefer . Audi RS4 Mercedes-Benz 63 AMG Estate BMW M3 Orale from A8 Julia Quadra Folio Let me know what you think . In fact , when you fight it out in the comments box below God found boys , take it away Inside , though the enhancements aren't quite as noticeable . Dion trade I It's just been a fall that is no bad thing there because this is a lovely interior anyway . But if you look closely , you will notice a few R s upgrade such as the steering wheel which has a flat bottom . You gone or is better known as well . I'm always batting down here by the gear selector .You've also got aluminium pedals and , of course , the lovely or s quilted sport seats . And they did this thing where they pump with side bolsters . When you turn the car into hold you tightly in place there .To be fair , you ought to get these seats in the lesser S4 I've been using this . RS4 is my daily driver for the past two months , and you're probably wondering what kind of economy it's being getting . Seeing as the reason Audi switched to a smaller engine is for improved efficiency . It supposed to do 32 miles per gallon , though I'm only averaging 25 .There are some of the things which aren't so great about this car S5 what some of the vents on this car or really others are fake as a little straight now with the car wire sticker treat . Look , they don't go anywhere . And neither does that . In fact , I've broken the pour column or a stick of truth .A8 speed automatic gearbox is pretty good in auto mode . You may wanna put into manual mode to control the call yourself a bit more involvement .The only problem is , is that the paddles used to control it just feel absolutely cheap and horrible to touch . I hope you like the RS4 in this nado gray because it's a bit of a shame if you don't as it's the only color that comes free or the other colors are cost options , these Lena silver seat look great . The only problem is , is that they pick up the delight and dirt from the genes very easy , so they're always needing a jolly good clean look at the difference that made the button to change cars .Driving modes is all the way down here , which is pretty hard to reach . When you're driving , you're headed . However , you can actually assign the driving modes to this particular button on the steering wheel . Any problem is , then , that you can't use that particular button for anything else .What I can't complain about , though , is how the RS4 drives . Well , seeing as this is a performance car , it makes perfect sense to talk about the comfort . First . They're seriously it does because you see this car got here is fitted with the adaptive suspension , and he has a comfort mode . When you're in that mode , you'd be amazed how well this thing deals with bumps it's really quite comfortable , Even though this one's riding on 20 inch alloy wheels , you deliver this every day . No problem . It's all really , really easy to live with . But then you press this button down here and put it into dynamic mode , and then you get more weighted steering , get more noise from the exhaust on the suspension , stiffens up , and then , yes , it turns into a based to get over 100 lives .You have to be careful with this car on the road because you flex your right foot and you are breaking the speed limit and you control it as well .Obviously you got quadruple will drive . It gives you lots of grips or whatever the weather . You could drive this thing fast . It also handles Well . You said before was Audi is evolved . Just felt a bit , wouldn't you ? Couldn't read told was going on beneath me . But this one it's fine , it really is . You can feel it moving the band when you took it into a corner . That makes it more fun . Admittedly , it's not quite finished like a Mercedes C 63 or a BMW M3 . Those area will drive well . They're just a little bit more flight . He put your foot down in one of those . It's been done , but they want to go sideways . This just rips on goes also , I think that BMW and the Mercedes have a bit more front and biters watching . When you turn them into a corner , they just start in the nose digs and they just turn this one not so much . But once you get into a rhythm with it , yeah , it is good fun . It really is . Only only complaint really has to be the fact that the suspension settings aren't quite right for the UK , so Comfort's great when you're cruising around , but it's just a little bit too soft . Really . Thrashing the cars in the corner does lean a bit too much . And then when you put in the dynamic mode to make it better , it's nice and flat in the corners . Bart , the problem is , is then just a little bit too bouncy over bumps . There is another mode called Auto , whether Costas is it out . But that still doesn't quite cut the mustard . Really . What we need is another mode called British , which is perfect for our roads F40 though the Germans , they're never gonna do that . Still , overall , this is a great around real world supercar . I love it .So then my verdict on the Audi RS4 . Well , I'll admit it won't be for everybody . For instance , if you like doing track days or power slides , then it might not be the right car for you .But if you're a normal person , he just wants another looks good , is comfortable , is easy to live with , is practical and is genuinely good fun to drive on completely bonkers .Fast .Then this Audi RS4 is awesome . In fact , I think it's the best Oreste car Audi has ever made . Enjoy this video .

194,270,A4,"the new Audi A4 . Well , that's the thing is the new Audi A4 .We have to check the number plate to be sure , because to be fair , the design hasn't changed all that much in 12 years . For instance , right here is this car there , right ? That's the one before it . And that's the one before it . A ll very similar . And yeah , that's me after a heavy night out for that because on the inside , the design is quite different in the old car , so well , it's lovely in here . Actually , the design is very simple . Everything's easy to use on the quality . It's exemplary .Now you gotta be careful , though None of the cars in the range come with full leather seats , a standard which is a little bit bizarre on a car in this class Have they all do come with Bluetooth .They come with digital radio , you get parking senses , xenon headlamps .So if you're gonna want to step up to the sport model because then you get sat enough and it's a really good system .I love Audi is user interface with the entertainment system , and he can watch our full review of it by clicking in the top right hand corner on the card to see a detailed review on the front of the look around this cabin on G20 noticed this one's actually got the wide screen display , which is lovely .I've also got what Audi calls their virtual cockpit , so no analog dials . It's all digital , and you can change the view through two different modes and even have a full beautiful widescreen setting up there , right in your eye line . Another thing that Audi is done is try to improve the practicality site . The door bins will take a 1.5 liter bottle of water on DDE . They also will hear in the back , which is quite unusual nowadays .Actually increased the size of the A4 ever so slightly over the old one , and the numbers are in that huge . But you do feel the difference . For instance , I M5 for 11 ish on dhe . Well , I've got lots of knee room , plenty of head room . Someone over six foot will be absolutely fine here in the back . It's a little bit wider than before , so it's less of a squeeze for three people on . You can see exactly what I'm only trying to fit three people in the back of this car by clicking in the top right hand corner of the screen on the card . But overall , I'll say that this is the most practical car in the back than all its rivals , and that brings us on to the boot .Now , in terms of the actual boot volume , well , the capacity is pretty much identical to the Mercedes C class on BMW three serious . But the Audi just seems to make better use of its available space , so the boot is nice and square , so you can really pack it full of stuff . There's a low load lift on a low load high , plus the happenings nice and white . It's It's not too difficult , too blowed . Unload it . And it's a nice features as well , such as these curry hawks and tethering points . And on the whole lot in the A4 is the most practical car in its class .Audi also comes with three way folding rear seats , a standard , and that brings us on to the five other core things about this car .The Audi A4 is the most aerodynamic car in its class , with the drag coefficient of just 0.23 of a CD . Which case you were wondering is that much ?The car uses high speed in video chip so that you can actually use Google Earth by the Internet . Nothing .Agony . The side mirrors from there to the top of the doors to reduce wind whistles .This huge event emits a soft breeze , which I would like to call it a shower .The car is up to 21% more efficient on 120 kilograms lighter than its predecessor but still cold bench president . However , while there is blended to like about the A4 , there are a few things which aren't so cool .They're going box is a little bit small that you can't carry a pack of standardized paper .Yes , training automatic gearbox can be a little bit jerky at slow speeds .Lumber support doesn't come a standard on the bottom to trim levels .The sport . Nobody can be a little bit really depressed when you're driving .A4 is a little bit boring , so perfect for accountants . Maybe that's why I like it . But what ? I like it just as much when I hit the road .Now we all know that front wheel drive Audi A4 is never gonna be as much fun to drive as a rare Dr BMW three . Serious . But how often do you get to fully exploit your car's handling Everyday motoring ?This thing is almost perfect on It's just so supremely quiet .It's also , well , so long as you avoid the sport suspension Very , very comfortable , especially on the adaptive dampers thing . Isn't devore to fun anyway , It's actually all right , handles very well , and it's only really when you chuck it into a very tight corner and then try and floor the thrall as you exit the front tires . Go what ? You want me to accelerate and stare at the same time ? Are you completely mad anyway ? That's your thing when you just get one of the grip here or we'll drive cuatro models over all this Audi A4 . He's just so easy and relaxing to drive on . Audi just manages to judge the way of all the controls perfectly to the steering , the brakes , the dish if they just feel nice to use , and it's quite an easy car to drive in town as well , because the visibility is very good .There's no obvious blind spots to get in your way , and you can see for yourself by clicking on the top right hand corner of the screen on the card in terms of engines .Well , all about his engines . A really impressive I'm gonna keep it nice and simple for you . If you don't do that many miles , get the 1.4 liter turbo petrol . If you do lots of miles , get the two litre diesel in 190 horsepower guys , which is what this car has . The reason is that it's nice and sporty feels pretty quick on DDE . It actually gives really good economy . So Audi says it'll do 67 miles per gallon on in my hands . It's doing almost 54 actually .All right , but my hands okay , and over what I think of the idea for Well , the design is a little bit bland on .The options are quite expensive , but it's a really relaxing Carter .Dr Andi , it's practical .Typically get there on the top right corner of the screen .

195,271,A5,"This is the new Audi A5 , and it's essentially on A4 only in a slightly snazzier jacket to help make it stand out on become more appealing . Audi has also fitted it with stiffer suspension , which is a bit like swapping your sensible shoes for a pair off trainers that makes it feel more sporty .Now there is a price to pay for these changes . You see the A5 costs on average around �2000 in the equipment A4 , and it starts from just under 3 �1000 . But if you could get there to get a car by dot co dot uk , you can compare office from dealers and by price , your confidence in . I don't have rich people say , �3600 on a new car through Kara .Why not on the inside ? It's identical to the A4 , but that's no bad thing because the design is really nice . Clean on Simple , maybe doesn't feel quite as flashy as a Mercedes C Class coupe A8 , but the quality is actually better than all the materials . They're lovely , they're robust . It feels very well screwed together .Like some of the features as well . For instance , this car has the the temperature settings for the comet control . Actually , within the dolls . It's really , really smart guys . Then there's entertainment system so standard the car gets a seven inch screen . But this one has the grading system out .My gosh , it's really slick . Very fast to use , very intuitive . It's It's one of the very best in protective systems you can buy , all so you can get it with apple carplay on dhe Android auto . And if you click it , they can watch my fault indeed , video review of it .Now this particular car is fitted with Audi Virtual cockpit .So instead of normal traditional dollars , I've got full digital display for the driver , and I conflict between different screens very easily without taking my eyes off the road . And look at that . I can change the view so I can either have big dials or a huge , nah V map . I mean , that's great .So , too , is the fact that you've got large door bins , which is big enough to hold a 1/2 a bottle of water . Which brings us on to practicality because after all , this is a kook .Peso practicalities impaired somewhat to get into the back . I just help you out by having a seat which will slide forward automatically and then return to original position . Just move this one out of the way as well , so you can see what the heck's going on back here . So pull the seat back into our position . Now Audi has made this A5 sorry Long room wide and taller than the old one , and as a result , there is more room in the back , though there's still not a great deal . So look , I'm sitting up . My head is wedged against the roof . Now Nearing is okay ish . I can slouch a bit , but still taller . People won't like it much in the back of this car . I also find it little bit cramped in the fort area are on the whole . I think they're basically four series is more comfortable for carrying rear passengers , but it's not all bad , so there are few useful practical features in the back of this car .So go cup holder there . Your story's been there . Here . This is quite handy , actually , because I've had enough awareness . It's a little bit too tight on me . I think I bought it , drawing a thinner period . I hope they're working , hanging on , which is handy . So , too , is the fact that you can get in the car with not only enormous and a special could be there . But this receipt split three ways , so you can co two people on skis and then you control the chairs down if you want . And if you notice as well , the actual gap through into the back there is nice and wide right , that brings us on to the boot .So much air out of the way into steak , it's telling .This A5 actually has the largest boot in its class is actually not that much smaller than the A4 on the openings . Really ? Bigas . Well , the lower lip isn't too high . It's a really useful square shape . You've got some cubbies hair and here tethering points . You can lower the seats from here if you want it . You got curry hook to hang your shopping off . There . On under Here is a space saver spare wheel . Now , if you'll see just how much stuff you can fit in this car's boot , click it there to watch detail , practicality , video .You're about to see what it's like with two people in the back of the car on just how easy it is to fit a child seat .Let's be honest . No , copays aren't about practicality . They drive is important . Like I said , it's beginning this video . The A5 is essentially an A4 in a different outfit on , and it has slightly stiffer suspension , and it makes it feel more sporty and also makes it feel a little bit more uncomfortable over bums . Now you can get this car with three different settings . Normal suspension or sport suspension , which is low in Stepford . Still on make the car more bouncy , or the best bear is the optional adaptive dampers , which have a comfort mo for cruising about Onda sports mode , which stiffens things up when you want to throw the car down a twisty road , and it's leading so much in the corners . This car is front wheel drive , whereas something like a bearded Z4 series or Mercedes C class on normally really drive . Now , put this into perspective for you . A Volkswagen Polo is front wheel drive . A Formula One car is really wheel drive , so yeah , enough said . Really , now you can Of course , get this idea with cultural will drive , and that gives you more grip . But it does make it handle slightly better , but still , overall , I don't think this A5 is as much fun to drive as its German rivals . It's all right , Audi . It's just no . One thing I can't complain about . This car , though , is just how easy it is to drive and to live with .So all the controls that nicely weighted on visibility actually is pretty good for a Cupertino the back window . I could see quite a lot , which is unusual for this kind of car . And if you click it there to join me for 360 degree passenger right video , you can see for yourself if I was also very quite common trumping on even its speed .And then there's its engines , which are among the best in the business on dhe . If I buy , this guy will probably go for the two litre turbo petrol because it gives a reasonable economy and it feels nice and fast in reverie . Another good choice , if you want performance and economy is one of the V six days ALS . Most people , though , will go for the engine in this car . It's the two litre diesel with 100 90 horsepower on . Yeah , it's fairly flexible .It's nice and quiet on .DIT gives a pretty good account of itself . Now it's impossible to do 64 mpg , and if I look down but the trick computer , it says I'm doing 150 which is actually not bad at all . Also , this engine can get from north 62 miles an hour in just 7.7 seconds if you go for the excellent seven speed S tronic automatic gearbox , and that's because it has a launch control function , something engaging now . To do that , I put the car into SP sport mode . The drive selected a dynamic the gearbox into the sport setting . Hold on the break for the thrall , release the brake well spent because it is a very slippery service that would have affected the time . But we are now doing 60 on break so I don't go off the end of the truck , get the house lights to warn people that I worked very hard . Okay , let's see how fast that waas a little bit off the manufacturer's time . But he would not closer . If you did that , all will drive grip anyway .Let's move on to five anoint things about this new Audi A5 .This particular car costs �43,000 .Do you think that it would have wing mirrors that folding automatically when you lock the car ? Right now , you have to do your bloody self .The hardware for the entertainment system A8 into the glove box space , which means that while you can for the manual in there , there's not really much really anything else .This new idea A5 looks rather like the old Audi A5 , so your neighbors may not be able to tell you've actually got brand new car .The entry level car doesn't get satellite navigation nor lumber support , a standard which is a bit mean concerning the price of this car .Don't buy the optional variable rate steering because it just feels weirdly assisted .Go However , it's Noel bad . This painting , like about the new A5 , such as these following features . This new A5 is up to 60 kilograms lighter than the old A5 for improved efficiency . Better road holding on to make it easier to push at the way .When he closed the door . A little seat belt . Butler Andi a belt V8 .According to Audi , the A5 is the most aerodynamic car in its class . It's A5 .Standard safety features include auto emergency braking on a public bonnet .

Is using a mobile phone app just being able to unlock it or lock it remotely .If you click it , they get more information and save an average of �2500 on a new A5 , a car with a co dot uk .So what's my overall verdict on this car ? Should do . Avoid it should consider it should have short list there . Or should we just go right ahead and buy it ? Well , I reckon you should short list the new Audi A5 .

196,272,RS3,"This is the new Audi RS tree on , but you won't know how it compares to the Mercedes AMG a 45 while I'm gonna find out later in this video . But first I'm gonna give this car a jolly good testing because apparently Audi says it's a lot more fun than the old or X3 . But I'll be the judge of that . With that in mind , let's kick off the car A5 cool things about this German uber hatchback .The highlight of this car has to be . It's rather lovely . 2.5 later anyway . 2.5 litre A5 Stender Turbocharged , rented . It has 400 horsepower , which is pretty much twice that of the original . Quattro also has , fortunately enemies of talk . Anything it for North . 60 in 4.1 seconds . That's warm . Striking figures . Waiter , good engine .Just cut .This are X3 gets the special RS4 tile . Look at that with a big rev counter with speed or in the middle . And then you could get other displays as well , such as less G meter on DDE power and talk .In the end , It , unlike the Mercedes AMG , a 45 on the BMW M two , you can get the or X3 with carbon ceramics from breaks , which is greatly gone . Track a lot because they don't pay as much as normal breaks .Everything is costing more than 40,000 times .Ideas made the history as light as possible , and as a result , it's got the highest patter weight ratio in its class . So better rated BMW two on the Mercedes AMG A 45 .Don't know what that number is . 265 horsepower per ton now , probably his weights .Measures include aluminium body , it would say A7 kilos washed up on the A3 .Also , the engine in this car is 26 kilos lighter in the engine .In the old artistry , when you add up all these weight savings , you get to around 80 kilos less in the Old West , which is about the same way as me . So you are a street that's the way to the old or a street .This influx in the exhaust which remain closed just cruising along . So the cars and two noise on the motorway . But they opened up when you put your foot down . Six . Nice and loud , and if you want it to be even louder . You can upgrade to the sports exhaust , which sounds like this .However , not everything about the artistry is great . His A5 annoying things bad .Normal Audi A3 starts Moran �20,000 but the artistry is �45,000 which is quite a lot for a hatchback . This particular car with options is actually six grand . In fact , if you speak up a noise through as much as you can , looking around �65,000 maybe click it there you got a car . Wow dot co dot uk . Build your ideal car online . Then within 24 hours , you'll get five great office back from Top Data's . They're gonna do that on any call for that matter .Unlike the BMW em to , you can get the Audi or X3 with a manual gearbox . It's a seven speed auto only on the auto community jerky .Relieving the most be having night blooming brilliant boot is 10% smaller than on the normal A3 . That's it . I definitely don't want Jake .There are seats . Don't quite go low enough for a sporty car on the side . Baltar's that We hold that firmly in place when you get in the corner . You always feel like you're gonna fall out of them . Oh , no , I've fallen . I'd like to get my old bike .This car's top speed is electrically limited to 155 miles an hour . It is actually capable of 174 miles an hour .But if you want to unlock the 174 miles an hour , you have to pay Audi an extra �1600 . Dirty , thieving .Thankfully , you won't feel short changed with the rest of the Rs three experience . Being based on A3 means there's painted room for passengers .Also , interior quality is impressive on being the RS6 sporting operates , but way more visual upgrades on the outside . I'm gonna talk around the design of this new RX350 int to the normal A3 . And I'm gonna start at the back because this is the view you're most likely to see because usually this car will be ahead of you . So you've got a big rear bumper . It's got a diffuser integrated into it on . You've got oval tailpipes . One meets side .Of course , round the side , you get some 19 inch alloy wheels .A standard almost forgot . Actually , also got a spoiler there , rather discreet . That's almost forgot it for a hot hatch . It's not too in your face , really . You got some side skirts , the car is lowered over the normal A3 on that improves the handling , but it also makes it look meaner , as do the wider wheel arches . You come around to the front , you get led . Headlamps are standard R8 badging here at the front , and you got Norris style when he came grill on down . You got a deeper from bumper here on cuatro badging to remind you that this car has Quattro or will drive , and I like the fact this is in like a battleship . Gray color looks sort of mean , no , quite mean , though I don't think as the Mercedes-Benz G a 45 but what do you think that his and pictures of the Mercedes just to remind you Now what I want to do is click up there on vote and let me know what you think looks the best . The Audi well , the Mercedes .What's more important , though , is how the artistry and a 45 compare from behind the wheel . First up Audi , now one of The good things about the alr X3 is that you can drive it around every day , and it's perfectly comfortable and easy to live with . This is the standard suspension . It doesn't feel too fun , even though riding on massive alloy wheels . If you get the adaptive suspension , it's even more comfortable . It really is a nicely rounded car . Now . A lot of people think that liken Audi or X3 is gonna be a little bit boring , but it can actually be fuck then you could imagine Turn off the stability control in this thing on . It will be a little bit playful , especially in the wet . It's gonna be harder to get it moving around in the dry 1st 1 of the benefits of portraying Let's enjoy the car fully , even when it's peeing down with rain .I'm glad that Audi let you turn the stability control away . Often the off is indeed off X1 . Well , you kinda a little bit of sliding around if you will hunt .One thing that does surprise me about this car is the engine , so I mean it is It's lovely , but I think it sounds a little bit better on the outside but on the inside , those outside the car really get to appreciate A5 warble . I love I love noises , car mates .See how easy it is to race ? Start on Rs three . So you put up with the lights left on the break for the throne release Go S60 dead . That's 80 . That's 102 100 .It's that easy When I mention the Audi , it did naught to 60 miles an hour in just 3.7 seconds . But how would you say it costs from �42,000 on has a two litre , four cylinder turbo engine with 381 horsepower on dhe , 475 Newton meters , Paris in tow or four wheels through a seven speed . You'll put automatic gearbox . Say , Let's see how it launches now after those poor both bubbles up from the start .It's fast , very fast as well . That's 60 . That's A8 .There's the 100 miles an hour in the Mercedes I didn't know to 60 miles an hour in four seconds dead . Know that ?How is the rest of the driving experience jump into the A4 G5 away ? There was a bit more like a racing car . I don't know when that's because you're sat lower in it . So you bums close to the road , staring just a little bit more weight to it .And then there's the designers . Well , the designs just a bit more sporty with these big dials .It doesn't seem saying Levering quite as much as the other day . A bit more nuts . It just doesn't communicate with you as well .T this chassis just doesn't know . Not for May not for Mei is an average driver , which I'm sure most of you are as well . The Audi is the more phone call . Okay , wait a minute . Ill Audi or S is more fun than the equivalent Mercedes A vj I've never said that before in my entire life .All right , But I must say I'm quite surprised with this new RS6 300D GT-R Maur than the old car .You know , it's got a brilliant engine .The shacks is actually pretty good as well . It moves around , It's playful . I'm surprised by that . And of course it's dead . Easy to live with .Every day is a comfortable , easy car to drive .What's not to like ? I really do like the Mercedes AMG A4 G5 It's just more of a one trick pony . If you go on lots of track days , you'd love it . It feels shop . It's a bit like a racing car , Maur .

198,274,Q8,"This is a new Audi Q5 A8 , and it's got one of the biggest matters of any car on sale . I mean , basically , what is done is taken its normal grill and then fitted it with what seems like a dentist . My face is that it's gonna hates losing teeth . Audi Now Audi , in its wisdom , has coming being too blue by creating on SUV Cooper . So this is out his version of the BMW X6 .And these SUV coup pays a little bit more expensive than the SUV's , in which their base of this is based on the Q7 . So , for instance , it starts from �65,000 if you got a car so you can save an average of �3000 or these Q A8 . Now , if you're thinking about buying one of these or any new car for that matter , click on the pop out right in the top right corner . The screen S7 .You can save on new car a car like I just said , The Q A8 is based on the Q7 . But unlike that , kites knocking seven seats , it's a five seat are only , but it's a brilliant five seater .For starters , it's dead easy to get in because you've got these huge rear doors that doesn't make them a bit harder to open in tight spaces anymore . Banging the cause bad , but makes it dead easy .Like I said , to get in and out . Look , there's loads of room on the seat is just the perfect height . Futures sit on two . So it shouldn't be too hard for Ld relatives or kids to get into the back like in some tall S E v E's . Now for just shuffle across , I can show you how much room I've got here . So headroom , That's all right . Look at that Knee room is amazing on because the front seats are quite razor . You can really stretch , and it's just like being in limousine . It's incredible . Now I can recline the seats to make it's comfortable as possible . And for a �350 extra , you can have them sliding so you can increase the boot space . And even with him in the most forward position , look , I've got about as much knee room , then as in an Audi A3 . So that's all good . Other things to note are that you've got three seats across the back here . This middle one is a bit narrower , but it's actually all rights . And even though there is this humping the floor because the foot wells huge , it's not too bad . It's all right for the middle person , Really . The only problem is , is that if you've got to torture people in the back , they get pushed the sides and then the sloping roof does eat into the headspace . When you're sitting right , the edge there like that . So we threw in the back . It's not so great for the people on the outside , but find the person in the middle , which is a little bit unusual now .This particular car , it's got four zone climate control . We got digital controls here , which are pretty snazzy . Danville , eh ? You've got us be in puts their 12 volt socket , so that should help keep the kids happy with all the electronic devices .So too , with the fact that you got some huge rear windows on this ledge isn't too high , so smaller people can see .And if you need to carry long writing is you can just fall down this middle seat and you can have like skis or whatever in here , too . People sat in the out of two seats or if there's no one there , you for this day and you've got a couple of cup holders or arm rest . Terms of other storage , the door pins in the back of this car . Massive look , that's a big ball fits in there , no problem at all . And then you've got some took some stories in its there , though the elastic is little bit saggy like some old knickers .No , if I move to the back into this car , you'll see that it's actually been styled like this to look like an Audi Quattro from the eighties .So that's one for the car gates and I want for the families is the fact that this car's boot is pretty large , actually , a standard . You get an automated tailgate . Now the size of it is actually quite a bit bigger than that of a Range Rover sport , and it's a little bit bigger than that that you'll find in a BMW X6 now a bit of a load lip to lift stuff across . That's not too much of a problem . What's problem or oven issue is the fact that the boot is quite shallow . Just hurt the opening because of these sloped rear . Don't have such a problem on the Q7 , which is square at the back end . So if you try and laid things like upright or pack it right to the rafters , the boot doesn't like it . Much as you can see now , it's all . But though there's plenty of space in here , it's a nice square shape . Otherwise , you got things like a 12 up socket there , which is good for plugging in a vacuum to clean out the boot . With this bits and pieces storage into here along with the tire repair kit , there's no spare wheel on this particular car . Got here starts in various things in here . On look this specific netted areas , which is ideal for your organic spinach and love . This one's ideal for celery . How cool is that in this ? Um , tethering points here , and I like the fact you've got these led lights there , which help illuminate the boot . Now , if you want to carry larger items , you can't just do it from here . You have to walk around to the seats because that's where you fold them down here at the seat basis and they just snapped into place would be careful with this one . It's spring loaded , smacked in the head closes door . It is a bit of fat women to do that and also look load space isn't completely flat . It's a bit implying there , but it's not too bad . If you want more detail on this car's practicality , click on the pop out back in the top right hand corner the screen .You see just how much stuff you can fit in this car's boot , what it's really like with three adults in the back on just how easy it is to fit a child .See , now this sneaky way gets Audi is new interior design , so it has a nice A dash than in the Q7 . So it's very similar to the one that you get in the A7 on it looks absolutely lovely , so everything feels very high quality . There's no rattles or movement in the friend , and I really like the damn perfect this arm Rest . There's like an expensive car , and it should do , too , because it is quite expensive . Now , this particular one on site has leather upgraded here , here on the doors and more importantly , here on the dash , it makes it feel like a premium product .The only problem is you have to pay for that , so that grade will cost you �3000 . In case you're wondering , you could buy A5 fully grown live cows for that much money . I know that because I looked it up . They're gonna get one as a pet . After all . If you got bored of it , you could just ease it .Now , one of those standout features is this new entertainment system . So look , if I turn it off screen length out and it looks like a seamless part of the dash to use its pretty good when you're sound still . So it's a touchscreen , but it clicks and it vibrates . Uh , when you press a button , so you know , you've definitely pressed . It is quite easy to swipe through the different menus . Now , down below is another screen which controls all things like your climate control , your heat seating on calling if you've got it . So that is pretty easy to use as well . The issue comes when you're driving along . So all the other days have like a swivel will , which you control so you can just hold the wheel and operated while you're driving . This being a touch screen , you have to look down . And because the karmic controls on just like a button like a volume button , you can quickly swivel . It's harder to operate it when you're driving . Thankfully , you can operate most of the stuff on the top screen here through the digital drivers display Seacon scroll through different settings and men use the navigation , your phone , the radio media system . You can also change the views as well . Full widescreen satellite navigation , which is very , very cool like that . The Baron is in that while you were driving . Now , if you want full details in this causing detainment system for another look around the cabin , click on the pop up in the top right hand corner . The screen . Watch my detailed entertainment review .I just noticed something a little bit annoyed , so that is very in Audi . This gap here look , you can I don't know . Maybe it's there to store your credit cards .I think it's something to do with the fact of the screen has to vibrate what I can't complain about , though , is the seating position . So there's loads of adjustment in it . If you're a basketball player , you're gonna find enough room in this car . Look , I got a call petals on . If you're super sure you're going to be all right as well . There is one thing to watch out for that . This sloping green screen doesn't mean that if you like to sit a very , very close , you're going to be a bit close to the roof line in that nice on Dhe . You can also get electric adjustment for the steering wheel .Thing is , that is a �400 option , and you're gonna set it once and not really use it again . Who ? What a waste of money that would be .Speaking of Kit , all models start the s line trim and you get lots of kids standing . You get 21 inch Allah wills for lady headlamps .You get leather Alcantar receipts , the season .This car , actually the greatest sport seats thes �2500 on .Don't notice two problems with them . One is the fact the headdresses integrated , so you can't alter a tall on dit blocks of you somewhat for the people behind , bit more so than the normal seats . And on this particular car , when it's got these side bolsters that squeeze you into place using air bladders to hold you firmly when you get in the air bladder and this one seems to have broken , it's a little bit deflated . Haven't seen that before . One of these cars , so overly that's a one off , but it's not great , is it ?Moving swiftly on to storytelling ? Better got a big glove box . There's cup holders there , and they are big enough to hold a coffee cup . A swell on . We've got some huge side door bins look very large as well . Plus , there's a little bit of extra storeys down here . It's felt lines . Whatever you put in there doesn't rattle about good place to hide , have all five and then totally forget about it and think that you've lost it . Hopefully , remember that's there , If not , please reminding the comments below .Now then it's time for the car .While A5 annoying things about this car theory , windows don't go down particularly fides . Barely halfway that is it literally .This car has the thickest of fake exhaust as all in a straight now with a rather large Carli . Stick of truth . Look at this , Enough said .Well , the voice grins can understand normal ish speaks . Take me to McDonald's .Cole . The only problem is that what you can actually say still very limited . For instance , it's just sat nav radio stations on the temperature on Damn ! You can't think about the heated seats really well .This local is very easy to operate on . Dhe . Simple to remove very light . Unfortunately , there's nowhere to store it in the car when it's not in use other than in the big taking up space .For some reason , you can't assign the driving mode selector to this little shortcut button on the steering wheel , but you can in some other Audi is , and you really , really want to in this car because the drives , like most , are actually down here , and as their partner touchscreen , you company feel where they are . Ah , why did you do that ? Is really annoying .Don't worry . There's still plenty to like about this car . Here's the car . Wow !A5 core features the rare lights to this cool little dance . When you lock the car , they did again . When you open it , the front's do a similar thing , but you'll have to watch my video review the A7 to see that get the Q A8 with all wheel steering and a high speeds .The back wheels moving the same direction is the front wheels A8 high speed stability than at lower speeds . They move in the opposite direction of the front wheels to aid maneuverability . And actually , this car has the same turning circle , pretty much as a much smaller A3 as well as the normal reversing camera .To get standing , you can upgrade to surround the cameras and a lot of stuff without because you converted the car from various angles . Take your alloy Will's cub . Look at the top of the car . Look forward . You're a normal view . R8 widescreen view . A4 Go for 43 D mode , which allows you to look around the car from various on God's law . It's insane . It's like playing a video game .Check this out . The Q A8 has frameless windows . How call is now in an SUV normally only find out of sports ? Caf . Let's just say you're too feeble to push the door shut .It's got self closing . The curate has air suspension is standard , and you can lower the boot height by pressing a button in the boot , which is handy . That makes it easy . Load heavy items into the back . It's also good if you've got an old dog and you don't have to jump down too far to get out . Wolf .No , my baby car . But this curate is very easy to drive in town , so you might not see it quite high as you doing like a Range Rover . But the view out is still pretty good . This cost steering is so light . I mean , look at that . I can do it with my fingertips . If you're trying to do U turns and we've round things in town , that's great . And of course , if you got the ray well staring , then it's super easy . I also like suspension , said the air suspension is super comfy over bumps .I mean , just irons them out in the road , even though this car is riding on 22 inch wheels .One thing I'm not too keen on , though , is the response of the automatic gearbox . So let's say , see a gap in traffic . If law the throat to make it .That was the two or three second delays . Insane is just gonna leave . You're floundering now . You can , of course , put the gearbox into sports mode . It does make it a little bit more responsive , but not by much . Still , once you are up to speed , this gearbox does blend the gives together pretty well . I won't look . You can change gears yourself if you have this upgraded steering wheel .So this car driving here is the three litre V sixties , or with 286 horsepower . You go from 0 to 60 in about 6.3 seconds . It does make a bit of a raw decenas de easily in the noise , and it makes . However , this engine does have a 48 volt system rather than the normal 12 volt you have with most cars , and that means it's got mild hybrid technology . The car knows when you can coast on . It will void braised accelerator pedal to encourage you to lift off the pedal , and then the call will just free wheel on . That helps it safe . You'll also the stop start system can cut the engine before you come to an actual star on . The combined effect of that is improved economy , Apparently . So what am I getting out this car ? 34 mpg , which is just okay . So I'm not sure just how well those clever systems have worked . Well , actually built this car with two of the diesel engines , a less powerful version on a more powerful version . Plus , there'll be a V six special on DDE in future , Plug in Electric hybrid and also possibly an or S8 performance petrol version . But we shall see about those now you're on the motorway traveling at speed . This thing feels just so relaxing .It's very , very quiet .Also , super planted feels really secure . It's a bit like a prop forward , and you could make it even better as well . If you have the semi autonomous driving system , I think it's called a tall pack . What that does is important . The cruise control . It will keep us safe distance from the car in front , it leave , and shouldn't you long in stop , start traffic until auto steer the car to keep it in lane as well ?So what happens when you encounter a twisty road ? This car handles very well for a big thing . It's based on the Q7 , but it said it to be more sport . It does feel a little bit more agile now . I can put it into dynamic mode and that Lowe's their suspension stiffens it up a bit , and obviously you got Quattro or we'll drive traction . It Z8 surprising how well it goes round corners .But there is , of course , only so much you can ask of this thing because , after all , it is large and heavy . One thing you can ask of it , though , is to tow up to 3.5 tons , which , yeah , if you're into that kind of thing , is it's impressive .Now , if you want more information or to find out much you can save in a queue AIDS or any new car , for that matter , Clinton the pop out banner in the top right hand corner , the screen to get a car . Wow , So that was my verdict on the new Audi Que A8 should do avoid it , should you consider it Should he's short list it , or should we just go right ahead and buy it ? Well , I reckon you sure short list the new cue A8 .It's really good . Stylish car .It's just the Audi Q7 . Yeah , well , not as good looking is better value .

199,275,GLK350,"Audi best described the new Mercedes GLK350 . You know , this is like Chuck Norris in the small luxury SUV class , just like Chuck Norris . This Mercedes was sleep .It just waits on , just like Chuck Norris . This Mercedes isn't mind getting dirty a little tough and dirty , that is , with 260 horsepower and full time all wheel drive when the going gets tough . Well , you know this tough Mercedes-Benz going .You know , unlike the Lexus or even available , which compete directly against the Mercedes , this car feels really connected with road . You know , I almost feel like I could , uh , toss it around . I know that's a word that you don't use with SUVs too often , but this one does feel possible .Ah , that's a weird word to be using possible for a big , tall SUV . But you know what ? If it wasn't for the numb steering , this car would almost be sports car like , especially if you're just a speed of the video .See , it's a sports car with a seven speed automatic on an engine with £258 feet of torque . Of course , the downside to having almost 300 horsepower in the V six is it ? Get up averaging about . I'm getting 16.7 miles a gallon , which , you know frankly , isn't all that great . And , of course , the upside to having almost three horsepower . Well , it's this that would be a 0 to 60 time of just over seven seconds and no videos . Feet adjustment needed .Sometimes even Chuck Norris prefers the finer things in life , like an automatically opening tailgate Mercedes-Benz .This count does not disappoint with supple leather and find wood .And , of course , a huge dual sunroof that lets the sun in keeps the bad guys out .And , of course , their standard modern and mandatory multifunction user interface that's frankly quite confusing . Best to turn the radio off . Just listen to the way .With a base price of just over $36,000 this car certainly hits the sweet spot in the small luxury SUV market . But my car came in at over $45,000 fully loaded . It really depends what you're looking for . You want beautiful or do you want tough ?Yep , GLK350 V s . And just like Chuck Norris , you could probably lead a horse to water and make a drink . This is Woman Micah reporting for TfL car dot com"
200,276,SL,"more technology built into my seat in the entire verse of the Dave just reviewed . It has three levels of cooling three levels of heating . It has four levels of massage . It has side bolsters that push against my side every time I make a turn . It has about 80 different adjustments . And best of all , it has three levels of air scarf that blows across my neck on a chilly night .Once upon a time , actually , not that long ago , a fine horse was a sign of wealth , power and prestige . Today , not so much today . It's this . Check it out . The brand new 2013 Mercedes-Benz es el . We're gonna take it for a ride and review it . Coming up next on the fast lane car , this Mercedes fort licked a cell or sport light is not exactly light , but it does encompass A3 traits that make it a halo car for Mercedes .And those are power , prestige and technology .So let's start with power .For over 60 years , the S L have continuous production , and during those years , Mercedeses stuffed about every possible engine under the hood .And by far my favorite is this V8 4.6 liter that produces over £500 feet of torque and get this gets 19 miles to the gallon combined , which means that it avoids a gas guzzler tax of the last generation . Pretty cool and crazy fast .You know , it's not the 429 horsepower that's gonna rocket this car to 60 into the £516 feet of torque and the twin turbos . And let's see how fast we can get this to 60 . Could we do it in under five seconds ? The car magazines say it's just around four . You can do it . Here we go . Way go that 16 0 yes , indeed , to people in the car . Really world testing 4.80 now that is fast . That is seriously fast , I guess for 120,000 you're gonna get fast from this angle .In my opinion , it looks downright frumpy . In fact , it looks like it was designed by a committee , maybe three different people . Bronze at the front , I d to the middle on the interior and Hans in the back . Not good from this angle . It's mean , menacing and elegant , and that's a hard combination to pull off in the course with his giant star . You'll never be in doubt as to who build this car .Your stop watches , S8 says . 15 seconds . Four top to come down . That's pretty darn quick . Now look at that . Got glorious outside .Inside with my finger , I push sport , and all of a sudden this car's suspension adjust within a millisecond to the driving conditions . In other words , if I'm flying around this turn , which I'm gonna do right now , you gotta love that door . It is completely flat neutral , some with yours . I have called this hearing a little numb , breaking the little nonlinear , and , you know , I could see that this is not the sharpest knife in the drawer . However it's not supposed to be . It's not a race car , it's a G T . And for that I think the balance steering and even the breaking are fine .If you want a car that's better looking than this cell that competes with it , definitely go for the Aston Martin .If you want one , that performance better go for the Porsche 9 11 If you want one with available , we'll drive . Get the BMW 6 50 if you want the better exhaust note on that British panache . Go for the Jaguar X K bar .However , if you want one that does everything all around go for the SL .You didn't think you'd be bothered to open the trunk yourself ? Did you force that it's a Mercedes SL , but there is a fly in the ointment , and it's This stupid cover basically protects your stuff when their top is down . But if you get it wrong like this not quite in place , watch this . Nothing happens . Trunk one . Close the roof . One . Open the roof . One close . It's like something out of here from 10 years ago . Not good doctor to go . Whoa says me .I have never driven a car with so much technology .The skin is aluminum . The roof to save weight is magnesium .Every creature comfort that you can think of is in the car , including heated and cooled seats and , of course , the air scarf , which blows a gentle breeze on your neck .When the nights get chilly and perhaps the biggest party trick Magic sky Control , check it out with a touch of a button , the sunroof turns clear , and with the touch of a button turns opaque . How cool is that ?Oh , yeah . The horse is still a sign of power , wealth and prestige . And so is this Mercedes-Benz CFL scale of Buy it . Lease it rented for Forget it .I'm gonna have to give it a buy it because 429 horsepower and better yet £516 feet of torque will always put a huge smile on my face .As always is Roman and my buddies horses reporting for the fast lane car seat ? Next time I'm gonna drive it to more .This one sounds better . Fortune does . That sounds better than forsooth ."
201,277,SL 450,"Ladies and gentlemen , meet the refresh 2017 s , l 4 50 The least expensive , least powerful SL that you can buy from Mercedes .In fact , this car starts at just over $86,000 . The most expensive SL . That's over 219,000 .But the question is , just how fast is the slowest Mercedes-Benz SL ? And the answer is coming up right now .They're not one , not two , not three , but four . Some models that you can get , and they all come with a twin turbo . This is a smallest . It's a six cylinder that puts out 362 horsepower and £369 feet of torque . It's made it to a nine speed automatic transmission . If you get the big boy Mercedes , you get a twin turbo V 12 that puts out 621 horsepower . The question is , how fast is this from 0 to 60 Mercedes-Benz 4.9 seconds , But that is at sea level . When we are a mile above sea level , the twin turbo should help make up for a little bit of the loss in air density , but still potentially this car could be slower than what ? Mercedes , But then Mercedes-Benz R8 it . No , we're gonna do a couple different runs here . The first run . I'm just gonna do it in comfort mode because there's this belief out there that sport mode is faster than comfort mode because Karsh it's faster . But what we found in our testing is that when you flora car , it gives you all the beans , no matter what motives in . So let's see if that's true . So the first year of S60 we're gonna do and comfort mode , then we go back down the track and we're gonna do it in sport mode and they're gonna do one where we break torque the engine to get hopefully the fastest time . And I'll do that in sport mode as well , just to make sure that you guys are happy . So here we go . Let's get this thing a shot . Would help by putting your no break talking . Just floor . It S60 6.18 seconds , 6.18 seconds .I can control a lot of different variables on this Mercedes . First and foremost , I can go from comfort to sport sport Plus , which changes the suspension setting the steering and , of course , how quickly the car shifts .But my finger part is it also changes the exhaust note . Let me show you . So this is the exhaust in comfort mode , and here's the exhaust In sport plus mode , this is comfort , and this is sport plus put in sport plus mode . The exhaust changes baffles open . It sounds better , but let's see if it's faster . Here we go .It was actually slower 6.31 right there . Sport mode was slower than comfort mode because once again , the algorithm and the engineers that right the elegant realized that when you floor it , you want all the beans you want all the power that this car has .Ah , just because you get the least powerful SL doesn't mean you get the least luxurious .In fact , this cost just over $108,000 that's because it is stuffed full of options , including check this out soft closed doors for $450 a $5000 bank analysts and sound system and air scarf that wops warm air onto the back of your neck on a cool night . And of course , it has massaging seats and , of course , a magic , transparent roof that , with the touch of a button , transforms how much light comes into the cabin .Here we go , guys , this time on a break , torque it . Which means I'm gonna let the turbos spool up . That means my left foot is on the break . My right foot is on the accelerator way . They're S60 . Look at that . 5.53 5.53 So the difference wasn't in the fact that the car was a different boat . Difference was in how it launched the car .That guy's a 5.65 so I think we proved a couple things first and foremost . A mile above sea level is slower , so we found that if you were at sea level , that's about a second difference . So that time would be about 4.5 . It's available . The other thing we've learned is a comfort mode in sport plus mode have no direct impact on how fast car accelerates for an entry level .S L .This car is pretty darn luxurious and pretty darn fast , so if you have a daughter who's turning , let's say sweet 16 and you don't want to spoil her with the AMG 65 . There you have it . The perfect car for that sweet 16 gift that's still fast , still safe and still fun to drive , as always , is Roman reporting for the fast lane car .

202,278,E 350,"G20 14 Mercedes-Benz e 3 50 Formatted Coop . That's a mouthful , and this car is absolutely gorgeous . In my opinion , Check out these headlights in these led accents . It used to be the BMW had the best accents . Those angel eyes and Audi jumped on the bandwagon . But now Mercedes-Benz has topped them all , at least in my opinion . So today we're gonna do a 0 to 60 tests because you couldn't tell by this guy . It's about the snow here in Colorado . Now , this car does have all wheel drive , but it has 18 and summer tires , and when the snow starts falling , it's gonna be absolutely useless up here .Under the hood is a direct injected , 3.5 liter V six that puts out 302 horsepower and £273 feet of torque . It's made it to a seven speed automatic transmission that powers all four wheels . Thus , the Four Matic . I'm kind of curious to see how fast it will go from 0 to 60 in sport mode and an eco mode , I bet will be very close .Give it a little bit of torque , and just for it , A4 wheels lock up . Since this is a four Matic on , there is 50 . It's fast there . S60 . Oh , that is very surprising . Chicken out guys , check it out . 7.18 Wondering if in sport mode I could break into the sixes might be possible . Keep in mind if you're at sea level , that will be about a second faster , even , perhaps a little bit more . So let's try it one more time . This time , we'll do it in sport mode . Same exactly same launch except that will be in sport mode .Uh , and we'll give another Santa now this Mercedes-Benz lines in six and 1/2 1000 rpm . But computer will only let it go to four and 1/2 1000 that's the way it is today with modern cars . Unfortunately , Computer does more controlling of the vehicle to the driver , all right , with one finger .I'm switching it to sport mode there sport mode , and I'm gonna do the exact same thing I did last time . Torque it just a little bit and 0 to 60 . Here we go . A little bit of talking and way stronger . Supposed to rip this shit a little sooner , sounds better and there is 60 .Look at this in sport mode .Wow , identical time going the other way . Once again , I know how to computer control . It's hard to believe that the car would have the identical time with me . Just boring .You know what I think is happening . I think when you floor it either an ICO mood or in sport mode , the computer says this driver wants as much power as I have . I'm gonna give him the fastest possible acceleration by making this car shift as quickly as possible . And basically the car is giving you all the beans in either mode . That was kind of interesting .And we're hoping to do a full review once the snow melts after , of course , it falls . Now this car does compete with other coupes like the Audi A5 .But here's something interesting . Check this out . When you get in the Mercedes , you put the key in . You turn it , look at this and hands you your seat belt like a butler when you put it on . And here's the other interesting part . It tightens up when you start the engine . Come on , tighten up . There it isn't .He scares me as always . This is Roman reporting for the fast lane car . Thanks for watching and come back for the full review the next time , Joe .Oh , all right , guys , You could tell I'm on sheer ice on an incline and I don't want to fall . But Nathan's behind the wheel of the brand new 2014 Nissan Rogue . Say hi , Nathan Nathan . Now , the cool part about the rogue is that it's got this feature where if the front wheel slip , it allocates power to the rear wheels , and we're gonna show that on this incline on pier ice . So , Nathan , go on up your ice . I can't even get up this hill . I can't get up this hill . Whereas beneath Son Rogue and Nathan had no trouble . So you know what's coming up next ? The brand new 2014 rog broke off road review"
203,279,GL 63 AMG,"states . An apple near the fast lane car behind me . The brand new Mercedes-Benz G l 63 AMG . Kind of badass looking , isn't it ? It is . Twin Turbo charged me vicious vehicle . And I've been trying to think about who would drive such a vehicle , because it's a really limited limited . I got an idea . Stay right there . Stay right there . Under . Come here . Start started . Just don't argue . See this coming ? Yeah . No , no . Stop right there . Okay . All right , Stay . All right , Cross your arms . All right , Now say something in Russian . Mean in the right . A7 Mercedes-Benz . Yeah . Okay , that's good . I figured it out . Thank you . Going back to work . Perfect for Russian gangsters and coming up next at nearly $127,000 .Is it worth it ?Check it out , baby . AMG . They don't screw around . This has very little to do with the regular power plant that you confined in ngl Mercedes-Benz . This engine puts out 550 horsepower in £560 feet of torque , and it's fed through two turbo chargers to a seven speed automatic transmission that has been heavily heavily modified by AMG . If you combine it and just put everything together . You have an engine that is able to propel a vehicle that weighs merely on .I'm not kidding nearly Okay , I'm sorry is this is too funny when you think about how heavy it is . Okay , so it's nearly £6000 . That is a lot That's new A3 tons like God .But when you see how fast this thing goes , it moves like a scalded cat .It's worth noting ways , ferocious way , but there goes . But the problem is traction control is really intrusive . So it's like I got my foot on way down right now . It won't let yeah until it feels that I'm in a good position to go now .Granted this 120 something $1000 vehicle . So the last thing I want to dio is , um , roll off the pavement and G does more than throw on an engine and transmission and big wheels .They do a lot more and you can really see it in the exterior design . They have gone from a fairly tasteful , simple design with the G L to AA lot more bulky , lower looking vehicle . And in doing so , they've really made something that looks like it could , like , blow through ah , border into another country very quickly . Or you could have somebody here handcuffed as you're trying to extort money from them .But more importantly , you have these amazing 21 inch wheels , which I said they're just beautiful , fantastic as a whole .It obviously is a little low , and it definitely has a lot of street presence , but at the same time , I kind of like the way BMW does their X5M over the way this is done , that one looks a little bit more purposeful . That's just me .It's heavy steering . Steering , frankly , doesn't communicate very well . Wait is okay once you set it up . Whoa , whoa . You got the rear end out a little bit .You know , taking traction control off . It's kind of a scary prospect that I'm saying so much . Wait here . Wait .I think its exterior and engine are gangster than the interior is boss . Bottom line . One of the nicest interiors I have ever seen in a crossover or SUV . They have outdone themselves . An AMG always does this with the interiors , but in this particular case , mixing up this beautiful , dark world would with the dark leather and raised white stitching and the most comfortable seats out there . Ah , it's just a fantastic place to be . But with that being said , I need to show you something in the back seat .If you have somebody that gets into the vehicle and you don't put up the head rest , they're going to be in pain . So this has to go up before anybody sits down . You have to remember that , honestly , it's uncomfortable . Otherwise . Now the third row seats . Yes , they do have a little bit of space . No , not enough for a good size adult . I would go back there , but I am absolutely terrified of the prospect of actually hurting the seats themselves from me trying to get in and out . I tried it once .It wasn't pretty way faster that time . Yeah , it was faster .5.43 They're good . Yes , five point So , but I have second slower than sea level . It's still really , really , really , really , really fast . It's , um yeah , it's quick , you know , you forget because there's so much power that this thing weighs pretty much close to three tons . That's heavier than a lot of pickup trucks . There's a lot of meat in this thing .It can tow up to £7500 . Do you think about that ? You know , like I'm towing with an AMG . That's just weird . Maybe a Lamborghini on a flat bed or something , and then these seats to fall down at the push of a button . But because the cargo covers in the way , I'm not gonna fold them down all the way . But they do fall flat , and that leaves a lot of extra space also underneath here , where you'd expect to see a spare tire . Oh , there is no spare tire . What you have is a inflation kit , but there's a little bit of storage down there as well . Great place to keep weapons . Bottom line is that this is a vehicle that really does have some utility and has a ton of comfort .And the end of the day .I still can't imagine anybody talking with no ballerina tell you that with that being said , the engine note is glorious . Come on , There you go .Your voices bear . It's your voice . A beer ?What a beast ! I mean what I mean , just Varis t angry crossover SUV . Wow . And I've been trying all day long to figure out who this vehicle would appeal to end what it competes against . And I honestly can't come up with too many solid things other than let's say you had a Dodge Durango , Artie . And you wanted something bigger and better . Meaner . And you had a lot of money to do it with . There you go .What have you How was it ? Yeah , not that good , huh ?Oh , hey , that's onto bad . Can you believe it ? A minute . 12 minutes .While I think you're actually almost pretty much tied the X5 that X5 drove a lot easier than missing the traction control absolutely murders this thing . But you know what ? If I didn't have the traction control , I'm pretty sure there's three different places where I would have flown off the track .Three tonnes do this thing's nearly three tons e . I kind of feel the spirit of Lewis Hamilton yelling at me when I go around the corner telling you how horribly I've done that corner when I'm driving this , it's a beast . So on the old scale of by at least rented or forget it , of course , I'd give it a buy it , but realistically , I would never do that . There are . It's just too big . It's just too much . I think that I'd give it a lease . It something you lease and then you could scrub the blood out of it before you return the least . You know what I'm saying , right ? It is an awesome vehicle that around a track , man , you really got to try it because it's just so big and mean for the fast lane car .

204,280,C class,"This is the brand new 2015 Mercedes-Benz C class to new engine choices .New exterior styling , new interior .But does new mean better And we're gonna find that out next . Coming up on the fast lane car now .Style wise . New C class looks a lot like the S class . In essence , a baby s class is a strong family resemblance and all the German manufacturers air doing that . Think of the BMW three series . Looks like the seven series like the five Siri's . What is new on this car is this . Can you hear that ? That's aluminum . Pretty much every external panel on this car is aluminum , which means that it's £200 lighter and that's a lot that's 1/2 a Nathan way under the hood , there are two engine choices , and by far this is the one you want .It's the new re later twin turbo that puts out 329 horsepower and 300D £54 feet of torque . That is a lot of talk and a lot of power . All that is fair to a seven speed automatic . And this is the formatting , which means it is powering all four wheels . Now let's stick a for a ride and see what that power translates to when we get the car into the Twin Cities .Now there are two versions of this , at least right now only to the C300 , and this E400 and C300 starts at about $38,000 . If you want to jump up to Big Boy Twin Turbo and you're gonna have to start in $48,000 mpg has been announced and it's actually really good .It's 20 to city and 29 highway A4 combined 24 which for a car that puts out over 300 horsepower , quite frankly , is phenomenal .Now this C class obviously competes with the BMW three series and the Audi A4 out of those three cars . This by far is the most elegant . It's the nicest in my mind . The BMW is just a little too austere , and the Audi is getting a little long in the tooth . This interior is elegant , it's stylish , it's soft and it looks expensive . And really , that's what you want . When you're getting a Mercedes , you want something that's expensive and says I've made it so the big question , How does it drive ?Well , let's find out . Let's go for a ride together and see how this car differs from the previous generation . I can immediately tell you that it feels and drives a lot bigger . This car , like almost every German car , is one size bigger than used to be . Think of the three Siri's now the to Siri's slots . Underneath the same thing with this . This is more of , Ah , almost e class size car than a C Class . But that's okay because , well , obviously , this does compete with A3 Siri's . They're very different cars . A3 Siri's . That's the sporty one , right ? That's the one that you want to go tear up a track with this . This has always been the more luxurious one , and that theme continues in this model . Besides being lighter , this new C class is also bigger .In fact , it's more like an e class , and that just translates to a lot more room back here four inches longer . And of course , that means more knee room and more leg room head room just a little bit tight .That's because I've got this really cool optional panoramic sunroof in Florida .There's a little bit of turbo lag and oh my gosh , that torque just kicks in and you're pushed to the back of your seat and it just feels phenomenal . But because it's a lot bigger car , it doesn't feel quite as agile . It doesn't quite feel like it wants to dance as much as perhaps the three Siri's . But that's okay . This is more of a grand touring car , something that you want to take across the country and perhaps use for a launcher . Paller .What is now almost obligatory in any new luxury or near luxury car is the ability to change the settings from , in this case , ICO to comfort sport , sport plus toe individual . And that's just the way to the steering in this car . Since we have air suspension , it also changes the stiffness of the suspension . And , of course , it adjust the throttle response . Does it work ? Yeah , it works . You know what I'd like , though ? I'd like when you go into sport or sport . Plus , I'd like more horsepower , not just for the engine to be in a higher gear .All this stuff in here , all this is coming down from the Mercedes-Benz s class . So you've got the full suite of safety features , including , basically the ability for this car to drive itself , which is actually really cool stuff . Like it'll hit the brakes for you if it thinks you're about to crash into the car or object ahead of you flying tight monitoring , active steering In essence , all the sweet of technology that was first introduced in the S class that went down into the clients and now is in the C class and that technology transfers happening much quicker , used to take probably at least one product generation . And now , within a year or two of the nicest stuff being introduced in the top model , you'll find it in the same model in a much lower price point .So $40,000 starting , you know , it's a Mercedes .You're gonna pay for that . And while we say this is still a C class , we didn't wanna build a vehicle that , uh , you know , we've been able to build a new E of the new s class , but it's taking all the characteristics from an S class when it comes to design . When it comes to quality , fit and finish and apply them to a C class , So yeah , it's a different . It's a different world , and we think this is something that our customers are really , really looking for .The other interesting thing about this car , quite frankly , is that when it goes on sale , it will only be available in the all wheel drive version . I think that's because all wheel drive is becoming an essential component of luxury . People looking over the drive cars and they say That's a luxurious car , so Mercedes-Benz the decision , even though it's more expensive . But they're gonna introduce this car in both the 304 100 in America with initially on Lee all wheel drive for Matic .The other big news in this Mercedes is , well , right inside . Here . It's this miles touch pad . As you can see , there's the old Mercedes command system , which still works like the previous generation with a little bit bigger screen , I would say , but now you can also control it with this touch pad . It's kind of a cross between an iPhone or you can zoom into things and then zoom back out . And of course you can write letters . So if you wanted to look up a contact in your address book . It's nice . I'm not sure . Like all these systems , it's quite ready for prime time . But in general , I like this system better than this one . You've got both , so you can pick which one you like .All right , so not talking . Let's do some driving . They put it in sport . Plus on , you know , this car behaves when it's a little bit twisting . The steering is Elektronik , of course , and love people complaining about Elektronik steering . And I don't mind that , you know , I think it's waited nicely . I have a really good sense for what the wheels are doing . I can push this car around in a very confident manner . You know , the great thing about developing a car for the autobahn is that when you take it on slow roads like this , it still has that moto bond poise . It feels rock salad . It feels like it's on rails for lack of a better nine , Please , Shane Terms and this Mercedes-Benz all of that .I love this A6 steering wheel .I love the way that receiving position is comfortable yet sporty . A lot of cars that have problems with height wise head fits , and I just , uh I'm impressed by how quiet this is . There is little bit of a whistle , but that's a camera on the roof . It's not the car . Mercedes has gone to extraordinary lengths to make this very quiet .And even when you Florida , a lot of power , not a lot of sound so aboutthe four cars in this category that I'm gonna talk about , I think that this is probably right now the most luxurious BMW is this 40 est . Obviously the Audi A4 is the oldest , so it's kind of on its way out . Cadillac A . T s . I think most directly competes against this and , of course , Alexis I as well , that's a size smaller , so it's much more of , ah , nimble car . It's almost what this car used to be . At some point , it really depends on what flavor ice cream you like , you know . Do you like chocolate luxury and then going for this car ? Do you like sports ? Go for the BMW . But overall , I am very impressed by what Mercedeses done to make this car a true driver's car in kind of the best sense of German automobiles , with the car . And this gave that C300 for Matic is up to £200 lighter than its predecessor .Yes , I think a big news . I mean , basically , every single panel on the outside is aluminum . Almost every panel correct , except for the re offender , I think which is ? Which is steel . And , you know , we're not just doing that to reduce weight .Obviously , reduction weight gives you better performance gives you better handling , especially with that new falling for on suspension and increases fuel economy .So it really is like , it's like you're probably £25 out of this car , right ? Exactly . And you know , if you've ever lost £25 you know what it feels like . So , um , you can feel it right away .When you start driving this car , it's ah very different tending the heavier than its predecessor .So it's bigger . And yet it's lighter already . Z4 reasonable . Often , as my boss always says he was , she could do that from generation to generation . Get get bigger , more more handsome in the at the same time , lose lose weight .I would be very happy owning this car , but you need to spend a little more time behind the wheel , actually find out all the little niggles and all the little bits and pieces that you don't get driving in just an hour .So on the TfL scale of by , at least it , rent it or forget it . I'm gonna say I don't know because I won't get in the car for about an hour . And , as always , it's not fair to you . And it's certainly not fair to Mercedes to rate the car when you've only had a little bit of sea time behind the wheel . So you'll have to come back when we get this brand new C Class four Matic , which is great for Colorado into the mountains , and we can do a full on review . As always , this is Roman reporting for the fast lane car . Thanks for watching and check out TfL car dot com for more news , views and everyday reviews .Love , love Mercedes-Benz breaks really feels Planet really feel solid , and we're coming after the ski area , so slow down a little bit and enjoy the ride .And really , that's this car's about right . It's not about carving quarters as much as a BMW and maybe even to some extent the Audi . I mean this car is really about being a grand touring car , comfortable , luxurious , everything in here to make you feel special . And , you know , for the most part of those are some really nice touches .Like , for instance , these events , this wood grain , which is really bad steering wheel , a crazy , comfortable scene .Germans certainly know how to make a car comfortable . Big guys like me and I suspect it's comfortable for me . It's probably comfortable for you as well I'm going with ."
205,281,C300,"A4 . There's something sexy and magical that happens when you take a four door sedan , remove two doors , lengthen the front two doors and make it into a coupe . Or do you say who pay ? And this is the 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300 coupe . Mercedes is hoping that that's something is enough for you to spend your money on what is now a sexy to door . Instead of a more utilitarian four door C class and coming up , I'm gonna take it for a ride and let you know the entire scoop for 2017 .The C Class coupe is four inches longer and two inches wider . And there's this new belt line , this line right here that runs throughout the entire length of the car Mercedes-Benz that it has more of that sexy Coke bottle shaped . You agree ? I'll leave that to you . It's been designed from the ground up to be a coupe this time around , so it does share some many components with the sedan . Obviously , the wheelbase the length of the same . It does sit about an inch and 1/2 lower .The actual height of the vehicle on gets unique styling all the way around weight mass and 1/2 to this car that you could feel right away when you get behind the wheel . And that is because , well , it feels like it's put together from one solid piece of granted .Well , there you have it . It's a direct injected turbo charge to leader that puts out 241 horsepower and £273 foot of torque . Now it has made it to a seven speed automatic transmission that comm power either the rear wheels or if it's a four matic , all four wheels , which is great for places like here in New Hampshire , where there's plenty of snow and plenty of need for all wheel drive has different Dr moments .Let me show you . I can select those . So I start with sport . I can go toe sport plus , And of course , I could go to individual .And when you have a car like this one that has the air suspension , what that does is it changes the way the car drive . So right now , when I'm in sport , you can see that the cars now downshifting , so chips shift points . It also firms up . The suspension makes a searing a little bit faster , more precise , basically turns it into more of , ah , widely inactive car .More grunt to the exhaust note .Full disclosure Mercedes-Benz out here , too beautiful New England to test drive this car . And in case you're wondering , it competes with other German luxury cars like the BMW four , Siri's and , of course , the Audi A A5 Nickelback .Comfort . Yeah , this car is much more of a car where you can sit back , put your head up against the head , rest and just kind of cruise down the street . Enjoy the view from the panoramic window , and I feel kind of sexy behind the wheel because you do have a car that says I'm footloose and free . At least I hope that's what it says . Is that Is that what you're feeling ? That the vibe you're getting , that's the vibe I'm going for .Okay , so it does have a flat bottom steering wheel , which is of course , now mandatory for any car with sporting ambitions . But don't take the card . It's word this is much more of a grand tour than it is a canyon carver .There is definitely a sense of the outside being outside and the inside being my own private space . The seats are ultimately adjustable Mercedes-Benz the best in the business seat adjustment . It comes to your fingers , and it's very easy to use . So whether you are six foot two like me or much well , it's a diminutive in stature . You can find a comfortable seating position .A lot more attention was focused on its design , so the wood trim on the side here actually ends a little bit earlier than it would in the sedan . And you get a very nice flowing line that actually carries the upholstery color towards the back of the door and actually through the front of the still here very , very high quality materials and find the sedan as well .But for the most part , you're still going to get the room and the comfort that you would expect out of this . A dancer , you still get everyday practicality forever , except for the back . Yeah , it is a little bit smaller on , and actually it is smaller than the outgoing car . I've got my doubts about this . This is obviously a two door coupe , A8 with a little bit less headroom , but seat retracts out of the way , As you would expect for Mercedes to do so , Let me try toe get my big American But in here knocking over the camera . All right . Oh , my verdict is I don't fit . How about my legs ? So far , so good . So far , so good . This is where I drive and yeah , the seed automatically moves forward because it senses that there's somebody back here .But I do like the one easy to use handle to make the seat move forward .It's very tight back here . If you're looking for a car that seats for , you may want to look at the regular C class , not the coop A8 .But that was done to you . Really keep the styling of the car with us where we put the focus on the airplane , but lower . You know , for tall guys like you and me a little type actor , correct , but still very practical .Actually , they are split folding 40 2040 rear seats so very , very usable .Even if you can't squeeze someone back there for a short drive , there's two shifts .It is sporty , but not fast . If you understand what I mean by that character of the car is more of a relaxed grand tour . Even when you do change the shift points and the suspension setting in the wheel dynamics , it just feels like it wants to go straight , as opposed to making a lot of turns out . That's not a bad thing . Every car can be a canyon carver .The Mercedes C Class coupe starts at right around $43,000 . This particular test car is just over $57,000 if you load it up with all the bells and whistles , including air suspension , A4 Matic , all we'll drive , then you can get north of $62,000 car to be considered , at least in my book , sporting or fast , it has to be a sense of what the road is doing .So , Chris , between going around a turn like this , you don't just want the wheel to feel heavy . But you wanted to communicate what the road is doing . So when the car's weight shifts because it will shift especially you taking quarters fast from the front wheels to the rear wheels , you know when that's happening . So that's when you know to put on the gas to give it as much potential power out of the corner as possible and oftentimes new electric steering cars . And what I mean by that , of course , is that these cars have gone to electric steering . They've lost that kind of tactile feel of actual road surface way . The tire is loaded and unloaded the way that the car is rotating around its center of Mass . It's hard to feel any of that through the steering wheel .This is probably another very dramatic section where you can tell the changes from a sedan . So whereas the sedan has tail lights that are stuck into the rear fender here following other Mercedes-Benz coop designs , the tail lights here actually flow into the deck lid of the vehicle on .They're always full wraparound led .That's correct , going from the previous generation car that went out for model Year 15 which had the license plate and the trunk . It has been moved lower , which also gives you a more prominent visual of the Mercedes-Benz star , which also functions as a rear view camera covers .When you put the vehicle in reverse to protect it from elements and to keep it clean , this actually opens up and reveals your rear view camera Mercedes-Benz building solid cars now for the last several years , and this is no exception .It's comfortable . It's confidence inspiring . And there I say it . It's even sexy . But if you want the one that's not the grand tour but Canyon Carver , you know the MG . You may want to wait till this fall , when there's not one but two Angie versions of the C Class coming to a dealership near you . As always . Is Roman reporting for the fast lane car ? Check out . You know it's tfl car dot com for more news , use and , of course , riel world everyday reviews . See you guys next time .Hey , guys , it's Roman and I'm up here in the high country of Colorado and we're up here doing some prototype hunting .

The question is , can we go and chase them down so that we could get you some better video of these"
206,282, AMG G 63,"$167,000 .That is a lot of money for this brand new 2019 Mercedes-Benz G 63 AMG and coming up with this video , we're gonna answer a very simple question . Is it worth it ? Plus , we're gonna go into the details of this brand new car . We're gonna show you what's changed . What hasn't changed , how I fit in the car . And if it's any good on and maybe a little bit off road and that is coming up right now on the fast lane car .So you're 100 and $67,000 .You , of course , get a hand built V8 twin turbo that's built by in this case , Cory at good sites isn't sorry , Cory , if I must pronounce your name , this bad boy puts out get this . 577 horsepower . £627 of torque . It is made it to all four wheels . Be a nine speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters . And perhaps the craziest number of all these numbers is that this bread box , which it really is , will do 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds . And that is a lot of speed for a lot of money .Back in 1979 the Shah of Iran was thinking , Hey , I need a really good off roader and I happen to own a large chunk of Mercedes and I can place a large order cause I've got my own military . That is how the original G wagon was built .And 40 years later , you think that the show would have imagined a vehicle that puts out 577 horsepower , 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds ? I doubt it , but that is where we've come . A military vehicle with a very small 125 horsepower . Actually , the 1st 1 was only 79 horsepower diesel engine to a monster that could take on many sports cars .One of the hardest things in the automotive world to do is to design a car that's a retro car . In other words , a throwback . And Mercedes has walked that type rope in a very astute manner because this G wagon looks very similar to the first generation G wagon , and yet it's completely and utterly new . They're only three parts that actually or carry overs from previous model one is this little guy right there seeing this little squirter for the headlights ?The other thing that carried over is the door handle Mercedes-Benz . They've done that because they wanted to keep this .Yep . That's a vault like construction that makes this such a famous vehicle . And such while an iconic vehicle .And over here is the third thing they've kept Tire carrier .Everything else on this vehicle is completely new . And yet when you park them side by side to the old one , you'd be hard pressed to tell apart by just casually walking next door .You know , there are only two models of G wagon that you combine the US and that is this mg 63 with the Big Bi Turbo . And of course , the smaller G5 50 also has a V A4 leader , but it doesn't put out as much power in the difference from the outside is very simple .The G 63 AMG has this bull bar that only covers the front bumper , whereas G5 50 has a bull bar that covers the entire front , making it much more well , is it off roadworthy ? They're both pretty off road worthy . At least more off road worthy looking thing .So what , you guys think of these wheels ? Of course , they're 22 is . What else would you be rolling on ?This is unusual . Most wheels are now kind of blacked out . The midnight edition is really hot . And yet Mercedes-Benz vehicles kind of gone old school . That kind of matches the bull bar . You know what ? I kind of like it . Maybe the whole black thing is on its way out , and we're heading back toward a little bit more bling .So you may be wondering what's the biggest difference between the old G and the new gene ? And the biggest difference is inside . It's just a lot bigger . It's in fact , five inches wider and two inches longer , which means that you and your friend the driver here won't be sitting shoulder to shoulder .The interior has also been upgraded with Mercedes latest and greatest infotainment system you've got .Of course , he's wonderful , and I think very elegant events that have become kind of a hallmark of Mercedes design .Then you have this whole center section that lets you change the dynamics of the car from its driving dynamic to it's off Road ability .Too many cameras , too , of course , changing the exhaust note , which is by far my favorite feature of this car because they're butterfly valves in the exhaust and you can have a quiet or you can have it loud .The biggest evident with all the extra space is right here in the back seat . As you can see M6 to have plenty of head room , I've actually got plenty of knee room back in the old model . It was like being in prison back here .The only quibble I could pick with this is that we don't have a full size sunroof .Those are very cool for 100 and $67,000 would be nice to have , but you don't have a sun roof .You can have this Super Kush almost velour like headliner , and you know that's pretty elegant in its own right .And since this is a body on frame vehicle , that's right . It's still body on frame for all that off road goodness , it does a lot £6000 . That's not bad for something that is fast off road worthy and can pull a small horse trailer .Three letters for all of you on road types . I f s nu G now has independent front suspension , which makes for a much more controllable and compliant right on the road . How does it drive ? Well , let's get behind the wheel and find out the old one .I think they had pushed the chassis as faras they could . It just felt like it was under chassis did over Engine , which , in fact , it was basically too much power for chancy that was designed for 79 horsepower diesel engine .Now this new one with independent front suspension with much more modern construction techniques and still a shape that is , well , a breadbox drives much better . They're different driving modes , and I can select from individual to comfort to sport sport . Plus , it actually doesn't swallow around turns like the old one big . So you got on one extreme disability to go and drive around the world up Himalayas and on the other extreme , this ability to keep up with some of the fastest sports cars in the world and not just in a straight line , but also around a pretty Kirby section of road .The other thing that I like about this is it . Now I'm surrounded by something that doesn't look like it's from 1979 . I feel like if I pick up my wife in this and she gets into it , you'll understand that even though this car cost a lot , it's worth a lot .Now you might be wondering , What's the fuel economy on this bad boy ? And it hasn't been announced yet . But if you're asking about fuel economy , you probably shouldn't be buying a G wagon , right ? I mean , this is a vehicle that is all about status .And , of course , the elephant in the room when we have to talk about that is the fact that very few people , if anyone actually takes this off road Range Rover will tell you that in their vehicles , at least the first time that a new order takes it off road in seven years into the ownership of the vehicle . Or if he sells it or she sells it , the third owner and I'm guessing that's the same case . With this , you can take an off road . It is ultimately off road capable , but honestly , the problem is , any time you take something off road , you worry about trail damage and it will happen . Nevertheless , it could do it . And I think that's what is part of the huge appeal .And of course , this one also .So what does the new G wagon compete with ? Well , really Nothing you might think Wrangler , But this is worth three Wranglers , you might think to yourself . Range Rover . That's probably the closest competitors , but the Range Rover is more of a cross over . This is more of a real truck .You might think Bentley Bentayga that starts in about 225,000 . So it's even more expensive than this . Mercedes and I started this review by asking , Is it worth 167,000 ? And I have to say I'm a bit of a G wagon , G class , fam boy , and to me this represents my dream car . So keep in mind , I'm not the most unbiased reviewer , but I will have this vehicle .It's crazy and that it can go from 0 to 60 in 4.5 seconds , and yet you could take it over landing with the Baja Iraq , and yet you could take it rock crawling , and yet you could take it around the world .I mean , is that worth $167,000 ? Hell , yeah . You bet it is .As always , this is Roman reporting for the fast lane car . Check out a car dot com for more news use . And , of course , G wagon reviews . You guys next time also .Sorry . I just loathe crazy ."
207,283,E350 ,"You know , I could forgive a lot about a car based on how it looks . This particular car , it is gorgeous . I mean , I've never seen on E 3 50 Look as good as this one does . Not even the convertible just just just take a second and look at it . It's so sculpted , so beautifully built .This is Nathan Avlynn for the fast lane car , and I'm doing a fast take on the 2012 Mercedes-Benz E 3 50 wagons way with 3.5 litre engine that only puts out 302 horsepower , which , frankly , for something that weighs over two tons isn't quite enough .But if you care even a little bit about feeling the car driving , having fun on the road SUV's aircraft Sorry , that's the facts . If you really want to feel what it's like to drive and you have to have a vehicle that holds a lot of stuff , consider a station wagon thing .Stupid cruise control stock . I don't know if you can see it , but this little thing , this is where you think the turn signal is . But watch this ups . I'm now in those Chris control going 55 when I thought I was making a right turn . It's just Mercedes-Benz doing this for a long time , Theo .Second problem . Rear row seat . There is 1/3 row seat in this vehicle , but it is really , really , really , really small . So your children should be like pygmies if you want them .All right , I get it . I know it doesn't quite have the same backseat room as 1/3 row seat , this stupid minivan or some sort of cross over there . Enough . But most of your gonna put kids back here , and I guarantee you they're not to be as big and fat as I am . The good news is , this is still probably one of the best driving cars that has 1/3 row seat for the fast lane car .Nathan Adeline saying See you next time . Yeah , but do you fit Nathan ? Let's find out you're seriously not gonna close it on me , are you ? Oh , you bet I am . Don't do that . Anything . Ah , crap .He fits"
208,284,E550,"This is a brand new Mercedes-Benz e G550 cabriole A8 , and I could tell you the details like there's a new front face of 18 inch wheels . But you know what ? It's sunny . It's beautiful here in Oregon , and I've gotta cabriole A8 . So let's take the top down and go for a ride because , let's face it , a cabriole . A .It's all about top down driving , and this one with a 401 horsepower twin turbo V8 is no exception .Coming up next on the fast lane car .When manufacturers fly us out here on these driving events , sometimes I go and sometimes Nathan goes today , I'm lucky enough to be driving this e class . But here's a little inside information Mercedes-Benz you up with the driving partner and today my driving partners Heavy air for Miami one more time .You know , guys , get here from Portland . I envy you . You have some of the most gorgeous roads I've never driven . I mean , look at this . This road is phenomenal on in the brand new 2014 G5 50 cab with my friend Javier Mota . Now , you know , But it's it's so great before a recent you know , Why great way lucky today because it's a beautiful day . It's a beautiful day . But look at this road isn't a spectacular talk about a road test .This car's ability We've got a 4.6 liter that puts out 401 horsepower made it to a seven speed automatic transmission with course paddle shifters owe .This is and you know what ? I think this is a one way road . You better bathing narrow way going about 60 70 80 now 30 35 .The thing is that barbell in the curves , it really sticks in the road . I mean , it's amazing . It's a big car . It's like a veritable heavy , but like their suspension on the technology that goes into this car to make it go this way .It's like , really , the e class family is a large family . Let's face it , there's everything from diesel , which we just tested all the way up to the AMG versions , and I'm really amazed at how lively and sporting this cab areola is . Diesel I drove yesterday was kind of well , let's just call a traditional .It wasn't a lot of fun to drive , but let's look at this face religion . A convertible that competes with Audi A5 convertible .This is amazing . Of course , it's also expensive . I believe this one is , uh , around $85,000 . Yeah , Yeah , I think you had taxes and you know all the other stuff you're probably looking at , like $90,000 . That's a lot of money for a car .But it is a Mercedes that is packed full of safety features .Well , in effect , drive itself . Stop and go traffic . But as long as there's an off button , you're going to rule like this gives a rat's ass about back the self driving This is what driving is really about . Yeah , you're right .The brakes are phenomenal . Steering is direct . Ride is comfort moments where we're at right now is actually well dampened . I have a real sense of what the wheels are doing , and I feel like a race car driver . And I really appreciate the fact that you're not nervous because we're flying in this bad boy pretty quickly . Race car driver with a lot of styling .Thank you for being such a good sport . You know , you took it to the car .Let's face it , most people will not be driving this car this way , right ? This is way . Obviously , it's capable of doing it because , you know , again like the engineering behind these guards like so you know , the other Mercedes-Benz . But yeah , it's a luxury car that can really go fast in every way . You put the top on it like a completely different Let's just have fun with wrote Fantastic road , No tire noise whatsoever .You think you do like some kind of squealing at this point ?They're going a little bit of front plow there . You really feel weight of the engine is over the front wheel .So when you go into a corner like that , you start to get a bit of boys . Sure understeer . But for the most part , it's neutral .Just come up from the car . Damn , no people . There ain't no passing on this road .Now you're from Miami and this seems like a perfect Miami car .You put the top down , it's not too hot .Yeah , the thing at the thing in Miami with convertibles like in summer , you can only enjoy them at night because it's so hard , like , so if you go out like a no one with a convertible even have put the top up pretty quickly because , just , like , way too hot . When you go out at night , it's a different story because it's like you get the reason that you're really going in . One of these cars are driving down in Ocean Drive .You got the right color , man . We got silver , which is sealed barely . The red top ready Here are really , really cool . Yeah , This is gonna be a car that's gonna be classy for a long time .All right , guys , I have a confession . I left the soul D l on in my briefcase A3 to All right , guys , have a confession . I left a solo d l out in my luggage , so I'm gonna have to let you guess how fast this is from 0 to 60 heat in mind . It's got a twin turbocharged V8 that puts out 401 horsepower and just over £440 of torque . So here we go 0 to 60 . You guys get your stopwatch is ready to give it a little bit of goose . And there it goes . Oh , yeah .All right . How long was that ? I don't know . I'm thinking at sea level . We should be around 5 to 6 seconds .

209,285,A7,"where , ladies and gentlemen , this is a brand new Audi A7 . And under the skin , it is identical to the brand new Audi A6 . All the drive train the technology , the power plant are identical to the A6 . But of course , the A7 is a sexy one . The more expensive one , the one that is a little bit sporty year and coming up right now , we're gonna go over both the A6 and the A7 . We're gonna take him for a drive . We're going to show you what's under the skin . We're gonna find out what's more important nowadays . Is it hydrocarbons or electrons ? Because both of these cars are just a tour de force in new tech . And that's coming up right now on the fast lane car .Now , normally , at this part of the review , we talk about hydrocarbons gasoline . But now we don't get to talk about electrons because , well , let's talk about the gas part . It's a brand new three litre six cylinder that is now turbocharged instead of super charge , and it puts out 335I horsepower and £369 foot of torture made it to a seven speed s tronic . That's dual clutching Audi speak , and Audi says it goes from 0 to 60 and 5.2 seconds . The A6 doesn't in 5.1 because £100 lighter . But let me show you something interesting . I think it's right here . It's this red cable . And that's because this is also a mild 48 volt hybrid , which allows this car to do things like turn this gasoline engine off 15 miles and hour , which is right before you get to the stop sign so that it gets a 25 mpg combined , which is actually to better in the old cars 23 . So electrons in this case can be very fuel efficient .Now this point , you may be wondering to yourself what's the difference between the A6 and the A7 ? Well , the skin , of course , is different , but the biggest difference is right here .It's the fact that this is out his ultimate hatchback , and in the past , that has meant that because you had a very sexy and sloping tail , it's cut down on headroom for the back passenger .Audi says that they've increased headroom in the new model , so let's find out , unfortunately , stylish and sexy and practical don't often go together , and this is where the A7 has had a little bit of a compromise , and that compromise is still here . So while I do have adequate headroom and adequate near room , I'm sitting behind myself . If you guys really want room for three passengers , you probably want to go with the A6 and not the A7 because , well , you could certainly fold the seats out and get a lot into this hatch back when the seats are straight up like they are right now and the hatchback is closed .It's a little bit tighter back here , but from the outside , it's a lot better looking , at least in my opinion .Of course , Audi is known for its Cuatro all wheel drive system , and this A7 , along with the A6 have Audi is newest cuatro ultra , and that's an interesting system because what it does is it basically allows the car to become more fuel efficient by allowing the front wheels to do the driving now in the old front wheel drive biased all wheel drive systems . What would happen is the front wheels would lose traction . Let's say you're going around the corner and then the system would sense it and would send power to the rear wheels . And then the rear wheels would get power and immediately lose traction because they just got up and you go around the court in the back and would come flying out . That was not a great system , but Audi has thought of that . This is actually a predictive cuatro all wheel drive system . So while the front wheels do most of the driving , this car can actually predict when you're gonna need all wheel drive . So when you're going around that corner and the front will start to slip the rear wheels already engaged . But you don't get that sudden snap oversteer on snow , and instead you get the confidence of having all we'll drive even before you know you need it . At least that's what Audi claims .Now , both the A6 and this A7 are stuffed with new technology , including here at the rear wheels . You can get optional all wheel steering . That's right . These rear wheels will steer up to five degrees , and that's great for Carbon Canyon's makes a Carm or trackable , and it's also great for when you're parking because it's easier to park the car since the rear wheels decrease the turning radius .All right , guys , it's a little bit of counting 123 led screens , plus a heads up screen . I mean , this car has become much more technologically advanced and very similar indeed to your cell phone . So what Audi says is that people have learned how to operated smartphone , so this is what they have done with their new system .If you look at it , it's very similar to a cell phone . You basically have icons that could be swiped back and forth that can be touched . And because Audi believes that it's much easier toe control information through this touch screen , there's a haptic interface , so when you push the button , it gently pushes back against your finger , giving you the sense that you've done something . Now , is this a better system ? You know , I'm looking at all different functionality just in these two screens . I'm looking probably at 50 different functions . Plus , they're all the functionality over here . You know , if you own this car , I suspect you probably gonna have to bust out the owner's manual to really get very well acquainted with this because there's a lot of tech here . But I do love the fact that you've got Google Earth that could be now displayed on the main screen . You've got ways that could be displayed over here . And you've got about 1000 different ways that you can customize this car or 400 different ways . And you can set presets to customize these screens . Is it too much ? Techwood ? Depends how much you like this . If you like this , then this will probably become very intuitive . And best of all , there's also wireless charging . You can put your phone right here , close at the phone automatically charges . Plus , it syncs up wirelessly with Audi is latest version of its MM , my system and you are all good to go . Well , all good , as long as you know what all these functions do and there's a lot of functions . Check this out . Let me show you here even to turn on the lights . Now you have haptic feedback and a soft touch screen that actually goes from low beams toe side marker off eso no more traditional now , even for your headlights .So what's the easiest way to tell this A7 from the A6 . Apart from , of course , the hatchback . Well , it's right here . Check it out . This car has one too A3 A4 character lines across the hood , whereas A6 only has two . And this is kind of what I would call a modified Coke bottle shape . And what do we mean by that ? Of course . Coke bottles at classic sexy shape that shows you the haunches of the car shows you the big tires . This car is sleek in the front , But if you come with me back here , there was that classic Coke Bible shape . The haunches kind of come out , the tires get wider and fatter , at least visually , and it looks like it's much more aggressive . So Fleek in the front , aggressive and pretty tough looking in the back . And also , this is kind of interesting Designer pointed this out . If you look , the gas cap has been completely incorporated above this cut line so that it doesn't go into this line . Makes it a lot cleaner makes it a lot sexier . It's a small detail , but I like it .So of course , one of the cool things about Audi eases that you could actually figure center screen to whatever you want it , so you could course , put your music in their 20 mpg combined .That's away from the 25 . But on these trips , we do drive these cars pretty quick , so that makes a lot of sense . We're not exactly babying him around . We want to see how dynamically they handled .Speaking of dynamically , this guy's very neutral , right ? Going around these corners . It feels stable . It feels , well , Planet .It's not the Audi TT of the bunch , but it certainly is very neutral and very confidence inspiring others only one thing that's left to do , and I've got a straight bit of road coming up that is 0 to 60 in . I'm gonna let you guys time it out , he says . It's 5.1 seconds 0 60 in the A6 and 5.2 in this A7 because this is a little bit heavier car , actually , £100 heavier . So I'm gonna put this car . Let's see , let's pick dynamic mode . We got a street bit of road here . Let's make sure that our controls are as biggest possible . I think I'm gonna break torque it . I'm just gonna let let the engine do its thing . And you guys time It's Here we go . 321 floored on their 60 was at 5.1 seconds . You let me know in the comments below , please . I've been doing these drives long enough now where I can kind of get a sense of how fast that isn't it . About five seconds . It starts to really push you back into the seat in about three seconds . 0 to 6 , you start to get tunnel vision . So there was a pretty good push was very linear . There was a little bit of turbo lag .Now you'll notice that these air to 25 40 twenties and for 2019 all the A6 is any sevens . Get an upgrade in wheel sides . So now the based wheel is a 19 inch wheel . Then you go to this 20 and you can even get an optional 21 .And that is some serious amount of tyre on a car with Onley 335I horsepower . Yeah , only . So let's talk about how this car drives Now . One of the good things about a 48 volt system is that it does things like shut the engine off before you hit the stop sign or stoplight . So 15 miles an hour it will shut the engine off , making you coast to the stop light , and you won't know it because everything and there's a lot of electronics in here will remain on . But the engine will turn off , and it's relatively seamless , right ? The biggest complaint most people have with Stop Start is that whole car kind of shakes won . It turns back on , and it's kind of uncomfortable because if you're an old stop start system , the air conditioning may turn off , the heater may turn off , but here it's pretty much seamless . So that's a plus . Other pluses that Audi have always been kind of front heavy , right ? It's a trans versus the mounted engine , and all the wait is over the front wheels . You see , you just turned off .You tell the other cool thing about the new A6 and A7 is the doors air semi electric ? What I mean by that ? Well , check it out , get the clothes themselves . No more , having toe actually manually close the door like that . The car does it for you . Electricity can be a really cool thing , and with the 48 volt system .They put the battery in the back , giving you MME . Or less more weight in the back so it's closer to 50 50 . And that's important because Audi have never rotated on the center access . They've always kind of rotated on the front access . So when you go into a turn , you can feel that car's await . You could feel it pushing kind of feel a plowing , and with more weight in the bag you have less than that . It becomes much more neutral .Full disclosure . Audi flew me out here to drive this and the A6 . And if you're curious , these cars are hitting your dealerships as we speak , the A6 starts at just under $60,000 if you want to go sexy , you have to pay a little bit more . This one starts it just under $70,000 .Now I've got different driving modes , which is of course , now common thing . So I've got comfort auto dynamic individual , so I'm gonna go into dynamic and once again that changes a throttle response and changes shift points . It changes how plan of this car feels and dynamic voted , feels very planet . But don't get me wrong . This is a big car . It drives big . You could feel this car's half left incisors . You're pushing it around these quarters . And while it's not perfectly neutral with something that tends to happen with , oh , well , drive cars , it is never less confidence inducing Elektronik steering . Yeah , it's still a little not communicate inside . I tell what the front wheels were doing . That really doesn't matter . Most people , probably that overall , Even though this is A7 and it's kind of this 44 door hatchback coupe , it's still more of a GT car than a canyon carving car . In other words , it's more of a grand touring car than one that set up actually take out twisty roads .Is it too much to ask for frickin lasers for my headlights ? Well , not anymore , because this car can be had with high beam lasers . A4 headlights . How cool is that ?I gotta tell you , when the seven first came out , this was my dream car after confessed , and I love the fact that it had the hatchback so that I could throw my bike in the back . And I love the look of the thing , but now I kind of appreciate the more utility of the A6 those back seats .Let's face it , they're pretty tight back there . And if you're gonna put your friends in there , they probably won't complain . But you should realize that they're not gonna be super happy sitting back there for long periods of time . Where is it ? A A6 . I'll be very happy back there .There's a lot more room in general . I do like the fact that Audi has gone to a much more smartphone based infotainment system . But there is just a lot of technology going on here . And when you do turn these A4 screens off , it's just a sea of black . And this carrots not so bad , because I got this beige leather so it breaks up the black . But the A6 that I was driving earlier had dark and tearing . It was a lot of life .Audi has always had a kind of minimalist design , but that was a little too dark even for me . I do love this real wood you love the way that these seats hold me in a corner transmission have got used to .There's a lot of very thoughtful features in this car , and you're probably wondering what it competes with force .It competes with other cars like this . Mercedes-Benz BMW GT-R out of those , I think the Audi is definitely one that I would choose . I'm talking about A6 versus A5 , Siri's versus E class Mercedes . I think that's a whole different ball game . And that one . Well , that's a different video for other day . You talk about the a silent four door hatchback . Oops , thistles . The one I would choose . I still think it's sexy , is of the bunch , and Audi seems just keep knocking a ball park when it comes to kind of way that car looks and the way that it drives . So let's recap . You've got a whole new generation of Audi , A6 and A7 with more technology where electrons are replacing hydrocarbons . We've got all wheel steering optional . We've got a ton of technology that's very similar to your cell phone , and we've got more power and better fuel economy . What's not to love ? Well , is it too much tech ? You know , I'll have to leave that to you for me . I've always been in early adapter , so I find new technology fascinating , and I think we're seeing just incredible amounts of change in a very short time in the automotive world . And , yes , hydrocarbons and gasoline is on its way out and electricity is on its way in . And you know what ? I think that's a good thing . I hope you do as well as always .

210,286,RS5,"guys , welcome to Phoenix , Arizona and Audi fool me out here to test your hive . That Yes , that's the brand new Audi are S5 . And yesterday I posted a video to TfL now asking for your input . What questions do you want to know about this new Audi ? And you guys came through and asked a lot of great questions . Luckily , Anthony Garbis , the product manager for that car , has become a friend of mine . So coming up right now , we're gonna answer your questions . Yesterday I did a video , and I asked her viewers to submit questions that they were most curious about . The brand new RS5 some that read you the questions . Okay , who's submitted them ? And you know , it sounds good . All right , so first question treats on the streets .Wants to know how does launch control work and how fast we go from 0 to 60 . So , to launch troll in Audi experience the same process across the board . You push the S C button . Once he goes into sport mode , you put a transmission into sports to move the selector lever back down past d on . Then it'll say , sport , you left foot brake on this Cardinal ref about 6500 . And it's an automatic . So just loading the torque converter on , then let go the break . Keep the throttle , Max , and you'll hit 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds . So how does launch control work is very simple . All you do is click the traction control once put it in sport mode , mash the break , mash the throttle Look at all the break Only gonna jump out S60 did you time that ? According Audi , that is exactly 3.7 seconds , which is , uh which is ? Yeah , fast . I got tunnel vision there . You know , this car really is a Mustang with all wheel drive for the road . There's a lot of weight with the engine over the front wheels . There's a lot of power , and there's a lot of attitude with those big oval exhausts . Keep in mind that every RS5 Elin , the Audi lineup now has oval exhausts . All right , this next question is from Roman Micah . Why'd you switch from an eight cylinder to a six turbo ? Sure . So ? So by turbo six . So actually , it's pop this off . This is gonna be a little hot so hot in here , you can see the two turbos and then the catalyst , sitting right behind them as well . Um , it's also heritage , right ? It goes back to original RS4 who's six cylinder and by turbo . And so you also get reduced weight . So it's saved 30 kilograms about £66 from the front axle by going from a six cylinder to bi turbo r kun from eight cylinder by Turbo six . And also now we're making much more torque . About 100 and £26 feet more A4 43 on That's at 1900 rpm . Where before you too revved up 4000 to get into the peak torque curve on the V8 . That's what really gets you going and moving so quickly and why we hit 0 to 60 in only 3.7 seconds . It is the fastest in its class is faster than them for fashion XC60 three and XC60 three S8 .I'm gonna put it in dynamic mode and those baffles open Oh yeah , is interested different tire options on the car And sure you want to know if the's twenties actually ride Ruff Ruff ? Well , any time you go to a lower side wall , you're gonna have a little bit more firmness feeling from the road . Uh , right here , every wheel that you get on ours , models forged . So you have 19 inch wheels , which come with 2 65 with tires on . Those 19 by nine was about 22 a half pounds . These forge 20 inch also 20 by nine , but you gained 10 millimeters of with on the tire CEO to 75 . And then there's also another option where you get milled . Cut forged wheels , which are available on the RS5 and thats dropped about 26 a half pounds . And these air hand cooked right , these tires are hand cooked , like Audi specific hand cooks . We also have a continental , and then a little bit later , we'll have a probably coming in as well . He always have about three tire manufacturers , so you see here where it says so you'll see this on every Audi . It'll be a oh for all the new ones . Some of the older ones Audi for models . They are a one , and these are specific development and compounds and construction of the tires that we work with . Manufacturers to make , and so you can buy a tire that look somewhere this and doesn't have a , oh marking and be a totally different tire . Keep in mind that this Audi has low profile tyres and there's little profile tires go .They give you a lot of grip , which is good for track days , but they also tend to make for a harsh right here in Arizona . Of course , none of the roads are especially bad , so it's hard to judge just how harsh the ride becomes with the low profile tyres . But Audi does say that with this dry , select mode , I can select from basically comfort mode , toe automatic two dynamic to individual mode , and those four different modes dramatically change the character of the car so you can tell the difference between , say , comfort mode and dynamic mode . And let's put it into dynamic mode , which is one where you have the least amount of suspension compliance basically tracked boat changes . The exhaust note changes the way that steering firms up changes .Your shift points car sound like a Formula One car .Things a little bit harsher on the road , but not too bad , and I have to agree that bounty is right about the fact that if I change this woman back to comfort , it completely changes the character of the car . It's much more relaxed . It's much more of a grand tour versus a car that's fit for attracting .Right Wants to know . How does the sound enhancement work ? Sound enhancement ? Eso There's two things in this car . Sport . Exhaust . So it has a different centre sound , sir , which changes the tone . A little bit more of a mechanical sound to the exhaust . And now I'm gonna put it in dynamic mode and those baffles open . Oh yeah , And then on the RS5 under 3000 rpm , there's a diaphragm that sits at the base of fire , will buy the windshield that then takes the engine noise and simply amplifies a little bit to give you some more noise and uses the windshield essentially like a speaker like the windshield speaker . But it's only under 3000 under 3000 . Give the turbo six little bit more grunt , and it's not that we're pumping any sound into the speakers of the car . Anything is just amplifying the engine noise using a diaphragm at the base the windshield . Douglas Milosevski . He wants to know . Why can't I get a manual ? Only A8 V8 automatic . Well , this whole segment Really ? When you look at it is automatic in the performance car segment . R8 R8 A3 GT-R s now on Lee automatic . You get better numbers , you get better acceleration in performance . And when you do it with an automatic and the manual is a little bit of your limitation I mean , I would love a manual , but unfortunately , the minority it's minority of people who would actually buy one . Yeah , I think , um , that's it . Really sure , right ? I mean , it is take read on manual is less than 10% in America , like five . I mean , have a manual on the A4 on A5 coop , and they're they're single digits , and it's just the market's not there for them anymore . People want him , but they don't . So one fact , I like to say because we got a lot with the R8 . Why there's no manual once we truth e s tronic for the R8 , 90% of people are taking the s tronic and 10% taking the manual that's in R8 . So that's kind of set the whole tone for the rest of the segment .Rest of the performance cars , if you would ask me what made her a part of this car is it would have to be the configurable display . Audi does a really great job making a display that not only gives you a map , tachometer , speed and , of course , this is really cool power and torque members moment using 2% of its available power .Let's see what happened in Florida . Oh , yeah , I got 200 I quickly exceed the speed limit .But I do love the fact that all that is right in front of me easily readable , very easy to use when you're on the road and certainly very easy to use when you're on the track . And I think Audi does one of the best jobs in the biz and making a configurable digital display pleasing and yet understandable and user friendly .All right , so M Sears Garage wants to know . Is this more of a G T or more of a sports car ? It leans more towards GT-R than sports car . So if you really want to go like sports car , obviously R8 and also teach us is much more on the R8 side of things , But the whole tour coop A5 family are so this is really a GT , and it's good because it gives you the comfort to be able to drive the car every day that you would want to drive this car every day . Whereas if you're in something that's really just sports , car will beat you up and starts comfortable if something doesn't really fit the the character of this vehicle . All right , Alisa May Marie wants to know . How does the weight compared to an S5 compared to S5 you ? Actually , you gain a little bit of weight on this car from the heavy equipment level that's on it . So they're very well equipped in RS5 . And it's about 100 £100 .Roughly is a sander trunk , so you see a nice slope to it . But then you have a regular trunk here . While the standard trunk may not be very roomy , this car does have folding seats so you can get a 40 60 split by actually folding the seats down , which gives you a lot of room , perhaps even enough room to put a pair of skis in here or a mountain bike if you take the wheels off .And the most interesting question I think , comes from Shahab . He wants to know if we could do it . Walk through the digital data , so let's sure , let's take a look at this . This is the same a virtual cockpit that you'll see in A4 A5 S4 S5 Every time you go up , the models you have made for S4 A5 S5 you get a couple more features to get this sport display most right . So looking at it right here you have the sports played mockery of this central amounted to commoner RS4 . Ours get additional gauges which you can see here on the right . It's ah , the telemetry for the motor . It's a horsepower and torque and then you also have a G meter you can put up . And if you get the dynamic package , which comes with ceramic brakes , you'll get direct tire pressure monitoring and then it will bring up a display that ah tells you individual pressure and temperature of each tire , which is very important because we have this kind of power . You want to know that your tires upto temperature where you start pushing the car and obviously you can configure that it's Blake and show me how so . Um , let's go lay out so you can switch from the sport layout to the classic layout . And this is what you'd expect in a normal car just to pages . So it takes about five seconds or so , and then we'll reload the layout . And then with this , you only have one display in the center that you can show . Okay , so may .Look . We drove , you know , five hours , 23 miles per gallon , which is a respectable for car that puts up a respectable for 44 years and £443 feet of torque . So you have a lot of that's also benefit of the 600 . And I mean , in this segment , it's not as much of a big deal . But we do have class leading fuel economy .All right , so let's say you want , like torque and horsepower and Google Maps on one side and talking horse barn the other . How would you do that ? So if you want to do you have to go back to the sport mode . If you want something other than , like on the Latin right . So in classic , they also have , you know , the typical infant . A motor , I think , with the big map up in the center . Right , son , it's just in the center . You shrink the gauges . If you want to go back to sport mode , you know the layout , you switch it back to sport layout . Second will take five seconds to do the switch over maybe a little less . Okay and said , You can have your maps over here on this side , and it's a little FBI . Yep , give zoom in and zoom out , and then on the right , you can determine what you want on the right side of the layout . By going to additional display , I could use you like dating time consumption , Georgia memory , launch memory or you put the G Meter up and the G meter on your stock will show you the max that you've done in any one of the access . You can kind of just waited too much . They're telling me earlier when the guy's at 1.2 G's of acceleration of 1.2 G's and breaking .So even though we got twenties and even though we have surrounding breaks , this car is still very comfortable long distance cruiser that will eat up miles and get you a ticket like that because , yeah , you will go very quickly from point A to point B in comfort style and in a very green Audi .You like this green color , by the way , it's called no more green on . It is a color that Audi is using . Thio , help highlight you think of this vehicle and it certainly is very unique .Now , a lot of your competitors are actually doing complete virtual buttons , right ? Jaguar just went to that portion of the social . Are you guys gonna go to the milieu to keep the hard buttons ? You see the two screen ? Mm , I set up in the new A8 A7 on . So the new generation of cars have that same set up . So it's It's kind of a thing in the industry now . Yeah , people expect touch screens , right ? It's something they expect from the phones that touch going to make sense . I very much like the end of my knob . But after playing with the new set up for a while in a couple of cars , It's very intuitive , and it's just the next generation that you'd expect . And , uh , you know , this is my softball questions .What's your favorite feature of this car ? My favorite feature of this car I want to call it a feature is just the surge of power you get when you floor this thing in for earlier . And it just goes and hopefully all stayed out of trouble today . I see that , you know , I gotta tell you , um , I kind of thinking about this car was it's kind of if the Germans decided to make an all wheel drive Mustang . This this would be the vehicle that they were banking . Yeah , maybe similar to that . It's a little bit subtle in the amount of performance that it has , but it's got the looks for my favorite features .When you're behind someone on you . See , this wide body on the back of this car looks fantastic , little bit wider than it is here .15 millimeters wider on each fender front and rear , and then your track increased by 11 millimeters in the front 20 millimeters in the rear . That's both from offset of the wheels , and also the hubs are also large and strengthened for the RS5 .And you got not only all wheel drive , but you can route what ? Up to 70% of power . Either forward 80 S8 70 of the front 85 to the rear . And then you have the sport differential which will then transfer Whatever really rear were torque to either the left or right side up 100% you know , Front , back left , right ? Yeah . Eso fearing to turn also with the specific tuning on the RS5 in dynamic mode , it'll let you slide the back out a bit more . It'll overdrive it outside . Well , really push you a bit . Gives you more of a camera . Yeah , and so you have the benefit of dynamics of rear wheel drive and control of all wheel drive . And that is the fastest way around a turn . Right ? When you're out there sliding around drifting , you're not going the fastest way possible .Like the major competitors , right ? The A4 XC60 M3 the M four . This is the only one that has all we'll drive . Correct , correct . So it's also a real Four Seasons car , right ?And of course , the numbers they're important people care about started about 70 right at 69 9 to start . And then , if you learn it all up , another 20 k . The green cards had every option . Yeah , you're about 20 came or S90 que andan , this one sitting at , like 81 what will become available You've seen about another month or so , all right in the spring .And then there's something that you feel about the tire pressure monitors right when you get the ceramic brakes , they also give you the tyre temperature , so its temperature and pressure that's pretty cool . And one thing else didn't note is that we have a spare tire in this car as well . I mean , so spacey . But it's this place here , but it's full . And so like No , no , no . It is not like a kind of hopes and dreams right now . It's a really it's a really wheel , and that's something that we do across the entire A4 G5 Q5 family , and you actually have a separate spare tire . Forget the ceramic brakes because you need them to clear the caliber . So we have two different spare tires and wheels for this car .Now , on these launches , you guys have a lot of different colors you gotta take . It's calm , interesting ones . I'd take a lot of pride in my green cars . Yeah , so tell me about the green and talking about this color . So this Carl , there's Nardo Gray , which is an RS6 color . We've had it for a bit . It's got a great cult following . The RS5 comes into Sonoma Green , which is exclusive to the RS5 , and it's a I love it . It's a gorgeous kind of . It sometimes is a deep green , and then the sun it goes a little bit all of green . It's very it's an awesome color , quite unique . And hey , I think it's polarizing . Know you love it or hate it , but so far I've heard people seem to love it . So hopefully I'll see a lot of green are spies on the road near me . It'll make me happy .Well , there you have it , guys . Thank you for asking some thoughtful and smart questions , and hopefully you got thoughtful and smart answers .

211,287,S4,"ladies and gentlemen , meet the 2018 . That's right . 2018 Audi S4 .It has over 350 horsepower . It has all wheel drive , It has active suspension and it is read What's not to love ?Well , let's find out by taking it for a ride .As always , Full disclaimer , Audi flew me The beautiful Palm Springs on a windy day test drive this new S4 and Audi says it will do 0 to 60 in about 4.4 seconds .So let's see how fast it is .Oh , yeah . Oh , this thing has a whole days . My , my , my mind .It sticks to the wrong like glow a lot of fun . Car . When you get into the booth , really , you're in a canyon carving . This is not a bad tool to use for that particular job breaks .Our linear engine is lusty once more power .Oh , it it gives me more power is a lot of fun to drive fast .Under the hood is a three liter V six Twin Scroll Turbo one Turbo two scrolls . It puts out 354 horsepower and £369 feet of torque .I think most engines air sexy , but unfortunately , manufacturers hide them behind these plastic covers . If you pop to cover , you can actually see the turbo nestled in between the V of the engine . How cool is that ? Now it's insistence . The Quattro It , of course , powers all four wheels 60 40 reared in front power distribution . That's all good .However , it has made it to an eight speed automatic , which is okay , but there is no manual , and there is no dual clutch , which is surprising given that this car costs over $50,000 . If you want a car that can help more people to work and back . But you also Angelo Canyon coming on the weekend . Yeah , this is definitely it .Now Audi says that this car competes with the Mercedes-Benz See 43 a . M . G . And the BMW 3 34 40 I . But if you're a fan of Audi , he's perhaps the only competition is the RS4 . Is that coming ? Well , I asked Audi , and they said , Stay tuned , all right .There are some relatively important issues we need to discuss you and be first and foremost . Steering is heard enough . I have yet to find electric steering that works as well as our old portion 996 There you can actually feel the circumference of the Tyrus changes As you load it up . You can feel the curvature of the road here . It just gets heavier way Do have four drive modes . Suspension keeps his car level of staring . I'm really having a hard time getting out with doing inside the cockpit .It's all business , and what I mean by business is the business of driving on the autobahn . This is a very sporty and driver centric interior .Everything is leather and I think full aluminum .But you've got a big , fat , flat bottom steering wheel . You , of course , have Audi . Is Google Maps on the navigation ?It's very modern . It's very Tuckey , and it's very comfortable .So , as always , I'm sitting behind myself . Mind about 62 Yeah , you know , I've got some headroom . I've got some leg room , but really , the driver's seat is where you want to be . If you want something that's comfortable in the back , I suggest you look at a six or maybe even an S8 thing .Just hold on for dear life and of course , part of that are the tires , and the other part of that is the active suspension combined with all wheel drive . Normally , it's a 40 60 blip , which means that most of the power's going to the back of the 60% of it , and that gives this car very neutral .On center feels I car these quarters if you're interested in this 2018 Audi S4 there to dealerships . Right now , pricing starts at about $51,000 . And if you get all the tech , all the bells and whistles , that goes up to about $60,000 .If you're interested in fuel economy , your best is , of course , gonna be on the highway 30 mpg .Now why's his car was designed after the diamond of the Sodi guy who designed that told us the front end is more sculpted , more rugged . Maur manly , I guess , more masculine lot of weights . But if you want the one that's even a step above one , that is according to how you live more emotionally , you have to go for the S5 , and I will be doing a complete review of S5 as well .So you compare two door four door very similar in almost every aspect , of course , except for the styling and the fact that this has four doors .S5 has to stay tuned for that , and I noticed you can really hear the engine note .Is that realism through speakers ? How do you guys do that ? So there's a couple ways . One . There's actuators on the exhausted open flaps Exhaust . That's cool . Yeah , yeah , that's real . You don't want to get drone when your cruise around town is you keep the flops close because you've got four exhausted way A4 exhausted . So there's a actuator that closes the driver's side rear muffler and then one on the outboard exhaustive of the passenger side . You can do one exhaust open to exhaust opened or all four , depending on how it needs to know . You see , the more you open the locker against yes , and then on the intake on the engine .At the back , there's a sound actor which takes , emphasizes the motor noise and uses it as the windshield is like a soundboard . Okay , you're resonating the windshield intensity . You're resonating actual engine noise up through the windshield . I can see that you're not actually playing . We don't play anything through the speakers are No , it's not what we're pumping in . It is just emphasizing , and you can adjust the sounds of that to Dr Select . If you like that , don't turn up .Yeah , A4 doors . There is , of course , the brand new 2018 Audi S5 . And that review is coming up next on the fast lane car . So be sure to stay tuned for that .

212,288,S3,"ladies and gentlemen , once upon a time , a sign of success was having a big house in a big car . But today , premium and large don't have to go together . You can have a tiny house and be very successful . Or you could have a small car introducing the brand new 2017 Audi S3 and coming up right now , we're gonna review it , and we're gonna find out just what makes this car so fast and so fun .All right , let's give this a try . Oh , yeah , Look at that . Under the hood is a direct injected to leader that puts out 292 horsepower and £280 foot of torque . It powers , of course , all four wheels via Audi ease Quattro system , and it , compared via a six speed dual clutch automatic transmission off this power train seems familiar to you . It's because the same power train that's in the Volkswagen Golf R8 except in the Audi , you can only get it in the automatic dual clutch for 2017 the Audi A3 .And in this case , of course , the S tree have been refreshed . Their new Z on headlights , new led tail lights anew .More purposeful , meaner grill . But press . Most importantly , it still looks like a baby A4 or a Mini Me A8 .All right , let's get this disclaimer out of the way . First Audi flew me here to Durham , North Carolina , to test drive this car , and it is a lovely city , and I'm actually very familiar with the A3 platform , and this is a refreshed version of that .What we're looking at 292 horsepower and S60 dual clutch transmission with a turbo that's pulls up like that . That's what makes this car such a hoot to drive .Of course , the A3 is , well , a mini version of the A4 or a Mini Me version of the A8 . So if you love small cars , if you love premium small cars , this is actually a really good choice .What does Car compete with obviously kind of slots and below on M to compete with the AMG Mercedes ? So it's kind of it's own thing , right ?He's got his own thing , and it's a nice in between for someone who wants more power than in A3 wants to say in a smaller vehicle . But you know , you're getting near performance levels of in S4 as well .In here , you'd be hard pressed to find a classy or more stylish and more sporty interior than this . Audi S three's , especially with thes optional sport seats , really hug you in this flat bottom steering wheel , which is becoming a bit of a cliche , cause I reviewed it in a Nissan rogue of all places really does belong in this car . I love sitting in the front of this car . It's a great place to spend time , but I don't like Well , let me show you .Yeah , that's no good . I don't like the backseat . There's no headroom . There's not much leg room . And perhaps that's a sacrifice that you do have to make when you go tiny . Except in this case , of course , if you own the car , that sacrifice , maybe for the person who's stuck in the penalty box back here .So you're going to see Virtual Cockpit is new to the A3 family for Molly or 17 and on the S Models , you'll see a little bit different , which we have here , which is called our sport mode .So it gives you the central amounted to commoner and then you can customize what you put on the left and what you show on the right . So I want to look on the left . I can have it . Show me my fuel consumption , Short term or long term memory . I like always having my date . And then if you see in the bottom , you have a boost gauge , which might There you go . And then on the left , over here will tell your oil temperature as well . But this is a great setting to be able to show . Okay , I have my car settings , my playback for my media or radios here . If you pair your phone , you can scroll through and make calls . Everything done at your fingertips so you don't take your hands off the wheel . And then also , a lot of people use that as your map . We're gonna have a navigation year , or you can switch to the mode and you have a full map mode as well .All right , I've got the important numbers right here . 21 city , 20th Highway 24 .Come bind . It starts at 42,900 . But when you add things like this 500E $75 metallic white glacier paint the big wheels , the sport seats . You end up with the ass tested price of 51,000 , 300 and 20 .Look at that . I'm going way too fast on this side road with a huge smile on my face . Now , Audi says that it will do 0 to 60 in about 4.7 seconds . We'll have to test that in Colorado to see if it's true . But , uh , yeah , it feels like a five second car . Does that sound good ? Well , it's a four banger Turbo . I do like kind of that wish of the way skate when it is a full throttle . But from the outside , it's not exactly hellcats .You don't have to go and you spend a lot of money to get a lot of car you don't need . It s a sometimes maybe half the cylinders and half the price doesn't necessarily need half the fun or have the luxury . You can have your cake . And with this s three , you can eat it too .The S three get specific cuatro software , which is what something that we use in the T t and T . T s also so now in Audi Dr Select , which is standard on every S three . You have the ability to adjust essentially your torque split front to rear . So when you put in dynamic mode , you have more of your torque by default going to the back of the car . And they sent also help with , you know , turn in a little more fun to drive factor . And when you get into an overseer situation , the power to the rear usually would be reduced to keep the car in control . Uh , control , But people more in line with what you'd expect it to happen in dynamic mode . It'll let you have little bit more fun with the back of a car . Won't reduce power in overseers situations with these magnetic shock absorbers , which are optional , by the way , does change kind of the ride makes it a lot more . It makes it a lot more stable at high speeds . Keeps the car nice and flat in turns by Subaru .Yeah , yeah , I do miss the stick shift . You can't get that in the stick shift . If you didn't want the stick shift , Probably the best solution to that would be to get the golf R , which is basically the same drive , train and chassis .But if you want the four rings of Audi and you want kind of a panache and the upper quality of materials that you get with a top of the line out , you're gonna have to go with the Audi . But you are going to sacrifice the fact that you can't get a manual transmission . But you know , I don't mind that this six speed dual clutch is just really phenomenal in pairs .Very nicely indeed , with this two litre turbo on , it is amazing that you could get so much power out of a small engine , quite extraordinary , that any speed , there's just a hint of turbo lag and boom , You're into the turbo and you're into the booth and the car takes off like a scalded cat steering .Well , it's electric . You know what I feel about that ? It gets heavier as a car speeds up . It gets lighter as it slows down , just like tiny houses .Sometimes good things come in small packages , and it is certainly the case of the Audi S A3 . Now , keep in mind if you're looking for an M two competitors , the Audi with 100 horsepower more is coming next year . This car , of course , is available at your local dealership right now .

213,289,"A6, S6, S7","it's called a mid cycle refresh , basically , when a manufacturer changes up a car in the mid part of its life with a new front grille , new engine output and that is exactly what Audi has done with the A6 , the S6 and , of course , the S7 . So let's start with the A6 . Take it for a ride and see how Audi has changed up the car .Yeah , theme . Big news is under the hood . For 2016 you get a revised , direct injected turbo charged to leader that now puts out 252 horsepower and £273 foot of torque for combined mpg of 26 . If you go for the front wheel drive model , you also delete the old CVT , and instead you get a dual clutch on the A model's .We've added Trap is a little integrated tailpipes , which gives it a more luxurious look .This engine is the most fuel efficient in the lineup . Audi is very proud of the fact that they've created a very fuel efficient to leader is a powerful , you know , it is powerful , actually surprisingly powerful . I was afraid that we were gonna get is a car that has great mpg is but not huge amounts of torque .So what's different on the A6 for 2016 while their new led tail lights and perhaps the most important differences right here in the grill ?If you look they've cleaned up , these led . He's making a little bit more modern . It's also more chrome , and there's a bit more angular Maur . I mean , look to the car . So the A6 for 2016 model years a product improvement . So we have design changes on the exterior new led lighting . Some changes to the gro makes the car a little bit more dynamic looking a little wider stance were also a little bit more . Not necessarily more chrome , but just a different shape to the are single frame grill and a little bit of of a wider splitter in the front so it makes the car just gives it a wider , more dynamic stents for 2016 . There's also dual pane glass all around , which makes for a much quieter cabin , and inside there knew what Audi calls design selections . In essence , this wood comes in different colors . Audi has always been class leading when it came to interior design , and that has not changed in 2016 A6 .Yeah , it's good . You know , a combination of dual transmission and turkey turbo really gives it a sense of top . So what's not to like ? But a fuel economy ? More horsepower , greater torque , even more angular .And let's call it more sophisticated styling .We also have improved engines on every single one . So we have an all new 2.0 leader four cylinder engine with 252 horsepower that , frankly , we just drove up the canyon the other day and uphill and the car sounded great , had great acceleration and never quit on on that , with all of the torque that canyon brakes , feel confident lets you in return is like it's good .These are the fattest tyres .One of the things that Audi does not do is enhance engine notes . What you're hearing is actually the engine they do noise cancellation . Basically , they changed the engine note so that it's not harsh by cancelling some of the more harsh sideways , but they don't change it in terms of actually piping in the sound of the engines . What you're hearing is a car which is cool . Respect Audi .Yeah , it really is very possible .And there's always a compromise between harshness and possibility , right ? So you really want to place the car within a millimeter of where it should be ? You need , uh , stiffer suspension , wider tyres that you want a car that's comfortable in the long haul . You need the exact opposite . This car seems to get compromised that Yeah .Overall , Audi has tightened up the package , but we'll have to wait till we get to Colorado for complete review , because spending a few minutes with the car is not fair to you . And it's not fair to Audi . As always , this is Roman reporting for the fast lane car . Check out TfL car dot com for more news use and , of course , real world reviews . And remember , subscribe for a new car video every day .Just a quick note . In case you're curious , I have driven both this and the S6 , and this is a lot more compliant . It's a lot . What is a relative term ? Let's say , out of a scale of 1 to 10 it's five degrees softer , so suspension does a better job of soaking up the bumps . It's not quite a sharp in terms of handling . The brakes aren't quite as grabby or is powerful , but for a car that is basically designed to be luxurious four door family sedan , it can be very sporting when you decide Thio light up the afterburners . My afterburners . I mean trouble .It's possible . It's comfortable . It's fun to drive .It smells good . What more could you want out of a luxurious family sedan ?"
214,290,Q5,"just a short little story . Tell me a story . I was in Germany a few years ago at the launch press launch of the new Volkswagen Touareg . Okay , Twi rag is already say on , uh , they they have different waves . Come in . American journalist , European journalists now is obviously an American waste .I got to drive the hybrid and I got to drive the diesel . Just six cylinder , huh ? And then I accidentally got into this to rack and I floored it and it pushed my face back like this . It was like , Oh , my God , what the heck is that ? And I did not know this , but in Europe to get in V8 cylinder . That's right , They do . They get all the good stuff in Europe . Don't A8 cylinder diesel . And the amount of torque that thing produced was greater than like an American Dooley . And that's where I became sold on diesels and torque forces gassing horsepower . The horsepower is important . Have speed , of course . V8 Hemi sound . All that is great , but there's nothing like a lot of corn .Audi has proportionately blown away . Everybody has come near them when it comes to racing with their diesel diesel engines . They have been absolutely bulletproof and phenomenal and unbeatable . It . It has to do with range , and it has to do with Torque and Heston . But the fact that diesel engines seem like to me that they're far more reliable and long lasting than the gas equivalent . Let's face it , Audi has doubled down on diesels , right ? They certainly have . And what we get him right now average 30 miles per gallon right now , 30 miles . You're driving like a schmuck . Inter fighting like I stole it .There can be no doubt that this is an Audi . You've got the classic big grille .And of course , if the headlights around you would see these cool led ZN , Audi is probably the best in terms of doing led bling on cars . And they changed it quite often , which makes it very obvious and very relevant when you're driving last year's model because , well , the front headlights around change . I think that's brilliant , Nathan , because it gives people a reason to buy new Audi .How about the back of the car on the back of the car ? Once again , Audi tasteful . They just have a way of styling cars That's just never overwrought right ? And frankly speaking , this deserves , Oh , a slap because it's beautiful and , you know , with Audi White is definitely the new black .This is a fantastic engine . Check this out . This V six TV I puts out 240 horsepower , but more importantly , £428 feet of torque . It's fed to a eight speed automatic transmission , and it's a three litre . Now here's a question for anything . What is the last three leader Turbo diesel that we tested ? Oh , the Ram , The Ram . That's right . It's got the same . And how many poem for the torture that have 420 ? So this actually has eight more . This should be fast . It should be a rocket . Get everything you want out of your SUV crossover with very little lust .Yes , diesels more expensive .But the payoff is you get so much torque , you're actually getting a benefit . Yeah , I mean , A4 right now a little bit of terrible leg . Then it's linear , and it just pushes you back harder and harder and more and more just effortless power . You just feel like at any moment you could pass the car next to you in case there's an opening in traffic . You can well pull a horse trailer if you had to . And you could do it all in style and comfort .That's the thing about these cars , man .You don't You don't hear . I know . Well , I hear the radio . Yeah , your high school music . Well , you know , she's standing up . I told you , it's a little competition . When am I ?But you know what ? You can't hear Torque . You can feel it . So let's take it to 60 and you can really feel the power . You won't hear it . 128 feet of torque thing is a little vehicle . It's really not that big . No , it's not . And it's got so much torque that it will pull your face off .I love it , but it is expensive . $51,000 . A lot of money .It is a lot of money , and you don't get like cool seats . I know you don't . I mean , that should be standard . At least call my button such a hot car .Right ? But you do get this really nice panoramic sunroof . Open it up , don't you ? Oh , yeah . Cool . Camera coming down way back .Yeah , The size of this thing takes up most of the car . One of the biggest ones have seen that in my mind .Audi to some of the best interiors in class . But having said that , this interior started feel just a little bit dated . The screen feels a little bit too small .How days ? Mm I ? Well , it's getting better , but it's still a little too convoluted .Having said that , I can tell you that everything feels expensive . All the materials are nice to the touch . And you know what ? Even an older , aging Audi interior . I think it's still better than a lot of the manufacturers brand new interiors .Now this car does compete in a very crowded market segment . Paris like the air X3 50 Lexus ? Yeah , Alexis . That's right . BMW , of course . X3 Mercedes-Benz Geo Cadillac SRX . Yeah , okay , way to go out of town . There's a lot of cars that go for this audience and fired , and I think this one , in my mind is my favorite drives .Not quite like the sports car , but certainly sporty . You can really feel what the wheels are doing . There's a great sense of comfort in at the same time it's in . That kind of German autobahn weighs 40 that it feels like if you want a flogging around the canyon , it would be happy to dance with you . I call it the Chanel diesel and wait on . The steering is ideal , especially for a crossover and the seating positions .Excellent seats are very comfortable .It has 19 inch wheels with scorpion son , right ?Yeah , the scorpions or mud and snow , and they still have relatively good grip . So , yeah , a little bit of scrub . But I came another corner . Well , cause I could be the rear and pushing you around corners , which is something you're not gonna feel a lot of sorry competition against . Get it out because Roman's driving like an idiot . Nine . Terrified .I agree with Roman . This is a fantastic interior .With that said , the back seat is a little tight , so I'm sitting behind myself and frankly , losing a little bit of knee room . So it's a little tight . Also , my feet kind of gets stuck underneath the seat just a little bit .Even no one cares . Getting too drunk , they care . You check out the trunk , though this is amazing .Big enough for almost three maidens .Now that's trunk space . Wants me to shut it . I'm shutting it .What is this , Michael ? Like a bug ? That's not much of a curse , Nathan . There's something You're from back here , and that's what the seats up . Yeah , it's really impressive .And I love the fact that everything here feels so nice because he always locking in the trunks for so long , actually comfortable for a human being .Look at me . Oh , look at that .All right . 0 to 60 in the Audi Q5 with the diesel . Now , we are in a mile above sea level . As always . I've got the air conditioner off . I've got in sport mode . I do have panel shifters , but I'm not going to use them because they tend to be slower than the car can shift itself . So here we go . Here goes , Oh , there goes the power . And here comes 60 right there . Look at that . Look at that . Least , gentlemen , that is crazy Fast . 7.18 seconds to 60 . And if you weren't sea level , you could easily subtract a second from that . So you'd be at about 6.18 Holding cares nicely like this needs to be transmission once again in sport mode . So here we go . One more time with the camera between ing Let the commoner go faster for that to reset . Given a little break . Torque .Uh , pap those gears . 50 and 60 right there . Oh , identical . That is unusual To get exact . Same time . 7.18 Well , no launch control needed . 7.18 is what this car got . Nathan . Bet me seven and 1/2 . He was close , but I went all faster .So on the TfL , scaled by at least a resident database . And I have no doubt this is a buy it because of the power and the fuel economy .I absolutely agree , folks . The time has come . More vehicles should have a diesel engine . Especially one like this . Torque gas mileage . Good power . Speed . Quiet . It's a fantastic power plant .I say hi as always , this Roman and even saying Thanks for watching . Remember , stay tuned after the close for a very special announcement coming up this weekend . See you next time on the fast thinker .Nathan , why don't you tell him what we're covering this weekend . We're going to Austin . The cover Formula One ? Yes , the first time ever . The first T R L Formula One coverage from the race Track of the Americas . Right . That's right . Circuit of the Americas circuit of the Americas . Well , I've got tickets . I've got tickets to the tickets . No , I don't . The tickets . You know the tickets . Kyle , do the tickets . No , Andre had the tickets . Andre , the tickets . You're joking . Duties already on a plane ? You mean Andres ? Covering this going ? Adre Hearse you , Andre ?"
215,291,A8,"Now , of course , this car is a bridge between today's latest technology and oncoming and incoming autonomous cars . Because , let's face it , autonomous cars were coming . So I'm sitting here basically driving this car with cruise control on with my hands and my feet off the pedal and off of the wheel . Now the car is telling that he put my hands back on the wheel because , well , I kept him off too long .Ladies and gentlemen , meet the brand new 2019 Audi A8 long . That's right . It's the long version . The only way we're gonna get in America and this car will pamper you . It will walk gentle smells of spring or winter into the cabin . It will massage your feet . It will massage your back and off receipts and home hopes drive itself and coming up right now , we're gonna do a very deep dive into all that technology and show you how it almost drives itself . And most importantly , I'll tell you whether it's better than the BMW seven series and Mercedes-Benz s class .All right , let's start with what's under the hood because , well , it may not be the most interesting part of the car It's certainly what makes it go . So you're expecting a V8 . It's a three liter turbocharged V six . It puts out 335I horsepower 369 confident torque .It has made it to an eight speed automatic transmission , and perhaps most interestingly , it is a 48 volt mild hybrid because this bad boy needs a lot of power , all the tech that's built and baked into it .One of the things that I don't love about this car , these kind of fake exhaust tips because the real exhaust or hiding yep , down there . So even though it looks like an exhaust , it's not .Audi says this move A8 A8 with the turbo instead of Super Charger will do 0 to 60 and 5.6 seconds . Now . I would be remiss if I didn't test that out . Let you guys see if that is indeed the case . I've been a completely empty parking lot by myself , so let's put it in dynamic mode , which it is . Yep , let's just put it in drive . Looking over the sport , you know that means manual shifting . Emily at this car ship for itself , bring torque it a little bit . And here we go . You tell me how long this is S60 . Hopefully your time that and it felt pretty fast . Initially , there was this rush of torque and then toward the end , it kind of dissipated a little bit . But I'm thinking this is a six second car . We are at sea level . We'll do some proper testing once we get it back in Colorado . But , uh , yeah , I think it's a six second car .Full disclosure . That's right . Audi flew me out here to beautiful Big Sur , California . Put me up in a grand hotel and let me enjoy a beautiful California sunset .Audi has created a very bespoke experience in the new , eh ? What is this Spoke mean ? It just means unique and custom . Basically , there are seven different profiles that you can choose from that customized 400 different features of the car . Everything from what kind of besides you want how you want your temperature settings to where you want your seat , where you want your steering wheel , the normal stuff . Plus , of course , all the things that you could do with a car with air suspension so you can have different Dr Select from comfort to dynamic the sport and the newest feature . That's very akin to if you know Mercedes-Benz class are electric doors so unheard open door . All you have to do is just gently upon the handle and the door opens . Who , of course , to close it , just gently close it in the door . Does the rest of the work perhaps the coolest feature of this Audi are these events that now close and open kind of has a way of greeting you when you walk into the car incredibly silent and they're incredibly cool ? And you may be thinking to yourself , You know , the Jaguar accepted that a long time ago , and I suspect the guys that Audi would tell you that the Volkswagen fate on did it even before the Jaguar . But it is a cool party . Trick and event not only kind of reclines into the dashboard , but the piece of wood then closes to give you one giant and , I think very elegant , beautiful bit of wood . One of my favorite features is , of course , Google Earth . And check this out . Of course , you can zoom in , or if you want , you can zoom out . I can show you actually where we are right there . There's the Pacific and there's PCH won the Pacific Coast Highway . They're not one , not two . But now , in fact , three different screens that air customizable that do everything from control how the seats missiles you to Senate air coming into the cabin too . Of course , your music , your navigation And , of course , a lot of other features . So let me have Anthony tell you and show you what thes three different screens can actually accomplish . So it's pretty configurable , right ? You've got this screen you can configure so you can put you could put for instance , you're right Now you've got your speedometer , and your rpm's very small , but you can make a bigger right , Sure , and so you can set it up . But if you want the you don't need If you're around home , you don't want your map up there or you you'd rather have your your media playing your radio . You can have the large gauges that you're used to on dhe . You know , out here you could put your map if you wanted to just have an idea where you are and you can , you know , we've brought with this new generation , the gesture control , just like you'd expect from a tablet on . Then if you decide all , I'd rather have my radio stations here in the center on and the math over here , you can reverse it . So it's really set up that you can set the car up the way you like it . And now with the new generation of A8 , we have profiles so that when you get in the car , the the car will ask , Is Anthony my car ? I'm gonna get in . It's gonna say , driver profile , Anthony , Is this you ? If it's not , you can scroll down , right when you get in the car goes the next profile , and then it will set up to 400 different settings within the car . So when I get out of the car when I'm done today , it's gonna memorize . That's the way Anthony wanted the car set up . And next time I get in , if my wife had the car and she had a different profile , When I get in , I can switch it to Anthony . The car just changes all around . It changes the presets and the shortcuts that you have the icons that the way . It's all set up here in the M M I . The ambient lighting color , the temperature , the driver , assistant settings , everything . And these are the types of things . As you drive the car , you will set this up and I'm set it and forget it . And then and it can all come back to the way you like it if someone else is driving or if you share a car . So the profiles are a really powerful way of , of kind of customizing and making a car familiar to you . Every time you get it , you can set it up in your profile that you get a fragrance you have winter or summer fragments of the car smells good when you get out of there with one of the friends of the fragrances air in here in the H faxes system . Here , you you have him on there's a nine isar a cz wells . The fragrance it's that's in here , and you can set which fragrance you want with Winter summer and how subtle we haven't set on light . Just it's something . It's really a preference , and we didn't want it to be too strong . You're smart phone When you put your finger over it , it's gonna execute that command based on the heat There , I can see I'm driving along . I want to make a phone call . I'm focused on the road to put my finger here . All I see orange in my proof revision I want I know phone is green . I wanted the phones and I put my finger , I see the green and then I give it a push . And so that way you'll have the deliberate command executed , not the one that your finger went to first . So , you know , touch screens have been around for a little while , but most of them , when you put your finger over him , it's gonna execute that . And then and then you can add frustration because you're driving . We want you focused on the road and I put my finger in between . Phone is on so I can push that . So that's literally away toe . Take some of the stress out of the driving , takes on the cognitive load off and make it a bit more intuitive . And just like the previous A8 , we've got this fixed place for your wrist so that you can control everything before we had 35 buttons . Now we've gotten rid of the only time . I don't need to write anything here right now . Why would we ? Right , You're not just for fun while I want to put a navigation destination , and now I'm gonna put this in . Now it transforms to , ah , writing pad on me , and you get some tips in here . The first time is a brand new car . So it gives you these tips , Um , and then down below , we have natural handwriting recognition . In the past , you had to write block letters . Now you can write left to right or right on top , So Okay , well , look for Starbucks . Um , that's the one that everyone loves to look for . And then it has . Now , we're going to a cloud to do the points of interest . And if I don't want Starbucks now very easily , you just scroll and get rid of that . Or if I'd rather put it in with the keyboard , just touching the corner . Starbucks . You can also , um , right directly on top handwriting so I can do just right on top . Still find it left . Right ? So it's really a big upgrade . in the in the way you can interact with the car .There's some buttons here that aren't hard wired , but they're up here because of the ones that you most commonly used least according what Audi thinks you must come in . Stop , start . I could turn off . I can also turn awfully departure . I could get this close , the screen in the back privacy screen . I can open it . Actually , I can turn off display on top here and why do you turn off the display ? But this was wonderful , giant kind of sweeping of just piano black .That's a lot of ways very elegant , or if I want to know where I'm going to turn it back on , Audi says this car is basically Level two economy . But you know , as I'm driving or not driving along here because we want , I get the feeling that there isn't much that would keep this car from being fully autonomous , kind of pink talking off the side of the lane lines . But for the most part , I've got my foot off the brake . I've got my hands off the wheel , and this car is driving itself a least for a little bit maybe wondering how long will do that before television with my hands back on the wheel and Audi says it really depends on speed of the car . It's rain . What's in front of you . So there's no amount of seconds . For instance , you might be thinking about 10 seconds . Get your hands back . No , there's really no time . It just depends on the conditions .You know , style is a very subjective thing . I think we can all agree that some cars are just butt ugly . I'm talking about the Pontiac ass . Heck , and perhaps some cars . Air just dropped that . Gorgeous . Maybe the new Range Rover Ovelar . Now , to me , the Audi , at least from the front , is classic Audi . Look at the nose . It's intersecting lines , a lot of angles . It's very sharp , very modern , but we move on to the back . Things changed quite a bit . It almost feels like two different designers did the front in the back of the car . Because back here , no more intersecting lines . It's around , not angular . It sort of looks like well , it sort of looks like a Lincoln Continental from the back .Normally at this point in the review I talk about backseat room and of course , there's plenty of head room .But best of all , I've got a lot of control over my backseat environment . In fact , I've got so much control that well , let me look the Audi product manager demonstrate , because in the four hours I've had in this car , I have not been able to learn off of the functions that are baked into the back seat s o . Of course , the backseats important in any large luxury sedan . Front seat back . See , One of the great things we have in this is we have what we have for the U . S . Is the receipt comfort package where you got the individual reroute board seats . It's a five seater version , but when you put the center console down , you get a lot of controls in here so you can recline the seats a bit . You've got lumbar on , and then we also have what we brought with this generation . A8 is ah , rear seat remote that is integrated into the head unit of the car and all the electronics and basically this remote controls the seats , the lights , blinds , radio , media and also some of the sightings in the car as well as the H back for the back . And the nice thing about this is nuts set in the center console . If you wanted to put that up , you just take it out on your hand . You can d'oh interesting things like adjust your seat heating . You get a massage in this . So we've got different massage programs in here . You get a wave ? When we were driving up to this today , we put it on . I like to use the activation . Kind of wakes you up a bit while you're driving , and you can set the different intensity of this that you can do . So there I have the right , um , seat down . And if I wanted to change to left here , we'll give you the relax ation massage , and you can sit in the back . The massage . We had this in the previous generation , but with the new generate , we had 10 massage nodes in the front in the rear previous generation . Now we have 16 in the front 18 in the back , so 60 to 80% Maur massage with two more programs in there . So even higher level of luxury and kind of . Well , Mr while you're while you're driving the car , you close this using that control is this somewhere else ? That is part that's always in your car . On the the door , Some of the other interesting features back here on the remote . You can control the lights , the interior lighting and one of the interesting , um , features we have in the back seat . We saw these matrix reading lights . Normally , you get in a car and reading light is just push you on and off of a button . And it's just pointed out , and you have to move your book or your magazine that you're reading in the back seat . You have to move it to where the light is pointing well with the With this new generation , we've created the , um , the matrix , rear reading lights and what you can do back here . Did you go in the individual and you can set the different size of a light ? It'll give you the spotlight on the remote . You can move the light around where you want , so you better where you're basically what's happening because I'm doing the left side . You're nice idea . So basically what's happening up there is . This is the same philosophies are front matrix beam headlights . There are no motors moving . We have seven different nodes of of led light back here . And as you move the light around where you want it to be on the remote , different lights light up because each of those different nodes in the headliner has a different brightness , and it's aimed a different place as interesting a book here I could I could bet on my hand I could move it over here , basically pointed to wherever it is that that's the same as the headlights .Yeah , that's the same way we use the matrix beam headlights in order . If there's an oncoming car , we can light up around that car , but not blind . The driver coming the other way if you have matrix being headlights in your car .So I noticed we have heated and cooled seats , just like all four seats . You've got heating , massage , lumbar , um , all four seats all the way around . I think they ventilation . Replying to in the back . They do recline that most of that is done with thes center hardy hard buttons . You can also control the front seat from the rear . That's cool . So you're one more leg room ? Yeah , you could move that forward . You have a ski pass through ? Yep . If you want to go skiing , you can . I put my snowboard ? I bought a snowboard this weekend and put it through there already . So I've already done it with my , uh , look like these controls . They're pretty cool . Yeah . So what ? That's one of the features of the design philosophy of this sophistication and simplicity they're bringing instead of buttons . You have these sliders , and that's how you open and close those that it's echoed throughout the interior of the new A .You may be wondering how much all this tech cost . Well , it starts in about $84,000 if you take the right boxes and get all of the bells and whistles , you can get up to about 110,000 on average . This car is probably gonna be about a $90,000 car , which , for a car that's built on the same platform as its cousin , the Bentley and features a lot of the same technology , is either a bargain or a very expensive Audi depending on how you look at it , you may be wondering , How does this car drive on ?The answer is like you would expect . It's not the most powerful of these vehicles . There are bigger engines coming right now . We just have that turbocharged V six . So there is a sense of power . It's just not unlimited power , so you don't have the sense of like the world is warping around you and you're getting television . It's fast , but not take your breath away fast . Let's face it , 48 volt system is , of course , the wave of the future , because there's just so much technology here that needs to be powered .So that only do I have a camera up here , which is looking for the lane . Lines actually also have the first production laser in a car , which is mounted in the grill of the car , which also lets the car sense its environment . And I have the usual suite of ultrasonic sensors , which are checking to see if I'm about to hit something and all that needs to be powered .So the mild 48 volt system it allows this car to not only turn the engine off , and Audi says that it actually turns it off below 15 miles an hour . So when you're coming to a stop , not only will turn off at a stop , it will turn out well before the stop . And then , of course , it allows it to keep all this stuff running while the engine is not running .So if you're looking for something to go , Carbon Canyon's this car will do it , but it won't be happy doing it . It won't be sad , but it's not exactly designed .For now , One of the things that makes it much more nimble than it should be is the fact that it has dynamic rear wheel steering . So not only do the front wheel steer , but the back wheel steer is well , and that has to benefits first and foremost . When you're on a curvy road , it allows the car thio more accurately carve a corner because the rear wheels are also steering . And , of course , perhaps that the biggest and most noticeable difference between a regular front wheel steer car , all wheel steer cars that gives you much tighter turning radius . In fact , Audi says that this has the exact same turning radius oven Audi A4 , which is saying a lot because Audi A4 is but smaller than this . This is by all definitions of very large car .Let's keep in mind that the Audi A8 A8 l of the long version is only one that's coming to America , so you won't be able to actually buy the short version of this vehicle . But right now , if you want the ultimate Audi , this is the one that you have to go for . This is the only choice on . I have to say that as a fan of German luxury cars between the Audi , the BMW and the Mercedes , I would choose the Audi go back to what I said when I started this . And that is that when this first came out , it was kind of a a silver bullet of technology that brought all wheel drive into a segment that was dominated by sportiness , which would , of course , be BMW and by luxury , which be the Mercedes on this car has kind of an understated elegance about it that is bespoke . But yet that I spoke to the point that people out there might consider you to be , well , just a little too wealthy for your old unit . You know that now . He started this review by asking a very straight forward question . Is this new A8 as good as a Mercedes-Benz as class or a BMW seven series ? And , of course , the classic answer would be if you want the most luxurious one . If the Mercedes do you want the sportiest one . Get the BMW . But if you want an elegant and understated combination of both with all wheel drive , especially if you have been a place like Colorado than heck Air , get this new Audi A8 has always Roman reporting for the fast lane car .

216,292,A5,"back in 2010 Audi did something unusual by introducing the A A7 . They took the utility of a sedan and , of course , kind of the sexiness of a coupe and the utility of a hatchback and mash it up into one car . Well , now we're here with this , the a A5 sport back , which is basically the same concept . But you know what ? Let me show you through the magic of video . So is it a coupe ? Is it a sedan or is it a hatchback ? Well , it's actually all three .It's a car that has the lines of a coupe .It's a car that has utility of a sedan , yet it has the functionality on the room of a hatchback . I mean , you could easily put your bike back here and coming up right now . Let's take it for a quick drive around , well , beautiful Washington , near Seattle , and see just what Audi is built with this new A5 sport back , here's what really makes this Audi A5 sport back special .It's of course , this profile .Think of this as an A4 mashed up with an A5 , but with four doors and , of course , a hatchback .It is lower than A4 . And , of course , it is a lot sexier than both in A4 and A5 . At least from my point of view . Of course , this is basically an A4 with a much sexier body placed on top of it .But because you have four doors and you have a sport back , thes front doors are relatively short .So normally in a coupe de A5 , you have these long doors , which make for easier ingress , basically getting it out of the car easier with this car because you have four doors . They're relatively short , little trickier to get in and out .But let's find out just how fast it is . So , um , the florid and then you guys decide how long this takes their 60 . Audi says that you take about 5.7 seconds and I have to agree with them way Get the car back to Colorado Will , of course , take it on our test track and do some proper testing . Under the hood of the A5 Sport Back is the same power train that you'll find in the A4 . This is a turbo charged four cylinder that puts out 252 horsepower and £273 foot of torque .It is made it , in this case to a seven speed double clutch automatic with panels . If there is the powers , of course . All four wheels Very .What's your title ? Bad director ? Product planning , Audi America . So you're the guy who knows what all the cars are that are coming down the pike , right ? Sure , yeah , But you won't talk about future products . Well , let's talk about the product that weren't so , First of all , obvious question . Why do we need another variation of the A5 ? Well , uh , looking at the success that the A7 has had when we were introduced A7 into our C segment , which is a six BMW A5 . Siri's Mercedes E class tripled our sales in the sea segment . Bring that car and we increased sales , and we're hoping to do the same with the with the A5 sport .So , of course , the downside to having the lower and sexier roof is that well , it's a little hard to get in out of .It's the same chance he basically is an A4 . So let me get in the back and see how much room I have when I'm actually sitting in the back of the car instead of the front of the car . Now I'm sitting behind myself , as always , and I'm 62 so I had to crane my neck a little bit to get back here . But it's not too bad . And if you look , I've got Okay , any room I've got ? Okay . Head room . You know , it's not a place I want to take a road trip . But sitting in the back of this car is more comfortable than you would think with a car with a roof line .This low 27 mpg combined , which is in a rather remarkable for car that's capable of 0 to 16 just over five seconds and 130 miles an hour on the autobahn and also has a base price of around $42,000 .This as tested model , it's $10,000 more because of all the fancy navigation , the beautiful would the expensive , whether you know all the stuff that makes this a premium vehicle , you mean the beauty of this car , of course , is that you've got the utility and functionality of the A4 with kind of the sexiness of the A A5 Coop . Right . So you're combining a coupe with sedan and coming up with something completely different ?Yeah , that's true . We've taken the wheel base from the A4 .Applied access . Really ? The lines from the A5 to offer a very dynamic yet functional design for customer that wants to stay out of an SUV . Yeah , last time you had this product presentation and you had a designer talk to us about kind of , what , one into this in terms of design . And the interesting picture was he actually had a picture of the current A5 patch back , right ? And it just looked too short . A kind of squatty didn't have that kind of sexy , stretched out Look at this car has . And that was that was really important . If you if you had just taken a foreign Adah Adah Sport back hatch onto it , it wouldn't look right . You need the coop lines to make for a proper style car .And I think , but the flip side of that is you needed the A4 wheel base in order to get the functionality rear seat , leg room , cargo space and things like that .She really had to take both of those two elements to make a fantastic car . And that's something I learned in A7 on . We obviously are applying in here in this booth .There's an immediate amount of torque and there's very little turbo leg . Part of that , of course , has to do with the fact that we have a dual clutch transmission . And interestingly , in the S version of this car , you get a standard A8 speed , whereas in this one you get the Duke like seven speed . Now , I did ask the Audi guys , how come in the sport , Here s version , they don't have the dual clutch And they said the issue is really with getting the cart to launch evenly off the line . There's so much torque in the S5 sport back that it's very hard to get it smoothly launch like you could with traditional transmission way that it drives the way that it handles .If you like the A4 , you're gonna love the A5 sport back . It's very similar . I would say that it's very confidence inspiring . You have normal 40 60 split in terms of the torque using the Quattro system , so you feel like you're in a rear wheel drive car even though 40% of the power's going to the front wheels , which makes her very neutral handling . You also have kind of all weather capability and confidence because you know that all four wheels are getting power all the time . The one thing where I would say we're missing a little bit of the sporting this is in the steering . There are four different driving modes comfort , auto dynamic and individual . And , of course , when you put it in the sport mode changes a shift points . So all of a sudden , the car shifting a little bit later . It also kind of heavies up the steering . But , you know , have your steering doesn't necessarily mean more communicative steering .And that's really where electronic staring falls down . Of course , one of my favorite features in any new Audi is the configurable , this play and Google maps navigation . That is just well , it is just so tomorrow .And keep in mind that yes , how did you find me out here to beautiful Seattle on a non rainy day to test drive this car on for all of you Audi fans ? You , of course , will know that this is the second generation of the A5 sport back . We never got the first generation . It was only available in Europe . But this one is available right now at your local Audi dealership . And if it were my money , would I go for the sedan , the coupe or the sport back ? Well , that's an easy one . I go for this car because , heck , how could you not love the utility of a hatchback with the sexiness of a coupe ? Or do you say Coop A is always This is Roman reporting for the fast lane car . Check out tfl car dot com for more news use and , of course , real world reviews . And thanks for watching . And I will see you guys next time . A little bit more driving to do .Look at that . Look at all that room . You get a bike in there , you can get a kayak , and there may be if you kept it up , Maybe folding seats . You probably got a cock in here . Of course you could .You know , you have to try that . Take it to Colorado and sticking kayak in here , see if it sticks out too far . Maybe a stand up paddleboard those air really hot right now ."
217,293,S4,"Yo , Nathan , can you guess what we're reviewing today ? World looks like a supercharged V six . It is a supercharged V six because we gang have the brand new Audi as four and we're gonna take it for a ride and see how it does in the mountains of Colorado . He's got Big Khamenei's . Why did you close the hood ? It was pretty .Come here . Come here . Because it's really hard to tell the S4 fromthe leader A4 really get this little tiny badge and you get lower air intakes . Get the new Audi headlights . But otherwise you'd be hard pressed to tell that this one is putting out right around 330I horsepower . It's kind of confusing because it has a t there . It's not terrible , though , really . It's a supercharger and Roman forgot about this lovely chrome mirror . How could you forget ? Chrome mirrors ? Crow Mayor . Who cares about the premiere looking these four bad ass exhausts poking up tail . This thing is pretty sweet and looks pretty bad ass . You know what ? From the rear its way .Hey , Nathan . 0 to 60 . From what I've been told around five seconds . That's right . Just under five seconds at Seattle but up here in the mountains at , like , eight million feet above sea level , with not a straight road to be seen , it would be silly testing it . Yeah . You guys already hate it when we screw around with that . So we're not gonna really piss you out this time .As you know , part of our review is always trying to figure out the utility of the car . How much room doesn't have . How useful is it for everyday life ? And there is only one way to do that , huh ?Does Nathan fit ? Yeah . It's not too bad . Couple golf bags , a very small body , not a really big body . I mean , there is enough room , and surprisingly , it's kind of deep . I can actually move back a little bit , as you can see .Not bad for a 61 and £250 a Roman house , but you know , it looks marvelous . Thank you . Thank you . So what does this compete with ? It competes with the G37 all wheel drive , and I think the BMW 3 35 I wish we just tested and loved it .A7 speed Dual clutch transmission with paddle shifters or unavailable . Six speed manual transmission . Oh , wheel drive and a flat bottom steering wheel .What's not to like ? You know , you might be interested in this , Nathan . What's the comfort like back there ? It's not bad .Yeah , it's not bad . It's a sports car . It's hard , It's precise . It bumps and jumps and rattles your teeth because it's meant to go around corners fast and B flat . That's what this is all about . Yeah , but it's not bad .You know , Nathan , there are now three versions of the A4 . There's a two litre turbo . There's the supercharged S4 em , that ass RS4 that's coming out pretty soon .So until that comes out . See you next time on the fast lane car . As always , it's Roman and Navan reporting from Colorado .It's nothing to us , man . Shut up .So , Roman , the reason I put you back there is because you have the hair to appreciate the wind up here . Not so much wind . I mean , driving experience . You really you're not missing out on anything , You know , they Then , uh , I come from a Harry family and it's one of the blessings of being a mica . You could enjoy the wide open , rode in a convertible and , of course , feel the classic wind in your hair . My family's Harry , too , but it's on our back ."
218,294,X5,"Hey , guys , I bet when you think of BMW , that's what you're thinking about the M5 the M3 the ultimate driving machine . But did you know that BMW's can be good off road and prove it in this video ? I'm gonna take this brand new BMW X5 on this course . BMW has set up to find out if it is indeed an off road machine or just the ultimate on road machine , and that is coming up right now .The first test will be articulation . Let's see how much play the suspension has . The second test will be approach and departure critical when off roading .The third test will be visibility .I think that will help a lot front facing camera and the fourth test will be water fording . So let's hit this course and see just how good this BMW is when the road gets a little dirty and dusty .All right , let's run this course and try the different test . I'll keep in mind that there are two engine choices . There's the straight six , which is what we have . There's also a V8 . This is the 40 I , and it's not about power , really . When going off road so it doesn't really matter which engine you have , as long as you have enough torque . Two actually get over these obstacles . So this is the one that basically test articulation and traction and grip . Now , a lot of off roaders .I'm gonna turn this up . That is the parking assist cause it's a little annoying .A lot of off roaders will have locking differentials alot transfer case to make the power multiplied when it gets down to the wheels , this one doesn't have it . Or this uses an electronic stability control system to break the wheel that doesn't have traction sending power the wheel that has traction . So it's on electronic form of advanced offloading traction control . This BMW does have extra . I've which means that I can appropriate power front on backwards and having just gone over that first articulation section , it did find , obviously , if you could lock the rear diff , if you could put it into low gear , you'd be better off off road . But nevertheless , for this kind of off roading , this X5 is just fine .Perhaps the most important factor about going off road seems silly , but it's right here . It's the tire . These air to 75 45 twenties . They're Perelli Scorpions , which is an all season tire that's very popular with a lot of German brands . You'll see him on cars like Volvos , and they're relatively good in the light off road area . But the grip obviously isn't there . I think if you want to turn this into something more than just a light off roader , you would have to upgrade these tires to something like an all terrain tire , like a ko to .The other thing about off roading , of course , is that things get damaged , expensive things get damaged . And that's why many people won't take expensive vehicles off road because they're expensive to repair . And in the case of the BMW , I certainly think that's one of those criteria is that people will use and have used to take this off road . And let's face it , you don't see a lot of BMW X5 in Moab .It's just not a vehicle designed for that purpose , but nevertheless it can do it .And I'm hoping that I can prove that here on this BMW off road course and show you guys that you do have Ah BMW , are you thinking about buying one . It's actually not bad off road now , next test is approaching departure angles , so let's stop right here and let's check . This one's out there . Three numbers have determined how good a vehicle is off road , and those numbers are the approach angle , the departure angle on the break over angle . In other words , how big of a barrier can you pull up to and hopefully cross over without hitting ? And BMW , luckily , has air suspension , which means I can raise and lower the vehicle . Right now , the vehicle is at its lowest setting , which is pretty miserable for off roading . But with a flick of a little switch , I could raise this vehicle up and give me a much better approaching departure angle . So let's do that and show him exactly how much difference there is an approaching departure from its lowest position , which is where I have it at now to a tie . His position .All right , now that the X5 is on its tippy toes , I've got a better approach departure break over angle and I couldn't go up this hill , and I can demonstrate the third thing that this vehicle does well and that is site because it does have a full 360 degree camera along me to actually see over the top of that hill . Because when I'm driving and going up that hill , all I see a sky and I don't know what is on the other side of that . And if this was the BMW course , if we're in , let's say Moab , there could be nothing but a 20 foot drop . But this way I could only see . So let's see how good this camera is . So I'm gonna turn on the front facing camera , and one of the cool things that I can do now is I can see what's over the hill , because if I'm looking straight ahead , I don't see anything but sky . But in the camera I can actually see what's in front of me . So I know that there is no 20 foot drop off straight ahead of me . So when I crest on the top of this hill , I'm confident in knowing that I will not go plunging to a fiery death and record very expensive new BMW X5 in the process . And obviously cameras are something that now all vehicles have both on and off road . But this one is relatively high definition in . It seems to do a really good job and kind of telling me what is ahead of me . On the love front . Facing cameras went off roading . I think it's one of the new wonders of the off road world because let's face the visibility out of this bad boy isn't ideal , right ?We come to the next part , which is chassis rigidity , so let's check that out . A good test of a car's ability to be both good on road and off road is chassis regional . Demi , you want a chassis to be rigid so that you can hang the suspension off of it . So this is a bit of a teeter totter that they set up here with the X5 . But let's just see how rigid it is . The question is , can I open the door without a binding ?Yeah , answer is yes , that chess is very rigid because if it was twisting , that door would bind him that open full disclosure .BMW flew me out here to test drive this new X5 and a whole bunch of other vehicles . More full disclosure . My wife actually usedto own and X5 . So I'm very familiar with the breed and the brand .And I gotta tell you style wise , there is no mistaking this for anything else but in X5 . But there is one big change in the new X5 , and I know you guys know what it is . It's right here . It's this excel . Or maybe it's double like so front grille that is the new design language of BMW and love it or hate it big grills air in .And if you want to BMW you're gonna be rocking a double XL front knows it's pretty much classic BMW Inside the X5 You've got this new BMW digital dash . Not a very big display here . You've got this funky BMW gear selector . I've never fallen in love with this . You've got a whole bunch of different controls that are both physical buttons or rotary knob . Associate the ones , or if you're really feeling funky , you've got the gesture . Controls could be rocking some tunes right now .So how accommodating is this X5 for all you wannabe or riel over landers ? And if you want to go over landing , you need a lot of space for you . your friends and your stuff . So back here , I'm 62 I've got plenty of head room . Even with this massive sunroof that stretches all the way back , I've got plenty of me room . I could see five people in relative comfort in the back of the X5 .How about all your stuff ? You know , water batteries , tense water purifiers . Let's see how much room there is . A very generous look at that . There is a lot of space back here . We've got two big backpacks and I love this . Check it out . The still split gate is actually really great for off roading and over landing . I don't know if you noticed it , but , uh , BMW just lowered itself . Look how far down it squats so that you and your pets can get into the back of the thing . I mean , that's incredible . It's just , uh , really thoughtful that you can lowered so much and then raise it when you want to go off road . Of course , the one thing about air suspension is it's probably not the suspension you want . If you're gonna keep this car forever .And for our final test , we're gonna get a little what and wild . There's a part of me that really wants to fly through this water crossing . The issue is it's kind of artificial . And if I do that , I think I would , uh , empty out the water for everybody else That's out here actually testing these cars . So , uh , BMW guys have told me that I must stick to a very strict three miles an hour going through the bossa . So I will do that in respect of BMW . But part of me that just wants to come flying through here and get that classic off for a child of water just flying everywhere . How much water porting does this BMW X5 have ? Well , if you have to ask , you're probably in the wrong vehicle . In other words , this is not the vehicle to go across .Hello . I didn't ask you for help . Please be quiet . No , I don't talk to you . Cancel .Could you repeat that cancel thing is probably not the vehicle that you'd want to take a cross . Deepest , darkest Borneo across multiple rivers . So the question I started out with at the beginning of this X5 off road review is Is this the ultimate off road ? machine as well as on road machine , and I think we've got our answer . In other words , is it as good as the Land Rover or Range Rover off road ? And the answer is , no , it's not that good . The Range Rover and Land Rover , maybe even the Jeep Grand Cherokee have a heritage of going off road . This , of course , has a heritage of on road driving . But if you happen to have a cabin in the woods and it gets a little dusty and muddy , you shouldn't have any problems . Or if you're the mountains and you hit a snowstorm or to this car will do just fine . So keep in mind that if you do want to go seriously off road , maybe you want to stick the German cars .A G wagon is always his Roman reporting for the fast lane car , check out TfL car dot com for more news use and , of course , BMW X5 off road reviews in . You know , we're the only ones out here taking the X5 off road . What is up with that ? Everybody's out there on the race course . Go figure"
219,295,X4,"the BMW S4 is all new for 2019 . And if you're looking to purchase the X four or you want to see how it stacks up against competition or if you're just curious about what's changed , this is the video tow watch experts buyers Guy that's coming up right now , you might be saying , Wait a minute .The new X four looks very similar to the outgoing car . Well , not quiet , because BMW has stretched the X force 2.1 inches Maur wheelbase . Three inches Maur over a length . It's now whiter by 1.4 inches . But that sleek roof line is now lower by 0.1 oven inch , and also that means more room on the inside .Theo theme says that the X four competes against cars like the Porsche Makhan and the Mercedes GLC coop . Yes , and I think that's true .Although the pricing varies , the Jill See starts a little bit less than next four , while the Makhan actually can be optioned way beyond what the next four is , especially in the turbo version of the Makhan .But I also think that export competes against cars like the Alfa Romeo Stelvio and the Jack o R F pace , because those are also yes , more traditional crossovers . But they'll have sleek designs and there high performance luxury machines , so there's actually quite a bit of competition in the space . But the X line up of cars for BMW is a very popular line up , especially the new X two , the X four and the X6 sport activity coops , as they call them , Progress is the name of the game onto the hood .There only two engine options available for the new X four , and they're the two litre straight for and the three litre straight Six Turbo engines And those of you who know BMW engines know that the four cylinder be 46 code name has been available . Another BMW cars already , but it's also under the hood of the X four , and the rating is 248 horsepower and £258 feet of torque . The engine has made it to Nate's with automatic , and , of course , X tries is the only option . It's all wheel drive , but I think the one you really want this this one way Theo Straight six turbo engine with a rating off 355 horsepower , same as the outgoing engine , but a lot more torque £365 feet of torque that comes in at about 1500 rpm . Also made it to an eight speed automatic transmission and also on Lee . Available with X Drive . All will drive .The cockpit of the new X four is typical BMW , and I think that's a really good thing because they pride themselves on driving dynamics and how you feel behind the steering wheel .Plenty of adjustment for me . I'm about 62 telescoping steering , wheel up and down adjustment , bolstering adjustment on the seat .I can get really comfortable behind the wheel and being doubly doing something else . With the new export , they're rolling in more standard equipment across their model lineups .That includes standard navigation standard apple carplay andMe or safety features , including driver assistance technologies that more of them are now becoming standard for the starting price .What would you buy next ? Four ? Well , it's all about performance style and luxury , but it's not about the rear leg room or headroom . My leg room was very limited , them sitting behind myself and my head is touching the ceiling Mrs . With the sunroof . They stretched the leg room in the back here by 0.7 inches , so there is a little bit more space back here .Headroom is still the premium , but it's all about style . Not really X6 utility .Your kids , though , would find themselves very comfortable back here .BMW managed to get a little bit Maur card capacity out of the new X 40 getting about one Mork cubic foot off cargo volume . That means you can carry an additional basketball , maybe behind the rear seats . That's about 35 a half cubic feet of space , and when you fold them down , get about 55 a half . My favorite utility feature is actually the 40 2040 folding rear seat . You can actually just fold the middle section , put your skis in there and go to the mountains .Ah , I would love to do a full review of the export for you , but driving impressions are bargain until July 1st .What I can say is BMW did their magic with this engine and the entire engine line up . In fact , it's quicker and also more fuel efficient , BMW says . Is there to 60 in the F40 I is now at 4.6 seconds , so 0.1 seconds quicker , but fuel economy has improved dramatically . According to the E . P A . This car is rated that 20 in the city , 27 mpg on the highway and 23 combined , which is actually two mpg improvement over the outgoing car . So you're getting more toward faster acceleration and better fuel economy so you can have your cake and eat it , too .What are the reasons to purchase next ? Floral BMW says . It's amore emotional design , right ? You don't want to seem too boring by driving the next three or next five . X four has a stylish roof line , but the roof line has now changed . And I think the biggest difference style wise , comes in the back with those nice led tale lambs that wrap around the fuck about price for a second .Because the new X four starts at 50,000 and $450 that's actually a considerable jump if you also considering to purchase the next three , which starts at about $8000 less for a noble Dr model . But if you're looking for maximum performance , you got to go for this F40 i X Dr , which starts at $60,450.10,000 dollars more than the starting price of the export .But then , if you want a load it all up with optional rear tires , these their twenties but 20 ones are also available , and I think you got to go for 21 . If you're cooking style , a fully loaded one can cost at over $70,000 dropped this expert buyer's guide for Quick the good , the bad and the weird segment the good , a real love BMW 360 degree surround camera , where you can change your angles and perspective the bad .I don't think that is enough on the design to differentiate the new X four from the older one , especially in the front .It looks very similar , and the weird is that they actually decreased the rear headroom . You would think that would increase it just a little bit to make it a little more comfortable . But they said in their style is where it's at way gonna slope the roof .I could sit here and play with his 360 degree camera system a whole day . It's really cool . There's like a backup mode where which uses only the backup camera . It's really realistic picture , although we have a black car here , the camera systems actually showing a silver car actually wish we had a solar car .There's not a weird thing . You want wireless charging or WiFi .It costs extra 400 bucks .Why couldn't that be a standard ? Everybody loves WiFi connectivity or with wireless charging .Also , BMW provides this safety kid , which is basically a reflective jacket . That's kind of strange , but it's very German at the same time .As always , you can accessorize your ex four with M performance parts and graphics .I think this one looks really cool way here in South Carolina is the biggest BMW manufacturing facility in the world . They're producing the X3 , the X for the X5 and soon the ex A7 SUV right here in South Carolina .What do you think this car has more off and badges or ex badges ? I just walked around the car and I counted seven x Pagis . There's four in the doors and tomb or inside of the door sills , of course , on the back as well . But they're 13 m matches on this M 40 i . They're all over the place , including the wheels and the calipers .And inside the latest version of the I drive system actually has more natural voice recognition , which actually works for me . Oh , take me to the BMW Performance Center BMW Performance Center . Greer say yes or select another entry from the list . Yes , BMW Performance Center career was selected start gardens .Would you like to overwrite the current trip with no destination ? Yes , guidance has been started . Wow , it actually understood me . Knife .Here's how it configure my ex , for I would get the M 40 I X drive . Of course , I want the additional performance for maximum style .I would put on 21 in trim and I'll get it in white . And I would also add all the M performance goodies to it . The M Sport appearance package , the Dams for Differential , which is a limited slip that in transfer tort side to side when needed .And , of course , the dynamic handling package , which also limits lean and corners . And that would be a one sweet ride .Of course , it would be a little bit over $70,000 as well .Go back to tearful car dot com from the news views and the real world of using , of course , many more expert buyer's guides ."
220,296,428i ,"once upon a time . Not that long ago , if you wanted a BMW , you could have a 35 or seven Siri's . It was that simple , and most likely under the hood was a straight six . That's what BMW's were all about . Well , times have changed , and today they're probably about two dozen different BMW variants , and this is one of the latest . It's the BMW A4 28 i X Dry Grand Coop .Basically think of it as a sexier A3 Siri's with , and this is what makes it unique . Ah , four cylinder , Twin Scroll Turbo that puts out 240 horsepower and £255 feet of torque at an astounding 1250 rpm , BMW says It'll do from 0 to 60 in 5.7 seconds . Of course , that's a sea level appeared a mile above sea level . Let's find out .So here we go . This time I'm gonna see if I could get under seven seconds , and I think there's a realistic chance that I can . So here we go on a break , torque it . That means I've got my left foot on the brake . Right foot brings up way S60 . Oh , yeah , Look at that . A full second . Faster . So 6.476 point 47 So we haven't been able to hit that 5.7 mark , but we are in a mile above sea level . And , uh , that means there's less air density , less power .So you may be asking yourself , What's the difference between a four Siri's Grand Coop A8 ? Or do you say Coop and a three Siri's ? Well , there are three essential difference is first and foremost . This is lower and superior .It is a coupe , of course , which means that there's a lot less headroom in the back . I wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the back . Of course , I am 62 So if you're short , you should be okay .Other differences . These windows check it out there .No frames . Giving it that sexier coop look .Craft .The more important differences that this car is wide or giving you a bigger footprint , making it hand a little bit better , and the final differences that they moved the weight distribution a little bit more to the rear , giving it a closer 50 50 ideal weight distribution , thus making it handle a little bit better on the track .All right , let's do a lap of this test . Track my mind that I have very aggressive tires . And , of course , that hopefully ideal 50 50 weight distribution . So let's see how it handles turbo power comes out right away , pushing a little bit there , front and push I've got in sport plus mode , which means a traction control is off . It's just up to me at this point into the dirt . No . One but my own fault Steering is sharp . I know it's electric , but getting much better at simulating the feel old .Let's face it , BMW that's taken a lot of flag generation of electric steering . It's just a tad disconnected . Cargoes weren't wanted to apex , but , uh , yeah , I'd like to have a little more field .Small displacement Twin scroll turbos are all the rage as they should be . This technology works 27 mpg combined on the highway and just incredible amounts of torque .Of course , all that technology comes at a price . While this four series starts at 42 the as tested price . Let me check here . I've got my cheat sheet is Oh , my 57,000 450 . That's a considerable chunk of change .On the plus side , brakes feel really strong .Really strong suspension with all that power and torque .Right limit . Really great . Right Here we go . Power coming out almost to track their There's a power . It was gonna hit the brakes really hard before this last turn . No fate . Yeah , you know , it's a BMW out of all the manufacturers when BMW builds a car , they certainly do . Make sure that when you take a test track like this car is capable and willing and eager dance partner TfL scale of buyout least rented or forget it .I'm gonna say , if you want something that's unusual if you want a different flavor of BMW , go ahead and buy it .

221,297,750i ,"You know , it wasn't all that long ago that I stood on this very spot next to the new Mercedes-Benz s class . And now here we have BMW answer that car brands making new 7 50 i x Dr .And the question is a simple one . If you're gonna spend almost $130,000 on a car , did you spend it on this or the Mercedes ? I'll let you know before this review is out .This BMW is a technological tour de force . There are no fewer than five different ways to interact with the cars infotainment system . Everything on the car is changeable , from air suspension to throttle response to shift points . In fact , this car is so full of technology that you almost need to go to well , BMW University just to get behind the wheel . Is that what you think it's BMW diversity . Maybe there should be BMW tried to do with this car out Mercedes-Benz the s class outsells S7 Siri's 2 to 1 So BMW double down on the luxury in this car . Let me give you an example . One of the interesting ways to interact with this car is by gesture controls .And like Harry Potter , I could use my finger to turn up the volume of the radio . I don't know if you need five ways to interact with the infotainment system , but if you like cutting edge technology , this seven Siri's is crammed full e .Don't even tell you how fast I'm going . But , uh , I can show you . Actually check this out . We could do a 0 to 60 on this car to give you the exact number that could what this car can do . Behold by far the best part of this new BMW , it's this 4.4 liter , 440 horsepower , £480 of torque twin turbo power V8 that's matched to an eight speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters . If there is such a thing as a definition of a wave of torque , this engine produces it .Now we're gonna go 0 to 60 run . Using BMW is launch control . I'm a little bit nervous about that , because every time I try to use BMW launch control , it's been it's been a nightmare because they're all these parameters that you have to have for it to work . So let's try it this time I've got traction control This engaged , I've got a closed course . I've got my photographer . I've got my sunglasses on . Put it in sport mode . I'm gonna stomp on the brake hard with my left foot stomp on the accelerator hard . A large stair goes bam ! There is 16 . You know what ? That was really , really easy .And facility l says 4.93 This engine just defines a wave of torque , and that's very impressive for a car that is heavy .Now , when a manufacturer comes out with a new car that has tons of technology , it means , well , extra weight . But BMW says they'd actually managed to reduce this car's weight by £88 . How they've done that . Carbon fiber , aluminum , all sorts of expensive metals that have brought down this way .Even with all this technology , this car has no fewer than four drive modes sport , sport plus comfort eco mode , and that changes everything from the way the steering responds to the throttle response to the air suspension settings . Basically , it can go from , well , Rolls Royce like super while we comfort Thio , I was going to say the M3 Sport package But even in sport , plus this car will always lean toward comfort and luxury .Sitting behind the wheel in a straight line .This car is ultimately comfortable and you could notice a difference . When you go from sports to comfort ICO plus the weight of the steering wheel changes way that transmission works , changes it all changes . But I have yet to be ableto find that M position right . The car will go toe Rolls Royce like while we comfort . But there is no m switch here . It would not go into what I would consider an ultimate driving machine .For me , it comes down to where you want to be in the car , in the s class . I'd much rather be in the driver's seat . It just a much more satisfying driving experience in this BMW . I'd much rather be in the back seat .Look at this .You have your own iPad like control that controls everything from the lighting Thio deceive position so that I have ultimate comfort and ultimate leg room including , of course , the massaging seat .And like a Mercedes-Benz , even my own trade . This car really is all about business level or higher luxury and comfort back here .Let's face it , guys who are buying the Mercedes-Benz those guys air looking for luxury luxury isn't about how fast steering is or how fast the throttle response is .It really is about how you feel behind the seat of the car . How smells come in actually change your perception of your day .If you love classic BMW design , you'll probably love this new 7 50 i . But from my point of view , I find the design just a little too busy . It's almost like they threw in every single BMW que into one vehicle . I actually thought the Mercedes-Benz had a much more holistic design . It was a little bit more striking , a little bit more road presence course . This is a long wheelbase version , but nevertheless , the mark in my book was a better looking car when my figure features of this technology .Late vehicle , ironically , is this little button here . It's a little looks like a perfume bottle , and you hit it and the car just wasps wasps fresh scented air into your face , giving you that spring fresh , feeling a little extra lightness in your step to start a long business .If it were my money , I'd go for the s class simply because I like to be in the front seat more than the back seat . Don't get me wrong .There's nothing wrong with this car BMW through everything from a technology point of view into it , including the Harry Potter like magic wand kitchen sink , its technology piled on top of technology piled on top of technology . But in the Mercedes , all that technology seems like more baked in here . It seems like , well , trying out Mercedes Z8 ese , which isn't a bad thing . But like I said , I'd rather be in this seat .As always . Is Roman reporting for the fast lane car ? Check out TfL car dot com for more news views and , of course , riel . World reviews .

222,298,328i,"let me introduce you to the brand new BMW 3 28 I X , Dr G , T or Gran Turismo . And most important thing you have to know about this car is that it does not share a single bit of sheet metal with the three Siri's . In fact , it's much larger and coming up next , I'm gonna give you an up close and personal take on the brand new BMW with the Great Trunk , and he says , Now he's gonna give you a full review of this BMW coming up very soon .But before that , I want to give you my personal take on this vehicle , and I guess what is most important is , well , obviously , back here , it's this giant trunk . It follows in the tradition of the five Siri's big brother , GT-R , which also has a massive trunk . And unlike the five Siri's , I think this car actually works . It's kind of a hybrid between a station wagon across , over and a sedan , and what makes it unique is that you have a lot more whom than in a traditional three Siri's .In fact , there is more room in the back seat , then you have in a seven series . And that's because this car was built on the chassis of a Chinese three Siri's , which gives it a lot more room back here .Now here's something that's very unique to BMW . It used to be there when you want , open the hood or the bonnet , as you Brits like to say , you would pull this lever and it would open . But not anymore . You have to pull it twice , which does all the magic for you , which means that you no longer have to reach underneath for the little hood latch so that you can get at this BMW two litre turbo charged engine , which puts out 240 horsepower .Now this car comes in two variations . The 3 28 and the 3 35 The difference is that under the 3 35 hood or bonnet is A3 leader 300D horsepower turbocharged engine . They're both quick . They're both fast and in America . At least they're both made it to an eight speed automatic in Europe . You gotta live with a six speed .One of my personal pet peeves is when a kind of some sort of decoration that has no function but check this out . This GT-R has an air intake right here that comes out back here , and I suspect that is too cool the brakes . And this is a funky feature right here , which is unique to the GT-R also dysfunctional , aerodynamically air intake . Air out , take . I like that . I like the fact that BMW actually put something on the car that not only looks cool but does something I like . For instance , Buick that has these three little hood vents that just look cool . But really don't do anything .Course you can't really tell by looking at the car , but if you were to compare it to a standard three Siri's , it would be wider . It'll be taller , of course , be longer , and all that means is that there is a lot of functionality and a lot of utility in this GT-R .Now that comes at a price , and that price is £300 . This car is £300 heavier than a standard three .Siri's now the first thing you notice when you get behind the wheel , the GT is that you're in essence , sitting behind a mountain crossover .It's got a lot more headroom and cut this enormous sunroof .It feels like somebody took a standard three . Siri's put in the oven and it puffed out , too .GT-R . I'm not in love with this interior . I think it feels like a BMW . But some of the plastics , especially the door handle , which is a place that you grab a lot feel a little bit cheap . Otherwise , of course , it's very logical . It's very mechanical . It's very BMW .No , BMW says . They're over 20 different ways to adjust these rear seats , including folding a 30 70 split . A 50 50 split our course . How about completely folding all of the seats down , giving you a giant enormous amount of the room for all your stuff ? All your pets , anything else that you want to carry back here ?In some ways , this car is a bit schizophrenic . I mean , check out this , which I think is one of the coolest features of the car , is this little spoiler that you can push your button and raise and lower . It says I'm all about speed .I'm all about sport , but when you push this button when you see the hatchback flip open and you see what basically is a queen size bed , it says . I'm all about utility , all about functionality . So is this BMW meant for carving canyons ? Or is it meant for carrying stuff ? It's a little bit of both .They're actually four different driving modes , all the way from economy to super sport , where the track control is be activated . The one thing I did learn by driving this car for a week is that the steering is rather numb . I miss the old days when we had direct connections between the steering wheel on the road . By far the best feature of this GT-R was found behind the steering wheel . No , not the steering feel , but the's paddle shifters . This car has an exquisite eight speed automatic or paddle shifting transmission . It rips shifts like there's no tomorrow , and that's unusual for something that has this much functionality .If I'm being completely accurate , there are , in fact , four drive modes . There's equal pro , where there's a stop start feature where the injured will turn off at stoplights . There is comfort , which is well , what you think comfortable there , sport . And then there's not super sport , sport plus and sport . Plus , everything gets tightened up . Steering becomes sharper . The shift points become higher up on the red scale . It just becomes a much more sporty car . At least it's forties . You can get with a hatchback .BMW keeps improving the I drive , and this latest version is getting better . But you know what ?I'm still not a huge fan . I have not fall in love with BMWs . User interface . There's a lot of little buttons . There's a lot of ways you can toggle switches . There's a lot of sub menus at the end of the day , it's very functional . It very complicated . This is a system that is not incredibly intuitive . If you buy this car , I'm willing to bet that you're gonna have to break out the owner's manual when you want to do very simple things , like program your favorite stations . And that's an issue . I love the fact that Germans built a lot of functionality into everything they do . It's all very logical . It's all very straightforward . But at the end of the day , more functionality sometimes the less user friendliness , and this car kind of falls in between that . So I'll give it a five on the functionality slash user friendliness scale when it comes to the latest version of the I Drive , you might be asking yourself , Why not just get the station wagon ?And I would say , Heck yeah , get the station wagon . It has all the functionality , but it has less room than the GT-R . It really depends on what you're looking for .If you're looking for a three Siri's with the room , the utility and let's face it , the functionality of a modern crossover , then this is a car for you .If you're looking for something that's a little bit sharper , little bit more dial , then then get the wagon because it's slower . It's lighter and it handles better .As always . This is Roman reporting for the fast lane car , and this has been my up close and personal . Take on the brand New BMW 3 28 I great trunk . No GT-R , no great tourism . Oh , no , You know what I mean , Mason . I have no doubt that you could drive 5000 miles without any issues except , of course , pouring in gas into this road . But can we say the same thing about in 1968 ? Touch ? No , you can't . I don't think so . We want to find out . So thank you . First of all , to everybody who's backed our Prague to Pebble Beach .

223,300,650i ,"This'll is a brand new BMW 6 50 i X tribe , which means it's all wheel drive and it is just , well , sexy and gorgeous are two words come to mind ?Best of all , safe stuffed of V8 Twin Turbo that produces 400 horsepower and sounds like when you hear something that bagman would have composed himself .We're supposed to help me review this .What are you doing in the car ? Get out here . Come on , get out here . What's wrong with you ? Have you sat in the seats yet ?Oh , that's really nice . This is an extremely comfortable car .This is one of the nicest BMW interiors I've ever seen . Look at the French stitching and the way the entire flow of the dashboard comes right through here . It's It's modern , it's cool , it's chic , and it's still BMW . Very impressive .However , I will say this . If you get this car , get the panoramic sunroof .Otherwise you feel like you're deep .Look how low I am compared in the door panels as an ultimate G T cruiser , and that's basically what this is .You really want to see outward sculpture and the shape of the car , and in this car , you can do it . The hood is beautifully scalloped . I really , truly think that next to the Z4 , this is one of the best looking cars in BMW sleet .This is where the magic happens . 4.4 liter V8 as two turbochargers puts out 400 horsepower and £450 feet of torque . Yeah , but that's really be honest with them . This car is a little bit of a pig . I mean , this is a big engine because it's a big , heavy car .Yeah , weighs over two tons , and it's £300 heavier than the previous version .Obviously , this is a GT-R grand touring car , so it's not really meant for four adults to sit in this car comfortably . But I am in the car , and so is Nathan . Unfortunately , my seat is all the way forward , and they think I'm gonna move it back and you tell me when it gets uncomfortable . Okay , here I go . No , but in all honesty , there's something quite a cool . It's big enough and it's it's dugout scallops . So a child . See , it's pretty well back here like a child . Get back there . It's just gonna take a long time to get the child back here .Ride and handling in this particular vehicle are easily controlled by these two buttons , even go all the way up to sport blessed so low down . The comfort thing is , when you haven't fully blown onto sport , everything tightens up like it's ready to pop . And then when you go down the comfort , it's like it's exhales . It's easily one of the best rides I've had in terms of competition is in .This car isn't basically it's only there's only a handful of cars I can think of , perhaps the Jaguar X Kate , or are depending on the variance . Yeah , and also the Mercedes-Benz C . L . This car offers manual transmission , which they don't , and it also offers all wheel drive .Which way ? Alright , Since we've got 100,000 performance car , we have a little iPhone app that actually measures acceleration . So we're gonna see how fast this is . Keep in mind that this car is heavy and we're at over 6000 feet of elevation , which means it's gonna be slower than you guys are used to make them . Did you put the car in the right mode , right now sport . Plus that shuts the traction control off . But as long as we don't careen into the snow will be good . All right , way S60 . How fast we go . S8 about five and 1/2 seconds . You are wrong . It is 5.0 A3 , just a tick over five seconds . Wow . Economy right now , 15.6 miles per gallon . But it's a thirsty , thirsty car .You don't buy this car if you're looking for economy in terms of value , it's hard to see that with a car that competes with so few cars that cost How much bases ? At 86 ? Ah , a lot of money , but that's a lot of engine note . Yeah , you could do a lot worse .As always , this is Roman and Nathan .See , next time check this out . I don't know if you noticed this , but to hood latches . It's because when you're paying over $100,000 for a vehicle , the Germans for help , you need to . It's awesome . Another thing is any stickers down here to prevent you from being impaled by these . How German is that ?Are you saying these videos of German anything because they're getting that one , but two reviewers for the price of one , and that's a lot less than $100,000"
224,301,X1,"ladies and gentlemen , meet the least expensive BMW that you can purchase in America . The BMW X1 isn't right , Nathan . No , that's actually wrong . This one check this out . Costs over $48,000 . That's with the X1 35 I with ex Dr . I thought they were , like 30,000 and change . That's what the Force Ellen and rear drive coming up next on the fast lane car .I think she looks familiar to you . It's because BMW uses a lot of different cars , including the three Siri's . It's BMW twin power inline six twin scroll , one Turbo two scrolls that puts out 300 horsepower and £300 feet of torque feeds all four wheels through BMW ext . Right now it is pair to a six speed automatic transmission that , I think Nathan wants to point out because it is unique .I love BMW interiors specifically because the seats always seem to be perfect for a big fat guy like me . But this particular one , if you're used to the three Siri's just feels like you're at home . It's a little smaller , but for the most part that's what it is .And it's well laid out and , of course , high quality materials .There are a couple interesting things , though . For one , the transmission you may notice it's not exactly that weird flappy thing that they've got that you got to go push up , push up , push up and well , quite frankly , push buttons when you don't want to . This is a proper automatic transmission . Hallelujah . Here's another thing , though . This cup holder looks like it was added on as , Ah , afterthought . Looks like it belongs in a mini . Not in this car .But other than that , this is a fantastic interior .And once again , cozy seats were big . Big Nathan maven . Are you saying we're fat ? No , I'm saying I'm fat . You're big boned . Thank you .Now , while the front may be comfortable for two large men , the rear not so much . What do you think , Nathan ? I think you have grasshopper licks . And the other thing is , is that I'm sitting behind myself . So if I'm spread eagle and if I'm not wearing short shorts , everything's cool . The thing is , is that there is pretty good headroom . You gotta admit to that . Yeah , good headroom . And once again , at least the cushion is nice . Good for the pushing . I can put my toes under the front seat , which is also helpful . If you've got a pair of kids that aren't , you know , 18 years old . This is usable . If you've got some friends and you want to take your mind off road trip , make sure they're really short . I call shotgun .All right , Nathan , do you fit ? Oh , yeah , yeah , yeah . There's enough room for me to curl up back here and there's enough room for a stroller , which I think a lot of people out there would be interested in because I think the demographic is young . Family one kid . Here's the thing .I think it looks great from the inside . I don't know if I mentioned that red interior and how good it looks , but to me , it's fantastic back here .Well , you know , the only issue I have is that this little thing here , the carpeting and all that other stuff I don't know , I just kind of seems out of place . I think it should have Ah , you know , a retracting thing .But you know , Nathan , for $48,000 you can get a three Siri's . You can get an X3 . And of course , the question while people are asking themselves , is why There's a very good reason for that . And it's called premium small cars . Americans are only now getting used to it with minis and some other small cars that are little pricey .This thing is packed with BMW stuff . Big fat , six cylinder engine , 300D , horsepower , all wheel drive , six speed automatic transmission . All this stuff . Plus it's a BMW , so you are paying a premium .What you're basically getting , I think , is a miniaturized A3 Siri's wagon in a one X1 sized package . Nathan , this is not a very tall cars . You comptel basically a good way to look at this is it's BMW Sze .Last generation three . Siri's with the tailgate .It's a little bit more than that . I mean , what they did is they wanted to make it look like a baby X3 , which is a baby X5 . So this is a baby , baby .The thing is , is that it does have a tailgate .But if you look how the slant is back here , not a lot of space , a little bit of space , I think it might make a good ski car . But in terms of its overall look , Don't the wheels look a little anemic ? They do look a little small , and the ground clearance is a lot small .So dirt road , yes , snow . If there's not a lot of it , Yes , off road , not so much , not so much . You know . We're not gonna take it off road . A lax , I asked him . He said , No .Now anything that I have been kind of scratching their heads trying to figure out what this competes with and Nathan thought it competes with . Well , they're the Audi A3 to a degree , and I think it competes directly with the countrymen . All four . But of course , that's also owned bye BMW so well , maybe doesn't compete in Europe .Of course , it does compete with cars that we don't get , But it's a good looking car , Nathan . It's handsome . I actually really like the front end , and I think all together as a whole package . Good looking . All right , enough talk .Let's go drive it .Yeah , well , folks , as Romans setting up , I know for a fact that this car is capable of the high sixes easily , and it's just me this time because well , we don't have an extra camera . And today so we're gonna do 0 to 60 high altitude . But it should make too much of a difference . Let's just see if I managed to smooth . This is the thing . Big fat engine , little card . It's the same thing that works in muscle cars . Reason I'm saying that there to 60 in 6.1 seconds . And if I'm right , I believe I am . That's not too far off from what BMW estimate . So despite the fact that I'm twice the size of an average test car driver , how did you get this puppy to go 0 to 60 in 6.10 ?Baby , I driving this car gets a lot of fun .I mean , okay , I'm sure that the standard four cylinder engine that comes with this car , which is also 20 power , is fine . But 300D power £300 feet of torque in this tiny car . Yes , very , very cool .It feels like it's got an overgrowth of power and in terms of going around corners , well , it's typical BMW . So you get a good feel for what's going on in the seat of your pants steering feel decent . But most importantly , he goes exactly where I pointed like a scalpel .All right , Nathan . Fun car . Very fun to drive .Question is , would you buy it these rented for Forget it . If you take the price and push it off to the side , I'd say by it because it is crazy powerful for such a small car . You know , I'm gonna give it a Lisa . There's a reason for that . For $40,000 I could get a Mustang GT . Yeah , you get a w r X1 s t I . And perhaps more importantly , I could get a Volvo XC60 , which is also turbocharged , which is better off road has more room .Is , Justus say may not be as fun to drive , but it's certainly much more practical .Okay , But I still stick with the fact that this is funny as hell , and it is powerful , and it's got a big fat Harry . You know what I want to say ? Tires got as as always , is Roman and even remember , subscribed for a new car video every day . See you next time"
225,302,X5,"This'll is a brand new 2013 X5 , but it's no ordinary X5 . It has the M performance and sport package , which means that under the hood there's more power .The wheels and tires are massive 20 inches .It has the X5M suspension , and it costs over $74,000 .Coming up next on the fast lane car , the way you would be so easy to make this car look cartoonish .You put 20 inch wheels on a car .You put these massive fender flares badging , and after a while it starts to look like a pair of itself . But the Germans are really good at that . They know how to get up to that line , but never fall over it . Where a car becomes silly . This card to me looks fast , powerful , elegant and yet it still works as a family car . It's not a car that screams . Look at me . I'm gonna blow your doors off . But it does say in a very subtle and while German way , I can take you at the red light . So don't mess with me because I am a BMW .The biggest change , of course , is that BMW has added an optional third row seat , which is in the way back .And of course , thank you with the seat is that it is very slow you get back here . But once you're back here putting the seat down , it means that I would crush my toes . So you do have a potential seven passenger vehicle 23 and two . But honestly , if you're back here , it's only good for small kids pennants .Or maybe if you happen to own a monkey , that really means that the BMW X5 falls into that between area of being a full seven passenger vehicle and competing with cars like the Audi Q7 or the Mercedes-Benz Geo .By the way , I love this little tailgate makes getting stuff in and out very simple .But to my mind , this still competes with five passenger cars like the Lexus Our X3 50 you might be thinking to yourself with 20 inch wheels and basically a sports tuned suspension .This BMW would be really rough . And if you're thinking that you are absolutely correct , because on a rough road , this car will knock your fillings out . But this is a big but on road like this that's smooth and flat with beautiful turns and no traffic . It is up here . Pleasure . This car is dead flat around corners . I know exactly where the wheels are . I love I love , love , love , love , love this fat steering wheel . There is no car that drives like a BMW , and there is no car drives like a big family sitting hen crossover sports activity vehicle .There are very few cars that could be with this , perhaps a Porsche Cayenne , perhaps Mercedes-Benz AMG .But a twist ease . It is an absolute booth paces .I am just amazed , and I'm driving a four and 1/2 £1000 car like it was one series .It looks like an M drives like in them .It even has the same suspension and wheels that you get an M .But under the hood is BMW's twin power , which is confusing because there used to be a BMW that had two turbos . But this has a single dual scroll turbo , which means basically that the turbo comes out in two phases Now , normally this engine puts out 300 horsepower , but with the M performance package , you get 315 horsepower and £330 feet of torque , for the question is , how fast is this £4500 beast appear in a mile above sea level ? Let's find out right now .All right , 0 to 60 with the X5 . With the sport and performance package now appeared a mile above sea level , we have less air density , which means there's less air for the engine , which means the car's air slower . But turbos help make up for that . Here we go , turbo spooling up , Wow , 7000 rpm and he becomes 60 .Right now , four and 1/2 £1000 is a lot of weight to move even with twin scroll turbocharger .It should be right around 67 seconds , but I'm at 7.83 and once again , that's because we're in a mile above sea level and this car weighs four and 1/2 £1000 .All right , I'm being completely honest . 315 horsepower on £330 feet of torque is just adequate for this car . It's a big , heavy car , as I've already stated , but BMW makes use up every single one of those ponies . By the way , it's cold out there thinking do that so well , it's not enough . Engine just loves to rev .A7 1000 rpm is phenomenal , and it really matches your driving style , especially if I actually get a sport mode like a fine tailored suit .You hear that ? You see that smile .There's a price to be paid for that and come to give you a number .It's 18.2 . That's the M . P G . I'm getting which 5 10 years ago , I probably would have been okay here . But today , when you could get a RS4 50 age that gets 28 of course , it's a different card . I'm well aware of that , but nevertheless gets 10 miles to the gallon more than I'm getting a real world testing that is expensive . Before my money , I'd probably go for the diesel version of this just because you get plenty of torque and you get really good gas mileage and you get the same driving experience .Let's face it , I really like the inside of the X5 . All the materials are soft and riel . Everything you touch and feel feels expensive , especially like this fat and heated steering wheel .Everything is oriented toward the driver , and you know what I'm even getting to be friends with the I drive . They've developed it to the point where it's in my mind , the second best system out there right after the Lexus , which I just mentioned on the house by it .Lease it , rent it or forget it . I'm gonna give the X5 with the sport and performance package a lease it because while it looks like the M , it doesn't perform like them .If you're gonna have 20 inch wheels and all this body cladding , you better bring it . And this car is a bit of a poser .However , I like the X5 in general . So if you're gonna get the plane gene one , I'm gonna give it a buy . It , as always , is Roman reporting for the fast lane car . See you guys next time . And don't forget to subscribe for a new car video every day .You would think it would be almost impossible to get stuck in a wheel drive car in what five inches of snow , but with summer tires that are 20 inches wide . It's actually very easy , as I just lucky I got out lesson There is and snow get the proper tiring"
226,303,650i,"cool . With great power comes great responsibility . First of all , what movie of my quoting leave a comment below the video . And secondly , that's exactly how I feel . Sitting behind the wheel of the 2012 BMW 6 50 i with the M Sports package Hagan this Dave Erickson for TfL car dot com Now , in the vein of full disclosure , I must tell you I'm a huge BMW fan . I bought my 1st 3 28 i as a gift to myself after a job promotion about 14 years ago . Ever since I've been in love with the BMW , so driving a 6 50 I this week has been a big treat for me . With all that said , the challenge in this review , it's not only finding the good , which there are plenty but finding the bad .And there are a few , first of all , with the style 2012 BMW 6 50 i coupe is no longer the ugly duckling of the BMW family , as it now sports a much more modern and elegant design . Gone is the slightly awkward mishmash of cut lines , replaced by a lowered , stretched and widen car with a huge helping off serious road presence . If you like your BMW shaken and not stirred , this is the one for you .Performance in two words . Stopping BMW 6 50 I coops 32 valves V8 with twin power turbo technology puts out 400 horsepower with £450 feet of torque . And in this case , it's the torque that you can really feel as a car pushes you back in the driver's seat . When you floored the car in almost any of its eight , that's right . 84 gears .As I mentioned , I'm testing the 6 50 i with the optional M6 sports package , which costs $4400 .Maur plus led fog lights and steering wheel Driver Assistance Package and a few other expensive goodies thrown in .The ride and handling are really up to you as the BMW lets you select through comfort plus comfort , sport and sport plus settings . That's right . While most cars only have three settings that BMW goes toe four and each of the settings actually works so much so that you can instantly feel the difference between comfort and sport , perhaps the only complaint is the steering , which is Elektronik and somewhat dislocated from the front wheels on because it's so low to the ground .And in this case it's set up with 20 inch wheels with performance tyres . Watch for even the smallest potholes .One of the biggest downsides of this vehicle is the seeding . The front two seats are great . In fact , you could get two full size grown adults up here . Let's say someone like Roman and Nathan , for example , they fit just fine . But if you have to haul around four people , maybe you're better off with a Range Rover .Okay . To be fair , you can get four adults here inside the BMW 6 50 I , but it will be a challenge in the back seats . If you have bad knees or you're not so limber , you might wanna up for the front seats . Then again , if you can afford a BMW like this , go for a crossover or sedan if you want to drive and comfort with four people .So which vehicles compete with the 2012 BMW S6 50 I coop , The answer is none . Okay , I'm just kidding . Cars like Jaguar X K , at least in price . Mercedes-Benz , C . L 5 50 the Audi S5 , while the Audi , the Mercedes in the BMW are available with all wheel drive , the Jaguar makes do with rear wheel drive out of all these cars , The BMW is certainly the most price elastic , with a base 6 50 model starting at 83 grand but loaded .It could easily go over $105,000 .If you want great fuel economy , you better off buying a Prius . BMW gets 15 miles per gallon in the city and about 23 on the highway , which isn't bad for a fast German car . Of course , you might get a lot less because this car is so fun to drive fast and accelerate off the line .The 2012 BMW 6 50 i coop offers a boatload of performance , power and luxury of $83,000 or , in this case , 97,825 .It comes close to supercar performance but still works as an everyday car . So is it worth the big bucks ? Yes and no for me , I want a little bit more room in the car , but the power is intoxicating as always , a state Erickson for tfl car dot com Oh , You know , Nathan , tough life , being honorable journalist . You goto cool places like the Hill Country here in Texas . You get fed . What the hell is that ? Strawberry cupcake from a gourmet cup cake truck . Never seen a man . Shut up about that . Okay , this is good for me . So we're here Test driving the new Dodge Dart . And there's , like , 20 of them , right ? Right there , right behind you , right behind you . But we can't choke . You know there's an embargo , so you'll be seeing this a little bit later . Later . Stay tuned as we bring you . The brand new Dodge Dart from the Hill country of Texas and Nathan , enjoy that manly feast . It's hard to be a journalist ."
