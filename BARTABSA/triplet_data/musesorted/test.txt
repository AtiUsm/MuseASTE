Let's be honest . No , copays aren't about practicality . They drive is important . Like I said , it's beginning this video . The A5 is essentially an A4 in a different outfit on , and it has slightly stiffer suspension , and it makes it feel more sporty and also makes it feel a little bit more uncomfortable over bums . Now you can get this car with three different settings . Normal suspension or sport suspension , which is low in Stepford . Still on make the car more bouncy , or the best bear is the optional adaptive dampers , which have a comfort mo for cruising about Onda sports mode , which stiffens things up when you want to throw the car down a twisty road , and it's leading so much in the corners . This car is front wheel drive , whereas something like a bearded Z4 series or Mercedes C class on normally really drive . Now , put this into perspective for you . A Volkswagen Polo is front wheel drive . A Formula One car is really wheel drive , so yeah , enough said . Really , now you can Of course , get this idea with cultural will drive , and that gives you more grip . But it does make it handle slightly better , but still , overall , I don't think this A5 is as much fun to drive as its German rivals . It's all right , Audi . It's just no . One thing I can't complain about . This car , though , is just how easy it is to drive and to live with .#### #### ####[([9], [7, 8], 'NEG'), ([12], [14], 'NEU'), ([42], [40, 41], 'NEU'), ([48], [49, 50, 58], 'POS'), ([69], [49, 93], 'NEG'), ([102, 103], [101], 'NEU'), ([140], [135, 136, 137], 'POS'), ([12], [145, 146], 'NEU'), ([12, 146, 251], [49, 215, 218], 'POS'), ([12, 146, 251], [40, 225, 227], 'POS'), ([12], [263, 264], 'NEU'), ([12], [275], 'POS'), ([69], [70, 124, 275, 282], 'POS')]

Keeps him started A8 First thing I should point out about this . Audi Q3 is the on driving the S line version that has lowered stiffened suspension and it is quite firm over bumps , but a bit like an orthopedic mattress . It's not uncomfortable . It's all right . You can't d selected and have the normal suspension off the sport model , which is a bit softer and it might be worth doing , actually , alternatively , can pay extra and get deductive suspensions at a press of a button . You could put it into comfort mode . It's really comfy or president button when he goes into sports mode , and then it's stiff from firmer . The steering is really good . The way is not to sensitivity , just turning a bit . But then the more you turn it , the Maur responsive , insensitive it becomes . Which means you could get from full look the full lock in just two turns of the wheel . So it's dead easy to maneuver around town . That means it's not too flighty when you don't want it to bay yet is responsive when you do , you want it to be , which is great . Was not so great , though , is the automatic gearbox . In fact , if I stop the car , so let's say we're a junction or around about not certainly need to get that Gap floored it . Fraud it . Now it's going . It's really unresponsive . This gearbox . I don't like it at all this automatic . It's not great for money .

The first thing I want to point out is that mine was in an awesome blue color . It was part of the M sport package , which had a different front in and some blacked out window trim in different wheels on it looked sharp . I love the exterior of the X1 . I think that the designers did an awesome job , you know , it's just really sort of classically handsome . It's almost a simple design , and I think it'll age really well . Like a lot of BMW's . Just the exterior design was on point . It was fantastic a little bit about the interior . Um , the first thing I noticed when I got in the car is how fantastic the stitching is . There is blue stitching on everything here . It's on the seats . It's on the center console here . It's something Arm rest , conceit on the door there and there . It's on the back seats . The stitching is phenomenal . I love the stitching . I'm a big , big fan of stitching , so stitching everywhere . I know that saying stitching a lot , but I I'm really excited about it . That's my favorite thing about the inside . Beyond that , I was actually a little surprised to see that this one suspect with the wood trim , but I think it looks really great . Actually , it's really refined game . I think some of the other options are things like aluminum and aluminum is fine , but this definitely adds a level of sophistication that I really really dig . Um , Things take a little bit of Ah , down . Ah , downward spiral from there . I'm not a big fan of a couple of things . The first thing I wanna point out is that uses piano black trim , uh , for the for the aircon controls . And you also have a little bit of it down here with the parking brake and everything . And , you know , black is just one of those things where it's impossible to keep clean . You know , I picked this car up this morning , and it was obviously cleaned by the dealer before I got it . She could already see dust on other stuff . And fingerprints just show up . Really ? Well , I'm glad that they don't use it on a lot of the interior , but it is still disappointing that it's really on anything . Uh , the other thing I wanted to call it is the steering wheel . The steering wheel is covered in leather , and it feels pretty good to the touch . But I was a little disappointed that the stitching here is just black stitching . Um , especially since this is the M steering wheel that comes with the M sport package . The stitching on my car are proper in cars has the tri color BMW logo on the stitches . So I'm a little disappointed that they just used black for this . Um , that reminds me going back to the stitching . They even weave in the tri color for the inn logo on the seats , which is just super super cool .#### #### ####[([16], [14, 15], 'POS'), ([50], [48], 'POS'), ([126], [21, 71, 73, 74], 'POS'), ([80], [79], 'POS'), ([50, 80], [6, 42], 'POS'), ([50, 80], [106], 'POS'), ([112], [106, 131], 'POS'), ([112], [15, 42, 131, 139], 'POS'), ([131], [48], 'POS'), ([131], [185, 185, 188], 'POS'), ([131], [208], 'POS'), ([336], [38, 325, 326], 'NEU'), ([38, 325, 326], [382, 409, 411], 'NEG'), ([38, 325, 326], [5, 370, 372, 373], 'NEG'), ([38, 325, 326], [436], 'NEG'), ([455], [12, 462, 464], 'POS'), ([455], [5, 468, 469, 470, 473], 'POS'), ([131, 326], [436], 'NEG'), ([145], [16, 519, 522], 'NEU'), ([16, 519, 522], [569, 569, 571], 'POS')]

Okay , then let's start this review by talking about this car's design . So the big change over the previous C 63 is the new AMG Grill sensitive horizontal slats .

I want to show you this . This center console design is reminiscent of the original A8 Syria's look very similar . Yes , I'm a bit of a car geek . Now , let's talk about the quality . So you've got leather on the dash , which feels very well maze . There's metallic effect here . You gotta get up here . I just wish that they had metal window switches like you get in Mercedes s class Coupe A8 . However , unlike Mercedes-Benz , consecrate pay which just have the odd , really cheap feeling , better trim about the place which lets the side down . This doesn't have any . Everything feels quality and good way to test The car's quality is with the sun visor , just how assaulted it feels and how well the mirror cover slides and that feels expensive . I was like the fact they got metallic effects here for the climate control running events . You've got the light design as well . Very nice on DDE . I thought you got frameless mirrors and horrible best all round in which I can feel a little bit . Chief Terry , this is really nice .

It's also predictive . So , whereas in the old A 45 it would only shunt drive real words when the front axle slipped . Now it can predict that moment of slip and send Dr Rhee words before the front axle loses traction . These are quite important changes because certainly the way the former drive system worked in the old A 45 was one of the frustrations we have with that car . The other one was that the chassis , the suspension was so rigid , so it felt crash she over a bumpy road , and on UK roads , that meant that it was compromised now that a 45 was spectacularly fast 370Z six horsepower bundles of grip , loss of body control . But strangely , it just wasn't that engaging to drive something like a rent a sport .

It feels super luxurious for a press . This button here , I can control the front passenger seat . Push it all the way forward . Obviously , you can have your CEO sat here , aren't you ? And yet , on the whole , very comfy long wheel base or even in the short wheelbase . To be fair , if you need to carry three abreast , it's doable , you know , little bit cramped on head room .

Audi still talks about 40 60 split front rear on A4 drive system , but it just feels from little driven to Mei . We've been coming out of every term .

So the crux of the matter how the ride and handling spot on , I would say better and respect the handling .

I mean , you almost wouldn't describe it as firmness it It's never course . It's just a little bit excitable . It wants to deal with bigger infants quickly and then get on with it . On the trade off is a car that handles really , really nicely . It's precisely eternity in balance . Did you drive it through ? It feels classically rear driven . It's kind of everything you wanted . Three serious to beat , and it's no to dialed up . So the initial off center steering response is fairly gentle , actually . Feel the front tires load up , get lots of confidence .

That's not necessarily traditionally something that Audi is done brilliantly either . But on this tea first you've got a car that drives pretty much as well as inland . Is it as good as a Volkswagen Golf R ? I think probably not . The steering is still a little bit like a little bit , a little bit remote . There's not much in the way of sort of feedback and feel through it , but it's much better than other teams . On the chassis is a similar sort of a similar sort of thing , really . It doesn't have solidity and the ground covering pounding this of a goal far , it feels , feels actually a little bit a little bit lighter , a little bit more , more agile , possibly slightly more loosely so , to the extent arguably slightly less rewarding for point .

For me , the tribute to this car is that while it's as wild as a wolf , it can also be is controllable as a sheep dog . If you put the car into sports handling mode , it gives you a little bit of tail slip if you want it . But we'll safely gather you up before you get past the point of no return . That's brilliant if you want to feel like a driving God , but you don't actually exposed eventually as a false prophet . As you end up backwards in a ditch , the only real lead down to the whole experience is perhaps the steering . Yes , it works . But unlike in some other performance cars , it doesn't make you feel the road . And so it's a bit like trying to re Braille while wearing oven gloves . Still , you don't always want to feel things , do you ? And as your cycle this car through its various driving modes , going from race to sport plus two sport and then to comfort , you can fill it gently , lower its guard and just become a little bit more chilled out as the throttle response softens and deductive suspension just relaxes , and it becomes more comfortable on even the exhaust .

If you like the A4 , you're gonna love the A5 sport back . It's very similar . I would say that it's very confidence inspiring . You have normal 40 60 split in terms of the torque using the Quattro system , so you feel like you're in a rear wheel drive car even though 40% of the power's going to the front wheels , which makes her very neutral handling . You also have kind of all weather capability and confidence because you know that all four wheels are getting power all the time . The one thing where I would say we're missing a little bit of the sporting this is in the steering . There are four different driving modes comfort , auto dynamic and individual . And , of course , when you put it in the sport mode changes a shift points . So all of a sudden , the car shifting a little bit later . It also kind of heavies up the steering .

He did that accessibility is the Quattro all wheel drive system , which dynamically deviates from a standard 40 60 front rear split as traction demands , sending as much as 85% of the engine power to the rear wheels . Adding to the RS5 all wheel drive excellence is a torque vectoring differential that improved agility by over driving the outside rear wheel driver's seat . That constant redirection of torque manifests itself as utterly predictable , drama free acceleration out of the corners and add to that abundant lateral grip and slightly numb but precise steering . And you have a compelling , dynamic package that welcomes drivers rather than intimidating them , which is a nice trade on unfamiliar back roads , where the high speed Benz and blind crest that defined Sears point further reassuring the driver are powerful front brakes consisting of 14.4 inch disks squeezed by A8 piston Brembo calipers .#### #### ####[([9, 10], [7, 8], 'NEU'), ([9, 10], [13, 14, 23, 24, 25], 'POS'), ([56], [55], 'POS'), ([51, 69], [68], 'NEU'), ([51, 69], [75, 76], 'POS'), ([90, 91], [89], 'POS'), ([97], [93, 94], 'NEG'), ([97], [96], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [103], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [108, 109], 'POS'), ([121, 122, 123], [118, 119], 'POS'), ([20, 144], [142], 'POS'), ([20, 144, 149], [150], 'POS')]

First , let's address the small part . Rear seat headroom Certainly better than the C l . A . But I'm five foot 10 and just barely brushes up against the headliner over here in the right seat . If you move to the middle , it's a little bit better . But you do have a center tunnel that you need to think about . If headroom is a major priority for you , be sure to claw your way to the roomier and more comfortable front seats .#### #### ####[([8, 9, 10], [11, 12], 'NEU'), ([8, 9, 10], [4, 12, 35, 45, 49, 50], 'NEG'), ([88, 89], [84], 'POS'), ([88, 89], [86, 87], 'POS'), ([58, 59], [43, 62, 64, 65], 'NEG')]

Welcome to the inside of an Audi s Q7 where , if I may need to talk some numbers , quite few numbers of some significance . 1 435 metric horsepower for 29 to 2300 kilos or thereabouts . A3 A7 seats standard as A4 lead to V8 62 miles an hour in 4.9 seconds . Cost 70,000 quid . And then there's the most significant numbers of all . Â£664 for torque . Problem . 1000 all P m .

When you turn them into a corner , they just start in the nose digs and they just turn this one not so much . But once you get into a rhythm with it , yeah , it is good fun . It really is . Only only complaint really has to be the fact that the suspension settings aren't quite right for the UK , so Comfort's great when you're cruising around , but it's just a little bit too soft . Really . Thrashing the cars in the corner does lean a bit too much . And then when you put in the dynamic mode to make it better , it's nice and flat in the corners . Bart , the problem is , is then just a little bit too bouncy over bumps . There is another mode called Auto , whether Costas is it out . But that still doesn't quite cut the mustard . Really . What we need is another mode called British , which is perfect for our roads F40 though the Germans , they're never gonna do that . Still , overall , this is a great around real world supercar .

Wants to know how does launch control work and how fast we go from 0 to 60 . So , to launch troll in Audi experience the same process across the board . You push the S C button .

But I think that is a brilliant If there's 10,000 people who use zero petrol on , they drive to work in cars and they've got so much charge them at work . That's a big plus .

Now one of things I like about this car is the space in the back seat . So I put these in their original position . Leave across Now there's loads of knee room . There's loads of head room .
