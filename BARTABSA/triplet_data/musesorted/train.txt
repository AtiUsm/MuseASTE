Now let's move on to the back seats side . As with the absolute and you got lots of Nero , headroom is pretty good as well .

The seat bench isn't quite as deep as unavailable , if I see so it's not quite comfy for long journeys as a fighter's . I don't think in the back if you're carrying two people .

So 15 miles an hour it will shut the engine off , making you coast to the stop light , and you won't know it because everything and there's a lot of electronics in here will remain on . But the engine will turn off , and it's relatively seamless , right ? The biggest complaint most people have with Stop Start is that whole car kind of shakes won . It turns back on , and it's kind of uncomfortable because if you're an old stop start system , the air conditioning may turn off , the heater may turn off , but here it's pretty much seamless .

Cayman always did keep the things that mid engine balance means that it's quick response . Thio turning the weight is closer to the middle of it meant that it was more agile .

We've gone to the boot , so out of the back seat . This is the biggest of boot in its class . It's absolutely massively . Look at that . Loads of room there .

Also standard or models get an electrically powered tailgate , which seems to take an absolute age to open . But once opened , the boot is really , really practical , and it's got a couple of really cool features that I like . So the 1st 1 is the fact that look , you've got a lockable false floor so you can hide away your valuables . Another neat thing is that the parcel shelf is easy to remove on DDE . We're not used , you can fit it under There is great . This car has no load lifter . The only problem is , is that the low tide is quite high so it's gonna be a bit of an effort for your old dog to leap into the back . You won't find this an effort , though .

The deals you can get on this car are unbelievable . This is not unexpected car .

It just goes more surprising to me . Is the transmission ? When I saw him respectfully , there was no DSG box . They just had an automatic .

So the one for the driver on this G 63 which is standard by the way , On this particular car , you can swipe through different menus and views .

Let's stop this review by talking about this car's key feature , and it is this swoopy back end . Now there's a trade off for it . It means the overall big capacity is 5% less than the X3 Sze . But it's not that big a deal , is it ? You think , But it's not the size that matters . It's what you do with it that counts . And here's the problem . You say , Well , this is nice and square . Generally , that lower tapered line for the boot means that you can't stack things too high further back . So , for instance , for us to try and shoot the boot now , it's not going to have any of it . Look , they didn't like that at all . Put that back up . Also , there's a bit of a boot lid there to lift stuff over , which can be a problem if you got heavy items such as this , at least is a metal plate there , so you don't scuff your paintwork .

Then there's some strapping for your bottles on Looking from storage . No shit . Some removable storage jets , which can use to hold your manky date sushi , look the cover for the other floor Storage is not a gas Strat . Identical problems keeping it up . It's all right . Listen , I promise No more innuendoes in this video that says it's gonna turn into carry on car reviews . So if you look , there's some decent space , there's not a spare wheel . There's not even any tire repair kit because this conference on run flat tires now more on that later because it does actually matter . I think I do like about this there look like some other cars . You could fall down the back seats in here , levers in the boot so you don't have to go running around on the load area .

But when Wright heighten all the S4 is more aggressively tuned . Suspension still feels nearly as complaint is that of the standard A4 .

So , Chris , between going around a turn like this , you don't just want the wheel to feel heavy . But you wanted to communicate what the road is doing . So when the car's weight shifts because it will shift especially you taking quarters fast from the front wheels to the rear wheels , you know when that's happening . So that's when you know to put on the gas to give it as much potential power out of the corner as possible and oftentimes new electric steering cars . And what I mean by that , of course , is that these cars have gone to electric steering . They've lost that kind of tactile feel of actual road surface way .

Just make sure to correct that and the drive . The handling is just amazing . It Isolde precise . I mean , whenever I know I've driven different cars and especially the reason many ravenous if you have a fear off rolling over . But that's quite obvious . But when you sit in a sedan , I've driven on Ultima before and coming to this one , I can feel a lot of difference in the steering . Just immediately , the car points in the direction that you want , although I would say it's a little less responsive , and I sometimes don't know where what what exactly is going on when I am turning ? And for that reason , the feed bank is a little on the downside . But all of that removed the past still handled really well , especially on a roundabout or O . R , especially New A8 where you have a lot of round about and that's mean , I know I can go train 20 kilometers compared to the ultimate because I think basically it's because of the shorter wheelbase and also the way this car has bean designed . Now that there are some come some manufacturers that make breaks so sensitive . I mean the moment you step on the the dependent on the brake pedal calibers just gripped this breaks and it just stopped . Not in this case , this one is very different . Now whenever you just break the desert that there's like a softness to the pendant which I really like , which is basically if you raced . You know that you know a soft pedal is what you want because you have a tendency at high speed to to really push the brake harder than usual . And if your travel is very less or in other cases , if your brakes are very sorry , if your brakes already sent to do , then it immediately just lose your guard down .

But best of all , I've got a lot of control over my backseat environment . In fact , I've got so much control that well , let me look the Audi product manager demonstrate , because in the four hours I've had in this car , I have not been able to learn off of the functions that are baked into the back seat s o . Of course , the backseats important in any large luxury sedan . Front seat back . See , One of the great things we have in this is we have what we have for the U . S . Is the receipt comfort package where you got the individual reroute board seats . It's a five seater version , but when you put the center console down , you get a lot of controls in here so you can recline the seats a bit . You've got lumbar on , and then we also have what we brought with this generation . A8 is ah , rear seat remote that is integrated into the head unit of the car and all the electronics and basically this remote controls the seats , the lights , blinds , radio , media and also some of the sightings in the car as well as the H back for the back .

You get a massage in this . So we've got different massage programs in here . You get a wave ? When we were driving up to this today , we put it on . I like to use the activation . Kind of wakes you up a bit while you're driving , and you can set the different intensity of this that you can do . So there I have the right , um , seat down . And if I wanted to change to left here , we'll give you the relax ation massage , and you can sit in the back . The massage . We had this in the previous generation , but with the new generate , we had 10 massage nodes in the front in the rear previous generation . Now we have 16 in the front 18 in the back , so 60 to 80% Maur massage with two more programs in there . So even higher level of luxury and kind of .

You get the car with ionized air conditioning and very sense . So look , I can choose between a wolf to pure water poles or maximus of lush grasses .

I thought I'd start this review at the boot to let you see the rear end of this car , which once again isn't the most beautiful V8 to Sendai . And this is another standout feature . BMW has kept the X5 split tailgate . I really like it it's handy if you just want to perch on here or push things in . Another thing I really like is this . Look , this is one of the disadvantages A7 split tailgate . You wanna reach in , you need to put it back up . But I like this look . The parcel showed impressive put in there and just slides out so so very easily on most of the cars . It's a fast BMW really solved the problems of its . Put that down again . I'm sure you mean easily Slide in this out of the booth . How do we go ? Look at that . There's plenty of other useful features in here , So we've got various tie down places there underneath here , and that's that . Look on a gas truck stays up . That feels posh . What would know their spare wheel in there ? But this car's on run flat tire . So you just got space which in store stuff in on . Let's return to this parcel shelf because , hey , you look at this . It will fit under here . It's that way . I'm trying to figure out how to do I know you can do it . I can see signs here .

Let's move into the back seat . So once again , here in the rear , it's all very Rimi . Yeah , nice , decent me room is good headroom I can in this particular car look recline the seats if I want to . You can't get the seats that slide forwards and backwards like you can in an Audi G5 . But it's not too bad in terms of going three at once . Well , there is this humping the floor , but it's not too high on the middle .

Still , it looks pretty . Sleep on . The orris has some key styling upgrades over the normal A4 advance .

Because Manu models aren't that great in the pedals offset to the right , however , we can forgive the force in his system of these because it does have some cool features .

So I have basically done to the Audi one is this black stripe , which I thinking whether we do it soon because they didn't use proper rapid fire , which was a mistake . You see the sign that shrink really glue . Obviously the roof has been done twice recently . Redone . Uh , come down here . We've got the black spot . DB9 summer , obviously the block vinyl wrap on the back of the boot . But that was not the first . That was . A lot of people think the graphics act on the car . It was actually the Audi low . But some people think that come of the island , there's no we did that . I put them on more or less about five days after I picked up the car . Then after that , about three months , two stripes , then the spoiler , then the roof . I don't sit in the back of the car . That's all I've really done to the Audi wound , maybe the registration , But I don't think that really counts .#### #### ####[([46], [4, 50], 'POS')]

There is a price to pay for having that fridge other than just the cost , as the fact that it really does eat into this car's boot space .

So far , then the Audi G5 is pretty impressive . How does it feel ? Road First question you might have is , Is this SUV in a sports utility vehicle ? Exciting on the answer to that is no bearded X5 is more fun to drive . However , the other question you probably have is is it a good car to drive on ? The answer to that is without doubt , yes , so this thing steers well enough because our corners well , there's loads of grip . All models come with Cuatro war will drive , yet you know it does all that it needs to . It's comfortable as well . So I do have a word of warning . You see , this particular model is yes , light . It's got lowered , stiffened suspension on it , perhaps rides a little bit too firmly . But if you ask your dealer to go with the normal suspension , yeah , goes over very , very well . However , for around £1000 you can get the optional adaptive dampers on . Then it's even more comfortable .

Mentally , the rear discs as far as the breaking field goes . I've had absolutely no issues .

welcome back to the Audi RS6 performance . Now I look back on previous videos to see when was the last time that I featured RS6 on channel . Turns out it was February February . What's going on ? I can't believe it . I mean , because I drive the car so often , I guess to me it feels fresh , but I couldn't believe it . So the last time I drove the car on the channel was actually comparing it with the Porsche Panamera sports charisma . Which kind of nicely brings me onto the future off this car on the future of that space in itself . What I mean by that space is this sort of super estate cars . Now , when this car launched from this generation off , the RS6 launch was still kind of the only riel proposition in with super estate market's . In a long time since BMW had an M version , often estate car yes , while Mercedes-Benz have the E 63 the way that the space has evolved since this car has launched a competition simply didn't exist . And so I want to talk about the future of this car , how it's going to sit in the coming months on this channel what might be replacing it ? Annals of discussion off the space in general . Now there's been something about the super estate market , which has become fascinating off late now . The previous video to this it was actually me driving the Ferrari G T . C . Four loose . So the B 12 version previously to that drivel V8 . While I guess strictly and technically that is more of a hot patch because it is a hatchback format , I do think it's fundamental . Platform does land itself smack bagging competition with cars like this , despite the fact that the GTC A4 luso , particularly V 12 version , is an additional £200,000 on top of the price of this car .#### #### ####[([52], [123, 124], 'POS'), ([302], [301], 'NEU'), ([344], [3, 12, 94, 182, 190, 338, 339, 341, 344], 'POS')]

But it doesn't light up the tires , either . That's really nice . I think we should expect to see this sort of system on other MGs in the future because it works really , really well . The original AMG GT s from a couple of years ago had to be completely honest . Bizarre steering spoke early light , ultra quick . No real sense of connection at all . I just meant that you felt nervous in the car for the 1st 2030 miles . It took a long time to actually get used to it . With this GT-R , they proved it massively . They just calmed it down , taken some of the hyperactivity out a little bit . And so now it's just so much more intuitive . You can start to pour the car into a corner in dry conditions . You feel like you've got a good sense of connection to the front axle . And even though those front wheels are a 1,000,000 miles away , you really felt like you could get right on top of it on the way into a corner . This car's also got rear wheel steering . That's kind of standard across the board for ultra high performance cars these days , and you can feed it working at low speeds at very low speeds . I mean , when you're maneuvering around , you can just feel the rear axle helping the Carter negotiated higher speed , you're not aware of it . I think one of the important things about this car dynamically is that it's kind of got a narrow operating window . So get it on track . We'll get it on a smooth road on a dry road , and it is spectacularly good fun . It feels exciting . It feels raw . It's focused . It's really , really good to drive involving communicative .

This breaks that comes standard on this one and in my short drive today have had absolutely no issues with a breaking feel or anything like that . When it comes to the handling it suspension on the X seven , you will find a double wishbone front suspension in the back of lightweight multilink integral rear suspension and one of the best parts about the X seven . Contributing to its smooth ride is there is a to Axl self leveling air suspension . It's so this is basically gonna automatically adjust its height based on road conditions , meaning If the X seven cents is you were going on the back roads going a little faster than perhaps you should be , it's gonna lower the X seven a little bit , providing a little better handling . And at the same time , if you're just cruising , it's gonna raise that height up to not only give you better ground clearance but give you a more comfortable ride as well . And it actually gets better than that because you can manually adjust The height of the X seven is well located just behind the shifter there . That's gonna give you the ability to raise the X seven up 1.6 inches above the standard setting if you wanted to . So really quite a bit of control . And again , with that air suspension , you're going to get so much of a smoother ride as opposed to an SUV without it .

This BMW is a technological tour de force . There are no fewer than five different ways to interact with the cars infotainment system .

Audi is most definitely a car company with the wind in its sales right now on this latest creation , the frankly rather scary looking RS5 could well be its crowning glory .

It also has a seven speed dual clutch gearbox as standard alongside one of the most sophisticated four wheel drive systems ever seen in a road car . And so we come to the potentially thorny issue of price . Well , this is very interesting because £54,000 the RS5 is undeniably more money than it's obvious rivals from Mercedes and BMW .

Now a little bit about the lineage and wise of old recently within now the themselves . I want you so far as to say that Cuatro has gone . But in days gone by , Cuatro was always the stamp off performance from Audi . But however , in recent years Audi has gone through somewhat of a rebrand , and now basically anything that comes out of Audi that is fast eyes under the name of Audi .

Technology doesn't end there , though . There some to take the strain out of long motorway journeys such as the steering and lane controlled assistant . So one of the things it can do is read the lines in the road , and it will actively steer the car to keep it within the lines . Now you're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel , and if you take , the market will probably give you about 10 15 seconds of driving that you hands on the wheel before it will warn you , and then it will shut down the system . But I've noticed that if you just rest of me on the steering wheel , it pretty much thinks your hands on it . I will just continue working . So I'm just driving along on the autobahn , cruising at 100 kilometers an hour . The car's doing everything for me . It's steering . I've got the active cruise control on , so it's keeping my speed , and it's using radar to measure to the car in front . So now the conference is breaking . This car is breaking automatically . It also reads a speed signs on I Got My Cruise Control set 100 read that sign , and then it suggests that I might want to change my setting on the cruise control and at the touch of a button , I can reset my top speed again as that new speed limit .

So let's touch upon the handling of the Audi R8 and actually being behind the wheel of the full point to V8 my first impressions of actually driving it for the first time , which was after I bought it . Because , of course , I didn't test drive . It was that the steering wheel is really quite heavy , and at low speeds it takes a lot of getting used to . It is almost having the Vauxhall Astra , which is in 2007 which obviously had power steering this sort of films like I'm going back in time a bit and it doesn't have power steering way . We've got some nice turns and the brilliant thing about cars . Obviously it's built for speed cornering and just just hugs the corners like it's not even trying . Which is probably the best thing about driving a car that's so low to the ground has such fat ties so much power driving the box Astro . The tires are probably half the week , so when you're going around the corner like you feel like you're gonna topple over like a bus or something like that . But like driving , driving around like with the traction on . Obviously it really , really hugs the road . And it is a real pleasure to drive . Just coming around to this . Are you better now ?

There's an immediate amount of torque and there's very little turbo leg . Part of that , of course , has to do with the fact that we have a dual clutch transmission .

Now , I did ask the Audi guys , how come in the sport , Here s version , they don't have the dual clutch And they said the issue is really with getting the cart to launch evenly off the line .

This is the lower perversion with 286 horsepower , but lower power . It does not feel that's all . It's a very strong engine of the not 60 in just six seconds on . Look at this , right . If I go to about 40 miles an hour , plant my right foot . Look at that speed build . I am now doing 70 . It's effortless , and it doesn't even sound like a diesel . And it's smooth , almost like a petrol . University says It will do over 50 odd miles per gallon , and I'm actually averaging 38.6 . That's really , really good for a car this size .

Of course , Audi is known for its Cuatro all wheel drive system , and this A7 , along with the A6 have Audi is newest cuatro ultra , and that's an interesting system because what it does is it basically allows the car to become more fuel efficient by allowing the front wheels to do the driving now in the old front wheel drive biased all wheel drive systems . What would happen is the front wheels would lose traction . Let's say you're going around the corner and then the system would sense it and would send power to the rear wheels . And then the rear wheels would get power and immediately lose traction because they just got up and you go around the court in the back and would come flying out . That was not a great system , but Audi has thought of that . This is actually a predictive cuatro all wheel drive system . So while the front wheels do most of the driving , this car can actually predict when you're gonna need all wheel drive . So when you're going around that corner and the front will start to slip the rear wheels already engaged . But you don't get that sudden snap oversteer on snow , and instead you get the confidence of having all we'll drive even before you know you need it . At least that's what Audi claims .#### #### ####[([47, 48], [46], 'POS'), ([11], [9, 10], 'NEU'), ([11], [10, 52], 'NEU'), ([215], [0, 9, 10, 11, 222, 224], 'POS'), ([215], [139, 211, 212, 213], 'POS')]

Now , though , it's time to hit the rail to see what the G . L . A is like to drive now . Like I said at the beginning , this review the G L . A . Is based on the A class , but I do find it better to drive now . The main reason for that is that you've got jacked up suspension on that makes this car more comfortable on . That matters a lot because the A class is a little bit too for riding . I think so , as you move up the range , you do get sported suspension , which is firmer on bigger wheels , and that does start to impair the right quality somewhat . So just be aware of that on . There's not really a trade off in terms of handling the sport . Your card . While the supposedly sporting guards they don't really go around corners any better part . The problem for this is the fact that the steering it just doesn't feel that good . You can't tell what the front wheels are doing .

We've also made a couple of minor modifications to the gearshift . It's got a short shift kit on it now , so it's a much more direct , much tighter gear change . The standard car can be quite wallow we quite vague . This is lovely and tight . This car's also got a clutch pedal modification , which makes the pedal itself heavier . That's really lovely on a quick drive like this one , but when you're in traffic driving through town , it just feels a bit heavy , a bit unnecessarily heavy on the differential . So it's a quite if limited slip differential . It makes a huge difference . That's a massive improvement over the standard cost . The standard car , as it comes from the factory , didn't have an air less dear just hadn't opened death . Now the problem with that is that because even the standard car's got loss of power . When you get on the power away from a corner , particularly if you've got the traction on the stability control off . All that happens is the inside rear tire just lights up now with this quite LSD , when he gets on the power away from a corner that this bites and it sends the drive to both wheels . And so you get much better traction for one thing , much better drive away from the corner . But also , if you stand on the power really hard on both wheels , start spinning up . You know the car is going to slide , and then it's very controllable , is progressive and you simply Jews size of the slide with your right foot overall . Having that def in there just makes the car march or satisfying to drive , less frustrating on more controllable . It's a really good upgrade . The space is on the front axle . Just quite little 10 mil spaces on the front axle just wide in the track with a little bit make a good difference to the steering . It feels more positive now . Finally , this suspension biggest upgrade . We've made this car the first grade that we made as well . Spring rates have actually gone up slightly , about 10% but What they've done is taking a lot of rebound damping out off the dampers . Their rebound is the speed of which that wheel can drop out of the arch , having bean shoved up there by a bump or by the car leaning over an event . So we've got more spring right , and that does mean that particularly low speed and on a bumpy road there's a little bit of edge to the ride quality . That's true . But by taking out that rebound dumping , what you're allowing each wheel to do is to roll through potholes , roll through sunken drink covers rather than crashing through them , and that really improves comfort . But this car isn't about a limo like ride quality Overy cushion right quality . It's also know about being super stiff on super hard for the track . It's fast road set up , ready on . Where really starts to work beautifully is on a bumpy road when you're driving at speed . That's when you feel how brilliantly the suspension is working . The body is kept well controlled . Certainly much better control than the standard suspension did understand . A suspension . The body would float around the rear ends with corkscrew . It would get loose over undulations and compressions , and you have no confidence in it . Now the body is much better controlled . You also feel how well the suspension is working to keep each time pressed into the road . Only when the tire is pressed into the road can generate any grip . So what you find is that you've got much better body control . You've got more consistent grip , and as a result , you've just got more confidence .#### #### ####[([7, 10], [6], 'NEU')]

So basically the A3 has no choice but to be absolutely outstanding , and the good news is that actually , it is quite a step forward . In particular , the ride seems to be a lot more pliant here .

Really , the only criticism I have is the rather unrefined nature of the optional seven speed , double clutch automatic transmission . You accelerate from the stop , especially when the transmission is cold way . That's A7 speed is absolutely brilliant . On the race track , there's virtually zero lag time from the moment you depress the paddle shifter in the gear change occurs , you can actually feel a little bit of partial engagement as you return to throttle . It's pretty neat for something that doesn't have a traditional clutch and again way are quite taken with the six speed manual driving right now has short throws . Its Responsive has an auto rib match feature . The clutch is light and really easy to use , one to get along with really good steering .#### #### ####[([21], [10, 11], 'NEG'), ([21], [34], 'NEG'), ([16], [41, 42], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [51, 52, 53], 'POS'), ([82], [12, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77], 'POS'), ([64, 65], [85, 86], 'POS'), ([105, 106], [114], 'POS'), ([19], [125], 'POS'), ([19], [81, 128, 130], 'POS'), ([139], [0, 138], 'POS')]
You could hear that what happened thing was a gear change sound on an engine sound , which I've discovered a few minutes . I've been told it's not the rial noise of the engine and that it's a manufactured sound , and it took me a long time to work out where the sound came from until I put my hand on the speaker there and then when I changed gear , the noise is coming through the speakers that is completely fake . Sandra , so sophisticated that as you change gear , if you can hear , it's very subtle . It's only something a testosterone obsessed male but begin to notice .

I wish it was 100% electric like that in this and leaf that's going the other way . You know , it just feels like it should be an electric car , cause it's just a brilliant electrical . When is one ?

So if you push it too far , so I'm like pushing it to where it's gonna come out of hybrid mode and go into got electric motor goingto use the petrol engine .

Hello , ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to Supercars of London . And as you can see behind me , I have a brand new 2015 Audi t t . Now , firstly , I hope you guys enjoyed the block update that I provided with you yesterday which actually featured this car . But this is gonna be , um , or oven in that look on . First impressions and opinions are about the carved on the X1 have done the X3 . So I moved up to the TT one before the Audi R8 V 10 plus which I assume and hope is coming very , very soon . And the reason why I'm quite excited by this car's It's got the virtual cockpit , which is derived bit of technology that is going to be in the new Audi R8 v 10 plus . And I know it's another Audi . Andi , I seem to be doing a lot of videos recently without it , but it's all thanks to Watford Audi who are providing me with the access of cars which hopefully I'm gonna be able to explore a lot more with BMW . Maybe potentially many and a few other cars other than just Audi . But I'm tryingto sort of sharpened my tools in terms of being able to review cars so that when I've been given much more access tow vehicles , just Ferrari Lamborghini . When I turned 25 then hopefully oh , have a more refined review style car here , as you can see in 2015 Audi T two liter .#### #### ####[([52], [117, 118], 'POS'), ([133], [24, 130, 131], 'POS'), ([52], [125, 126], 'POS')]

You will find Dole 12.3 inch color touchscreen display Is one of them being the gauges , of course , but writing center it is touch screen voice activated .

You will get Apple Carplay with a one year free trial . Their factory navigation again is going to come standard on the X seven , and you can check out your weather settings if you want T o . I found that pretty nice . And of course , the rating is sending zzzz well . And when it comes to the sound system , by the way standards set up , it's gonna give you a high five sound system with 10 speakers , 205 watts . If you want with the premium pack , you are going to get a Harman Kardon surround sound system with that , give me 12 speakers and 360 watts . Last sound system Set up available is a Bowers and Wilkins Diamond Surround sound system for 4200 . That's going to give you 20 speakers and 1500 watts and to date , in the 350 ish cars I've reviewed that is still my favorite sound system , by the way .

The other interesting thing about this car , quite frankly , is that when it goes on sale , it will only be available in the all wheel drive version . I think that's because all wheel drive is becoming an essential component of luxury . People looking over the drive cars and they say That's a luxurious car , so Mercedes-Benz the decision , even though it's more expensive . But they're gonna introduce this car in both the 304 100 in America with initially on Lee all wheel drive for Matic .#### #### ####[([28], [26, 27], 'NEU'), ([28, 29], [2], 'POS'), ([6], [57], 'POS')]

DIT gives a pretty good account of itself . Now it's impossible to do 64 mpg , and if I look down but the trick computer , it says I'm doing 150 which is actually not bad at all . Also , this engine can get from north 62 miles an hour in just 7.7 seconds if you go for the excellent seven speed S tronic automatic gearbox , and that's because it has a launch control function , something engaging now . To do that , I put the car into SP sport mode . The drive selected a dynamic the gearbox into the sport setting . Hold on the break for the thrall , release the brake well spent because it is a very slippery service that would have affected the time .

As you can see , if you want to carry items in the boot and I need a bit more space , you can ask your rear passengers sit more of pride because it does increase the low capacity . But people really don't wanna travel like that . Aren't they really , she carrying really large items you're gonna need to fold the seats down and to do it . A two stage process , which is a bit of a fast these days for these seat backs . They do lie flat . The problem is that you have this huge ridge here . Now it's gonna be really hard to push heavy items right to the front of the car . Now let's talk about the actual boot space , so this door opens sideways , so it's really awkward to do in tight spaces . Also , it's really heavy because you got that spare with on the back of this There , you got the quilting here . That's really nice now . What's not so nice , though , is the fact that you really do have to kind of lift things up quite a way to get them into this . Because unlike a Range Rover , there's no air suspension , so you can't lower the car down to make that easier . Also , the tow hitch it's fixed . It's not retractable once again , like it's retractable on a Range Rover that we can still toe the same 3.5 tons . This car's that's pretty good , but also pretty good is that there's no lower lip . So once you've got things appear , there is enough to slide in on this very tender points around the place . You got 12 volt socket here as well . You've also got a boot liner there to keep it nice and clean . Z8 don't dirty the carpet . Unfortunately , under there , there's no extra storage , which is annoying because really , you could do is somewhere to put the removable parcel shelf . So now it's just kind of lay like that . Maybe I see what's going on because I want to show you the boot size yet . It's very big , but it's not quite as big as a Porsche Cayenne . You might be wondering what the heck this bag is . Well , actually , more on that later in the video is the last thing I wanna point out . Is this this national guttering around the roof ? So what ? It's raining that could get filled it with water .

it's called a mid cycle refresh , basically , when a manufacturer changes up a car in the mid part of its life with a new front grille , new engine output and that is exactly what Audi has done with the A6 , the S6 and , of course , the S7 .

But either way , there's a lot of amenity . So their second row passengers , including with the premium package , get rear electric side window shades .

Yes , I can verify that it does indeed feel lighter , uh , less weight means better economy and combined with the revised engines a new cuatro ultra or will drive , which can decouple the rear wheels when cruising to boost efficiency .

So those of us who saw the very last episode of Top Gear on the BBC that Jeremy Clarkson evidence may remember that he did review this car and he reviewed it very positively , absolutely loved it on one of things he did during that review was he stopped at a motorway .

You can park it there or you can park it here . If you park this car there , you've got to stretch this wire right across the bonnet and make a huge drama out of something that's essentially very , very simple . If you park it here , you don't stretch . You just put it in there . You plug it in , you switch it on and it charges .

And then when it comes to comfort while this causing the adaptive dampers and they're available from £750 actually in the end sport version , they're just in the 500 you gotta have because you put the car in comfort mode and it deals with bumps very , very well put in sport if you want to , which makes a firmer and stop the car .

Right Wants to know . How does the sound enhancement work ? Sound enhancement ? Eso There's two things in this car . Sport . Exhaust . So it has a different centre sound , sir , which changes the tone . A little bit more of a mechanical sound to the exhaust . And now I'm gonna put it in dynamic mode and those baffles open . Oh yeah , And then on the RS5 under 3000 rpm , there's a diaphragm that sits at the base of fire , will buy the windshield that then takes the engine noise and simply amplifies a little bit to give you some more noise and uses the windshield essentially like a speaker like the windshield speaker . But it's only under 3000 under 3000 . Give the turbo six little bit more grunt , and it's not that we're pumping any sound into the speakers of the car . Anything is just amplifying the engine noise using a diaphragm at the base the windshield . Douglas Milosevski . He wants to know . Why can't I get a manual ? Only A8 V8 automatic .

And when you do it with an automatic and the manual is a little bit of your limitation I mean , I would love a manual , but unfortunately , the minority it's minority of people who would actually buy one .

It's still exactly the same . 444 brake horse power is in the outgoing , naturally aspirated V8 , which is odd . You might think that's strange . New car . Gin up the performance , However , on Bear with Me on this engine has actually downside . Now we shouldn't be too surprised that just because that's the way the world is going and die , Hi RS5 fans might be huffing and puffing and going . What is going on with the world , however , with the downsizing in engine capacity , is the upsizing in talk . And that is where turbo tech , really , where that twisting power that you get from talk is what we feel through our receptacles as a human , it's all about talk . That's what gives us that feeling of thrust when we mash our foot on the right hand pedal . So this car is actually up by £125 feet of tour , a very similar figure to its brake horsepower , is pushing out £443 feet of torque and 444 brake horsepower . Now that might not seem a great deal . But honestly , upon dropping a cog in this eight speed automatic gearbox will get on to that shortly . The talk is wonderful . I wouldn't say it's exactly organ bending , but the main thing is the Quattro system puts it down with the traction off a sticky J C B . It's like they're just gonna put superglue on some tracks and it's it to the asphalt . It's got so much traction . The great thing about downsizing and an engine in my eyes is mostly about downsizing the weight . So with two less cylinders smaller engine smaller .

Now , the way Audi he's done that has got this four litre V8 twin turbo charged diesel engine . It's got sequential turbo , so one gets going early than an exhaust valve opens . A certain reds on the other Turbo kicks into , but from low revs . It has an electrically operated compressor , no electric turbocharger because it because it's not doing what it does . But it's doing compressing . It's chucking in the air because it's electric and it spins up very quickly from north to 70,000 rpm mean 1/4 of a second . I believe that means there is almost no Audi says , almost no turbo lag . Well , quite shocking the gearbox across into manual mode and leave it there and then go from very low ribs . I put my foot down . There is acceleration in a manner that you just don't get in a turbocharged car . Turbo charges just spit back quickly in response to throw numbers . They just don't do it . Was it 48 votes ? Well , to get enough power , so you're gonna have to increase The current switch . Can't do because you love with massively thick cables . Or you have to increase the voltage , which you could do by families . There's a four liter V eight engine in the front , so if you want to generate some power , you can so as well as the normal 12 of battery . This car also has a 48 volt lithium ion battery in the boot . Audi also uses it in uncoupling to go in a straight line . This S8 Q7 has loose anti robots . And then , as you turn a corner , it uses a 48 volt resistance motor effectively to tighten things up and really minimized body roll . Bentley Bentayga does exactly the same .

Speaking of Dry Train , What I hope is gonna come next is potentially an upgraded gearbox now , when the car launched and I've always been somewhat of a gearbox snob .

So that's one for the car gates and I want for the families is the fact that this car's boot is pretty large , actually , a standard . You get an automated tailgate . Now the size of it is actually quite a bit bigger than that of a Range Rover sport , and it's a little bit bigger than that that you'll find in a BMW X6 now a bit of a load lip to lift stuff across . That's not too much of a problem . What's problem or oven issue is the fact that the boot is quite shallow . Just hurt the opening because of these sloped rear . Don't have such a problem on the Q7 , which is square at the back end . So if you try and laid things like upright or pack it right to the rafters , the boot doesn't like it . Much as you can see now , it's all . But though there's plenty of space in here , it's a nice square shape . Otherwise , you got things like a 12 up socket there , which is good for plugging in a vacuum to clean out the boot . With this bits and pieces storage into here along with the tire repair kit , there's no spare wheel on this particular car . Got here starts in various things in here . On look this specific netted areas , which is ideal for your organic spinach and love . This one's ideal for celery . How cool is that in this ? Um , tethering points here , and I like the fact you've got these led lights there , which help illuminate the boot . Now , if you want to carry larger items , you can't just do it from here . You have to walk around to the seats because that's where you fold them down here at the seat basis and they just snapped into place would be careful with this one . It's spring loaded , smacked in the head closes door . It is a bit of fat women to do that and also look load space isn't completely flat . It's a bit implying there , but it's not too bad .

Let's finally move on to the Audi Dr selected that you get within the Audi A one and this is something that I really wasn't expecting from this car because it is the base level . Smallest little Audi . They still put their drive selected on both A3 systems , but it doesn't make sense . All three systems make a huge difference to the card . I just wasn't expecting so efficiency mode basically cuts the engine . If you're coasting , it changes gear early . It probably uses less than the engine , meaning you get better mpg . So for the long distances , this car is perfect , and I have mentioned previously in this video that I do use it around town . Quiet , however , coming up to a junction coasting into a junction , which I do quite off it cuts the power on DDE has a little think about whether it wants to turn back on or not . So the only down side are saying to this car is blinis inefficiency mode . Driving into a junction , for example , you're cruising into a roundabout , and you're looking to the right to see if any cars coming . No cars are coming . The engine's already cut off , so you have to put your foot on the accelerator for a couple of seconds before it realizes that you want to engage the engine again , and that's when you get the power back . So there has been a few times that I've sort of being caught in limbo all around about gun . Where's the calyx ? The efficiency mode is very , very good , but I would probably stick to using it on long journeys soon . Did you pick into dynamic , which I have been doing already ?

Audi has created a very bespoke experience in the new , eh ? What is this Spoke mean ? It just means unique and custom . Basically , there are seven different profiles that you can choose from that customized 400 different features of the car . Everything from what kind of besides you want how you want your temperature settings to where you want your seat , where you want your steering wheel , the normal stuff . Plus , of course , all the things that you could do with a car with air suspension so you can have different Dr Select from comfort to dynamic the sport and the newest feature . That's very akin to if you know Mercedes-Benz class are electric doors so unheard open door . All you have to do is just gently upon the handle and the door opens . Who , of course , to close it , just gently close it in the door . Does the rest of the work perhaps the coolest feature of this Audi are these events that now close and open kind of has a way of greeting you when you walk into the car incredibly silent and they're incredibly cool ? And you may be thinking to yourself , You know , the Jaguar accepted that a long time ago , and I suspect the guys that Audi would tell you that the Volkswagen fate on did it even before the Jaguar . But it is a cool party . Trick and event not only kind of reclines into the dashboard , but the piece of wood then closes to give you one giant and , I think very elegant , beautiful bit of wood . One of my favorite features is , of course , Google Earth . And check this out . Of course , you can zoom in , or if you want , you can zoom out . I can show you actually where we are right there . There's the Pacific and there's PCH won the Pacific Coast Highway . They're not one , not two . But now , in fact , three different screens that air customizable that do everything from control how the seats missiles you to Senate air coming into the cabin too . Of course , your music , your navigation And , of course , a lot of other features . So let me have Anthony tell you and show you what thes three different screens can actually accomplish . So it's pretty configurable , right ? You've got this screen you can configure so you can put you could put for instance , you're right Now you've got your speedometer , and your rpm's very small , but you can make a bigger right , Sure , and so you can set it up . But if you want the you don't need If you're around home , you don't want your map up there or you you'd rather have your your media playing your radio . You can have the large gauges that you're used to on dhe . You know , out here you could put your map if you wanted to just have an idea where you are and you can , you know , we've brought with this new generation , the gesture control , just like you'd expect from a tablet on . Then if you decide all , I'd rather have my radio stations here in the center on and the math over here , you can reverse it . So it's really set up that you can set the car up the way you like it . And now with the new generation of A8 , we have profiles so that when you get in the car , the the car will ask , Is Anthony my car ? I'm gonna get in . It's gonna say , driver profile , Anthony , Is this you ? If it's not , you can scroll down , right when you get in the car goes the next profile , and then it will set up to 400 different settings within the car . So when I get out of the car when I'm done today , it's gonna memorize . That's the way Anthony wanted the car set up . And next time I get in , if my wife had the car and she had a different profile , When I get in , I can switch it to Anthony . The car just changes all around . It changes the presets and the shortcuts that you have the icons that the way . It's all set up here in the M M I . The ambient lighting color , the temperature , the driver , assistant settings , everything . And these are the types of things . As you drive the car , you will set this up and I'm set it and forget it . And then and it can all come back to the way you like it if someone else is driving or if you share a car . So the profiles are a really powerful way of , of kind of customizing and making a car familiar to you . Every time you get it , you can set it up in your profile that you get a fragrance you have winter or summer fragments of the car smells good when you get out of there with one of the friends of the fragrances air in here in the H faxes system . Here , you you have him on there's a nine isar a cz wells . The fragrance it's that's in here , and you can set which fragrance you want with Winter summer and how subtle we haven't set on light . Just it's something . It's really a preference , and we didn't want it to be too strong . You're smart phone When you put your finger over it , it's gonna execute that command based on the heat There , I can see I'm driving along . I want to make a phone call . I'm focused on the road to put my finger here . All I see orange in my proof revision I want I know phone is green . I wanted the phones and I put my finger , I see the green and then I give it a push . And so that way you'll have the deliberate command executed , not the one that your finger went to first . So , you know , touch screens have been around for a little while , but most of them , when you put your finger over him , it's gonna execute that . And then and then you can add frustration because you're driving . We want you focused on the road and I put my finger in between . Phone is on so I can push that . So that's literally away toe . Take some of the stress out of the driving , takes on the cognitive load off and make it a bit more intuitive . And just like the previous A8 , we've got this fixed place for your wrist so that you can control everything before we had 35 buttons . Now we've gotten rid of the only time . I don't need to write anything here right now . Why would we ? Right , You're not just for fun while I want to put a navigation destination , and now I'm gonna put this in . Now it transforms to , ah , writing pad on me , and you get some tips in here . The first time is a brand new car . So it gives you these tips , Um , and then down below , we have natural handwriting recognition . In the past , you had to write block letters . Now you can write left to right or right on top , So Okay , well , look for Starbucks . Um , that's the one that everyone loves to look for . And then it has . Now , we're going to a cloud to do the points of interest . And if I don't want Starbucks now very easily , you just scroll and get rid of that . Or if I'd rather put it in with the keyboard , just touching the corner . Starbucks . You can also , um , right directly on top handwriting so I can do just right on top . Still find it left . Right ? So it's really a big upgrade . in the in the way you can interact with the car .#### #### ####[([6], [4, 5], 'POS'), ([6], [22], 'POS'), ([6], [24], 'POS'), ([42], [31], 'POS'), ([42], [39], 'POS'), ([126], [125], 'NEU'), ([126], [112, 113], 'POS'), ([180], [173], 'POS'), ([180], [7, 23, 34, 129, 154, 196, 824], 'POS'), ([180], [200, 205], 'POS'), ([45], [205, 254], 'POS'), ([258], [8, 197, 263, 266], 'POS'), ([272], [279], 'NEU'), ([272], [4, 285], 'POS'), ([272], [287], 'POS'), ([302, 303], [295], 'POS'), ([302, 303], [7, 35, 315], 'POS'), ([302, 303], [35, 308, 315], 'POS'), ([366], [31, 364], 'POS'), ([366], [369], 'POS'), ([42], [403, 405], 'POS'), ([366], [429, 430], 'POS'), ([60], [31, 40], 'NEU'), ([45], [8, 34, 35, 190, 479, 481, 568], 'POS'), ([32], [31], 'POS'), ([32], [722], 'POS'), ([32], [43, 190, 875, 882], 'POS'), ([32], [34, 45, 61, 884, 887], 'POS'), ([919], [920], 'POS'), ([909], [35, 479], 'POS'), ([909], [3, 606, 993], 'POS'), ([437, 1117], [43, 308, 861, 1187, 1191], 'POS'), ([437, 1117], [1197, 1200, 1201, 1202], 'POS'), ([437, 1117], [288, 1208, 1209], 'POS'), ([1236], [43, 1240, 1241], 'NEU'), ([45], [9, 1310], 'POS'), ([1292, 1293], [1330, 1331, 1332], 'POS')]

Which , of course , is always on my mind . Driving this car and gone from the box and Astro , it probably got about 500 miles to a tank , and it costs about 65 70 quid to fill up . Where is this ? I'll get about 300 miles to a tank , but it cost me 100 £4 you saw when I epically failed the first fuel stop .

Explain how this system works so you can have the court in a recuperation mode . And what that does is you're just basically rolling , but it's slowing your slightly because you've got the regenerative braking working .

If you want that region breaking to be more severe , you pull that paddle again , and I'll give you even greater recuperation . Now what you can do if you get a little bit too quickly because this is steep down there , you might need to use the brakes , and then you apply the brake pedal on up to a certain level of breaking .

I'm really thankful for for that . I think if you're buying into an RS4 odd Acct definitely wanted to suggest that the car is a little bit more aggressive .

Work also helps when maneuvering is the steering because it's very , very light or so you don't have to turn the wheel . That much was all illustrate . Now to Ggo A4 steering lock lock that's full steering lock . And so it does just make it so much easier to weave about the place . Also , like this feature , the fact that the guest lecture is here on the steering column safer going reverse and then to drive it's right at your fingertips is great . Not just makes it nice and easy and effortless , which is what this court should be now for most of the time , the suspension is brilliant . It's almost as though you're flying up the road , but a bit like when you're flying occasionally you do hit a bit of turbulence because the odd shop can catch and you get a lot . A jolt for the cabin is just surprises you . Now , if you don't want to , speed comes to surprise . You get that magic body control because it makes its call go for them like they're not there . The gearbox is really smooth and relaxing as well . It just lends the gears together . You wouldn't know it has nine ratios . You can hardly feel it changing unless it's suddenly floor the throttle , and then it changes pretty quickly to get a move on .#### #### ####[([7], [10, 10, 13], 'POS'), ([7, 35], [38], 'NEU'), ([77, 78], [76], 'POS'), ([7, 75], [89], 'POS'), ([82], [97], 'POS'), ([82], [99], 'POS'), ([82], [95], 'POS'), ([116], [118], 'POS'), ([116], [60, 125], 'POS'), ([200], [202, 203], 'POS'), ([200], [205], 'POS'), ([200], [44, 226, 227, 229], 'POS'), ([200], [241, 242], 'POS')]

The steering is absolutely brimming with feedback . It feels like a completely different car compared to a standard e class from the period . Now , the four speed automatic transmission is a little bit dull witted , but once you found the engine up , it still feels properly fast . This was the first Mercedes-Benz fitted as standard with ASR traction control .

Well , let's find out . Let's go for a ride together and see how this car differs from the previous generation . I can immediately tell you that it feels and drives a lot bigger .

This is more of , Ah , almost e class size car than a C Class . But that's okay because , well , obviously , this does compete with A3 Siri's . They're very different cars . A3 Siri's .

Um , we'll share fits in who will , which is another borders for me because it's quite time consuming , taking it apart and putting it back together on the brilliant thing about this , too , is that it has the buttons here . If you do need to push the seats down , you're gonna stretch in . It does have buttons on the top . There they are . Electronic . If I press that button here .

That just makes this car feel a bit more sporting . A bit more coop a like let's talk about the driving tech fit to this car . So , as you can see , it has lain . Keeping assessed so well actually steer the court to keep in lane , and when you combine that with the radar laser guided cruise control , which can keep you safe distance from the car in front of this car come pretty much drive itself . Also , it uses all the sensors around the car to get feel what's going on around it . So if you suddenly go through roadworks , it can still navigate through the lanes . Obviously , you can't drive for too long with the hands off the wheel . It will throw a wobbly and tell you to put hands back on . That's what it's doing now .

Then there's ride quality . The suspension isn't softly sprung . You'll definitely feel the road . But all the unpleasant harshness has been deftly subdued in normal driving . The ride is lovely , but when the moment strikes the Q7 corners with tenacious grip , an impressive body control like what I'm doing right now , all the while steering with delightful directness , you have to drive a car that would carry around a litter of children . Maze will be fun going with the standard Audi Dr Select Controller alters the dampers , steering , throttle and transmission towards sporting or comfort oriented settings .

Hopefully , the way the new X5 drives is enough to make up for this mold and winds , so the X 50 d has its own unique suspension set up . It's got coil springs with adaptive dampers . Andi .

Bums doesn't jump around too much . Just went over there . I could hardly feel it . Press this button put into sport , and then it adds weight to the steering improves the throttle response . It's different at the suspension . On it adds a bit of a fruit stand exhaust . You know what A8 in sport , the Roy doesn't seem really much worse . It's very , very good . This one actually has the active anti roll bars proper with side , which would normally lean down to stop the car rolling so much in the corners . And it does . It feels really sporting agile you at the same time , really strong , sturdy on a bit of a beast . Taxi drive . It's great . I think they've got it spot on . They have blended comfort with performance brilliantly . With this car , steering is a highlight . If you compare this thing like an Audi cue aides , which has doing this a little bit kind of dead . This does feel like it's connected to the front wheels onto the road so you can tell what's going on . One thing I will complain about those that change modes . You have to ridge between the two front seats on feely , away to the buttons . They end up looking down . When you want to go in sport , when really you want to look at the road , not down here .

But so then , as you can probably imagine , judging by the trim levels there , there are two different engines set ups available for the X seven first , one being the three litre , twin power turbocharged inline six cylinder that is gonna belong to the extra F40 I that we have today . That one puts out 335I horsepower 5500 rpm and 330I pound feet of torque available at 1500 rpm . Power is going to be sent to all four wheels through BMW ex drive . All wheel drive system . That power is sent of ground through an eight speed automatic with paddle shifters , which we will test out a little bit . Here , 0 to 60 time BMW puts it out approximately 5.8 seconds , with mpg numbers coming in a 20 in the city , 25 on the highway , and the X seven will give you an auto start . Stop system is well , so when you're stopped , a stops on or red light S7 will turn off automatically for you . Saving a little mpg is there as well , but the other engines set up along into the extra 50 I that is going to be a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged V8 , this one putting out 456 horsepower around 5200 rpm , £479 feet of torque available at 1500 rpm again sent all four wheels to an eight speed automatic . But on this 10 to 65.2 seconds , which is crazy for a three row SUV , by the way , and mpg numbers coming in at 17 city 22 highway . And so before we do any kind of acceleration in the X seven . I did want to mention there are some Dr moves located just behind the shifter there , and they're going to include ICO pro comfort sport and adaptive , which is really where the car decides what driving mood is best for your particular situation . But they're going to just things like the shift points . The Ronald response and the steering sensitivity is , Well , it's so . But now , having said that , let's put the shifter all the way to the back into the left that is going to give you that manual shift mode . If you wanted it that let's do a quick little acceleration test with the paddle shifters .

we know that the Mercedes SL s is a thing off deep , deep joy . We've run one for 10,000 miles this year , and we absolutely adore it . We also know that it's a much softer car than similarly priced rivals such as the Ferrari 458 Italia on the McLaren MP for 12 . See , it's more of a GT car , much less focused .

One option you may want , though , is adjustable lumbar support for your back because it doesn't come a standard , which is a little bit odd , because this kind of price especially get things like electric steering column . There is absolutely loads of adjustment in it . In fact , this new G class is actually longer , wider and taller than the old one . It means there's loads more space here in the front , and even if you're small , you can really jack up the seat to get good view out . There's still plenty of head room , if you really told you can go lower . But what's it like in the back ? Because the old Carl was absolutely terrible ? Well , one thing I will point out is the fact the rear doors don't open all that wise . It can be a bit . Or could any first light training maneuver charts see ? And thankfully , though , the eyes are fixed points of really easy to get out there exposed , that's no problem . It's more of a problem . Once again , he's getting it right . As you can see , though , once you're in Oh my gosh , loads of head room . You could be well over six foot tall . You'll be fine . Knee room is decent as well . Now you can stretch your feet out some way , but then there's like a thing underneath the front seat that you can't go any further . So that's it . It's not fully like a limousine in the back , but it's comfy enough on . I can't complain about this . Look . Huge rear windows . The ledge is low , so kids were built to say very easily . Also , there's big windows just behind you , which helped make it feel like near in here . Despite all the black trim of this particular car , makes you think that this is gonna be a seven seater . But no , it's not . It's a strict five seater . Now , if you want to carry five once , it's doable because his car is so wide . Yes , the middle seat is a little bit harder and raised up in the outer , too . But the floor's pretty flat . There's loads of room for everyone's feet . You can carry three people in the back here , no problem at all .

I have driven the brand new smart car which feels a little bit wobbly . And when you're on the motorways and going over 60 miles an hour , however , this car , it actually has quite good fear . When you're driving on this road , it feels planted . It doesn't actually get affected too much by the weather around and driving at 70 75 miles an hour with whatever the weather . This car absolutely nails the long drives which I really wasn't expecting from this car . I didn't test drive this car before I bought it . I just kind of hoped for the best . And the smart car was for me , a car that was fantastic around the city , but pretty rubbish on the motorways . Where is this car ? It does both absolutely brilliantly on even just driving around these lovely coastal roads . It really grips the road quite well . I've got inefficiency , but once you put it in dynamic in the car Sol spices up a little bit . I can pad early up , go down the gears on this car , becomes a lot of fun . And I'll tell you what . One of my favorite journeys that I had was driving up to Lincoln , which is a lot of motorway miles on this car , handled it perfectly . The fuel economy was ridiculous , is about 60 mpg .

But more often than not , there's a delay between the time you depress the paddle shifter and when the mechanical shift occurs .

One of the things that when I first started doing fully charged , I just driven the cars I had . I didn't really know much about it . I hadn't driven a lot of other vehicles .

Even with either set up , that you go with the power plant is going to be the same . Powering this one is a 4.4 liter twin power turbocharged be eight engine putting out 600 horsepower , 5700 rpm , £553 feet of torque available at a very wide power band , actually from 1857 100 rpm .

We will be testing out the paddle shifters than a little bit here . But when you put all that together 0 to 60 time for this standard M5 comes in at 3.2 seconds . This is a family sedan that could hit 60 in 3.2 . That is just ridiculous . And as you can imagine , it gets better with the M5 competition . That's gonna add 17 horsepower , giving you a 0 to 60 time of 3.1 top speed 190 miles per hour . If you wanted to test it out on the Autobahn in case you were curious , mpg numbers come into approximately 15 in the city , 21 on the highway with auto start stop functionality .

Fixed to this homed in tone sheet metal is a lighter , more rigid chassis that allows for some brilliant suspension Tuning . Conventional wisdom would suggest that a true luxury sedan must sacrifice a measure of handling performance in the name of comfort . Not sure exactly how Audi pulled it off , but the A4 cuatro simultaneously groups like a vice and rides like a proper luxury cruiser . And then there's the steering has a certifiable steering snob . I have to say the A4 is after my own heart . The waiting is spot on at every speed , especially on the highway , where it's so well calibrated . It fuels , is it The car becomes Maur stable , the further you straight from the speed limit that we don't condone such an action .#### #### ####[([20, 21], [12, 19], 'POS'), ([120], [30, 31], 'POS'), ([75], [8, 95, 97, 98], 'POS'), ([75], [110, 111, 112], 'POS'), ([56], [89, 90, 91, 92], 'POS')]

The M 7 60 ally has some styling changes over the normal seven series to make it stand out , such as more aggressive and deeper from bumpers .

You can get there seven series with a little boot lips spoiler , which is a bit unusual and then low down . You got deeper rear bumper again on what you got .

That's just 4.5 seconds , which is quicker than Audi claims . S8 really is a proper wolf in sheep's clothing because while you go about performance for most of the time you're just cruising along its release today , it's as comfy as a big woolly jumper , so this car has the adaptive dampers . The magnetic ride is about nine inch put extra , but it's worth having it , because when you put the car into comfort mode , it slackens them off , and then it deals nicely with bumps on you can Putin around on down actually averaging 30 team Mossberg Alan , which is pretty impressive , really . And I think it's definitely worth spending the extra 1500 quid to get the automatic gearbox because it just takes a strain of everyday life . Commuting on you can change gears yourself if you want using the paddles or if you're just cruising on the motorway , that's really need to overtake . Someone responds really quickly . Yeah , and you're back to being a wolf again . And then what happens if you encounter a twisty road ? Well , you can put the car into dynamic to stiffen up . The suspension also adds weight to the steering , makes exhaust louder on the gearbox shift a bit faster on consuming how wet it is . This thing corners and very , very well , so when the front we'll start to slip , such as they were denied a front wheel drive car . It can send power to the rear to push you out the corner , and it just grips and goes like a good . It's more fun in the old M3 , which felt totally inert . But still , I don't think you feel quite as much as you do in a golf . I it doesn't feel quite , is adjustable . You lift off the throttle , make corner , but still most people most of the time cruising around this is gonna be great for them .#### #### ####[([26], [17, 18, 19, 20], 'POS'), ([34], [46, 47], 'POS'), ([58, 59], [69, 70], 'POS'), ([80, 81], [71, 84, 86], 'POS'), ([94], [91, 92], 'POS'), ([130, 131], [65, 69, 122], 'POS'), ([130, 131], [29, 30, 135, 137, 139, 140], 'POS'), ([131], [13, 171, 173], 'POS'), ([205], [207, 208], 'NEU'), ([205, 217], [213, 214], 'NEU'), ([205, 220], [221], 'NEU'), ([131, 205, 225], [15, 227, 228], 'POS'), ([238], [197, 240, 240], 'POS'), ([262], [8, 290, 291, 295], 'POS'), ([34, 99], [352], 'POS')]

How it'll plays together on this one is the BMW I three Rex with the range extended little petrol engine in the back that is almost impossible to hear when it's on . You just don't know when it's on or off unless you're going at four miles an hour and then you can hear it stops , and it's just a little like a motorbike engine that's turning a generator that's generating enough power to keep the batteries at whatever level there at when it turns on . And that , I think , is an interesting transition , like a transition drug if you like from people who are totally used to fossil fuel cars on , then want to try an electric one , but they get over . What happens if it runs out on a lane at night , which you get most Maur People run out of petrol than anyone knows . There's been a big flurry of activity around because there's all these signs on motorways that go check your fuel level because so many people are running out of fuel on motorways all the time . Do they have range anxiety They do when they stall in the fast lane ?

Another thing you got to think about is whether you want the car with front wheel drive or four wheel drive . Now most people would be fine with front wheel drive to tell you the truth , but I think the cultural will drive system just makes it feel a little bit more grippy on dhe . Easier to hustle down a back road . Let's move on to the actual suspension because there's four choices of suspension in this car , ma'am . Oh my God , it's just so confusing . You have comfort or sport normal suspension or comfort on sport adaptive . Now I would go for one of the adaptive because they are better and probably comfort adaptive , because you can still firm that one up by pressing a button in point into sports mode . But when you have in comfort , it's super super waffle . Very , very comfy , though . To be fair , the normal comfort suspension is reasonably enough .

Before we get too breathless with our praise , there is an issue of usability . While beautifully arranged . Actually , using these controls can be a little bit tricky .
