So definitely an amazing gauge set up there and by the way , to control what is on that gauge set up since it is all digital .

It is sporty , but not fast . If you understand what I mean by that character of the car is more of a relaxed grand tour .

Okay , those are the essentials , but what's it like to drive from a dynamic perspective ? The eye three drives like a BMW .

Now , though , it's time to hit the road to see what the interview X5 . On the whole , this big Dave X5 drives really really nicely .

For now , One of the things that makes it much more nimble than it should be is the fact that it has dynamic rear wheel steering . So not only do the front wheel steer , but the back wheel steer is well , and that has to benefits first and foremost . When you're on a curvy road , it allows the car thio more accurately carve a corner because the rear wheels are also steering . And , of course , perhaps that the biggest and most noticeable difference between a regular front wheel steer car , all wheel steer cars that gives you much tighter turning radius .

It has a three liter inline six cylinder engine petrol engine , which is very smooth because inline six under engines are naturally perfectly balanced . But on top of that , it has one twin scroll turbocharger two on electric compressor Electric Turbo . If you want to call that electric supercharger , if you want to give it that name , that primary there to fill the talk gap in the turbo lag from the turbocharger . But then also on top of that , it also has what they call Ik ik . U Books don't want point to the back . It's actually in between the engine and the gearbox . The E Q . Is hey started about two slash alternator . It adds another 20 or horse power to the engines 425 or so , but it also adds some £120 for a talk , which is a lot . Anyway , all of those three things combined , and it's really complicated this right because the air goes in , it goes around against through the turbo charger , but then it could get sucked down by the electric compressor before it's even gone through the normal thing and it comes back just It's complicated , right ? Some companies you would trust to get that right . I think Mercedes-Benz M5 the time it's gone through all of that . It's gone through the boost e electric bit as well , then drives through a nine speed automatic gearbox primarily to the rear wheels , and it goes to the front wheels when they lose grip .

This architecture is so flexible it can be used to underpin anything from a super Millie right through to an executive saloon , and it will be used in the vast majority of the W group models in the future .

The standard fit rear end differential could move power about between the back wheels descended the wheel with the most grip for improved corner exiting traction . Now , while the old M5 years a deal clutch automatic gearbox , this one has an eight speed with a tall converter , which may make it seem about as modern as this mountain bike . But the reason they've gone for a talk converter is that it's smoother , and it's strong enough to cope with this car's extra talk . The engine has a special high pressure oil system , which works in high G conditions . So when you're calling really faster that you don't get oil starvation and damaged the engine , you better put your cap back . Otherwise , I may actually damage the engine .

Now let's talk about this entertainment system because A8 serious gets the latest version of BMW's I drive so you can operate it by touching it . You can use voice commands by going , Hey , BMW , what's the time ? It is 14 58 . You can also control it by gesture . So , yeah , if I do that , come on . There we go . I can wave my hand about and control certain things on dhe . I do use it for the volume . Onda , like Hey , can skip trucks by going on . That's it . Recognizing my jester , that's quite good fun . It's nice to use on some way . He seems a bit more intuitive than actually pressing a button on the steering wheel to do it . There are more functions than in previous BMWs , but it's not too confusing the hell out the many , just as you want it as it's customizable . If you want , you can use the old fashioned swivel well , which is actually pretty good when you're driving along . It's nice and easy to operate , and you could just wait three different menus and just activate different things . So it's good . They've retained that unlike Audi , which has got rid of this with the world control and just come fully touch screen , which isn't such a good idea . You can use the entertainment system to control all the cards major functions and can do things like or to the color of the interior ambient lighting , which is standard on this car . There's not too many colors to choose from , but there's enough . You gotta think about Blue Green , but I think it just looks better with orange to match the exterior paint . It's pretty cool . Also have various online app , so you can do things like check the weather or the news . And there's even a concierge service where you can contact someone at BMW for help with the car or taxi program . You're certain of remotely instead , simple . My only major real problem with this entertainment system is the fact that when you have Apple carplay , there is no android auto , so I can't connect my phone to it , and I'd like to . Still , the screen is very sharp . The graphics look good on the map is really responsive when you try and move it around . Now let's move on to the digital drivers display , which I don't think it's quite a successful as those in an Audi or a Mercedes so part . The reason is that it's all quite dark . It doesn't quite the functionality , either . You get in the other German cars as well , so you can choose different views . And things are . But it's not quite extensive . Also , not a big fan of the rev counter game backwards . Now they've done that so that the freedom space in the middle for the satnav , unfortunately , is no that clear . One thing I will point out , though , is I like the fact they have the little graphic of the car , and it showed in the color that you have the car , which is a nice touch . The specifications on this car is really , really good as standard in the UK we get there sport version , which has a ll the kit you really need . Finally , let's talk about the cubby spaces because they do matter if you're gonna be in a grand tour . A crossing continents . So the door bins along , but not really very wide . So I could just about squeeze that intuit . The glove box is so safe the manual does take of a bit of space beacon away . Really , because you have the manual installed on the court entertainment system . So just use that one instead . Under here , you do have quite a bit of space , and you've got your USB C . Now , what is that ? Your species socket there to plug in . The mobile device is also under here . You have a normal USB socket so you can plug in your phone system there as well . And there's a little pad there for Wallace charging for your mobile phone or to charge the cause . Kay , you got a couple of cup holders here . Why ? Any problem in the Cup holders is that this part of the cover just hangs over the top of its gonna be careful not to catch your coffee cup when you're lifting , acting much , spill it everywhere .

And I think that comes with a lot of supercars , especially the Lamborghini Gallardo . They start in the center console on this bit , is really high and makes a really nice arm rest . Ah , nde . Unlike the R8 , you don't actually have to compromise using one of your cup holders to use it as an arm rest . If you remember my cup holders in the R8 right down the middle , you he's using his cup holders or used it as an arm rest .

All right , now that the X5 is on its tippy toes , I've got a better approach departure break over angle and I couldn't go up this hill , and I can demonstrate the third thing that this vehicle does well and that is site because it does have a full 360 degree camera along me to actually see over the top of that hill . Because when I'm driving and going up that hill , all I see a sky and I don't know what is on the other side of that . And if this was the BMW course , if we're in , let's say Moab , there could be nothing but a 20 foot drop . But this way I could only see . So let's see how good this camera is . So I'm gonna turn on the front facing camera , and one of the cool things that I can do now is I can see what's over the hill , because if I'm looking straight ahead , I don't see anything but sky . But in the camera I can actually see what's in front of me . So I know that there is no 20 foot drop off straight ahead of me . So when I crest on the top of this hill , I'm confident in knowing that I will not go plunging to a fiery death and record very expensive new BMW X5 in the process . And obviously cameras are something that now all vehicles have both on and off road . But this one is relatively high definition in . It seems to do a really good job and kind of telling me what is ahead of me . On the love front . Facing cameras went off roading .

But what I'm interested in , as regular viewers will be aware is whether actually makes any difference to its fuel consumption . The official fuel consumption figures for this vehicle are 134 miles to the gallon . How realistic is that ? I mean , it doesn't seem very realistic . A lot of people I spoke to use it to literally for their daily commute , but they don't use any petrol it all on . In fact , the petrol tank in this car is especially sealed petrol tank because petrol goes off if you don't use it . So they've had to redesigned the petrol tank to enable it to be have a tank full of petrol for a few weeks because you don't use any Petra . It all you're doing 10 15 mile commute and you've got so much a plug in it work like the guy who uses this car . He works at the BMW dealership .

You might be thinking , I don't need that , actually . But believe me , you do , because without the car just doesn't drive as well as it should .

Because it's brilliant . Bend of these autos are among the best , if not the best in the business . I can't say the same for the manuals they didn't know come with rev matching for smooth down ships . Another good thing is that if you wanted a war drive car because you're living , let's say snow is Scotland or Wales .

So then that's the Mercedes A class is interior dealt with . Now let's find out what it's like to drive so many first dip into this car . The less time driving position in the firm suspension makes anything OK . Yeah , this feels pretty sporty , but you don't have to go 500E seem realized . This is not fun to drive as an Audi A3 Siri's , because when you put into a corner , it starts a room wide a little bit earlier than you might imagine on the steering and say , Yeah , you have no idea what the front wheels are doing as you bounce down the road on the firm suspension , which is made worse if you got larger alloy will or the lowered AMG line suspension . You think by the minute I've been tricked here now you can make it a little bit better . The suspension , by going for the optional dampers around 500 quid and they didn't make the car ride better on they may get handled better as well , but still not as good as its rivals . It just doesn't feel a lot much like just say it is . One way does actually feel like S8 is , though , is that the manual gearboxes are really good to use the automatic , all better wanting a class on as good as what you get .

But then when you want to take control again and have some fun Yeah , you definitely can't , thanks to that high performance engine . So let's just say that some poor person behind you thinks they're going to overtake it . There they are . Look .

I'll just leave this stuff out of the way to Mark A5 recovered . He lets up . Put the seat back . It's simple . We don't release the catch . I get into this car's dead . He's got massive doors that the wheel arches an intruder tall . The high is just right for just flopping into our great , very easy to get into . You got easy access , either . Fix anchor points down here under flip . It covers so you won't lose the covers . What you do with the popoff ones ? Also the senator and back . It's dead . Easy to maneuver a big , bulky child safe . They can see . Look , this season , my usual driving position . I've got loads and loads of room , plenty of head room , even though we've got the panoramic glass freeze here that's really bright now . It's actually good that when it's dark , you little lights there , so it does give you decent reading light . That's not the case in most cars , anyway , back to who I was talking about , so lots of knee room very , very comfy . Now it doesn't feel quite a space in the back as an anti Q7 in part . The reason for that is that you can't slide nor recline the seats , but they are super comfy . There's lots of support under your legs there fairly reclined anyway . Yeah , if you wanna carry three , it's not by the tour . The floor's almost completely flat to this plenty of foot space . The Middle C is slightly firmer , so it's not as comfortable . But you can fit three adults in the back here . In fact , when you check out a detailed practicality video , you can see just what it's like with red dots in the back . So much stuff you can find the boot and how easy it is to fit a child . See speak of children . There'll be more than happy back here , so the wood ledge is quite low . Also . Look , A3 windows go all the way down , which is very unusual these days , so that's good .

But it's a good one . Come out to chassis and suspension has a bit more of a departure to report there . So , yes , the car is bigger in the last three , Siri's got longer wheelbase , but the front track has actually grown in greater proportion and beyond all that you've got , stiffer springs is different . The roll bars stiffer mountings , more negative camber on the front axle , and all of that's going on below a body structure that's 25% more rigid than the last three . Siri's . That's what gives BMW permission to stick up the chassis rights without compromising the right . Hopefully , the really an innovative thing in the chassis , or what BMW calls lift related dampers now , then adaptive dampers and such . But they do have little individual structures within the reservoirs that actually provide Maur damn possible at the extremes of the travel . So A4 compression but full rebound dampers just work a little bit hard , harder for the car , and that allows them to perhaps be a little bit more laid back in fluent right in the middle of travel on that provides more ride comfort theory anyway , you don't want knows . You could have shorter , firmer M6 port suspension springs , which also come with firmer anti roll bars yet more negative camber for those front wheels on variable sport steering and then beyond that . If you want to go even further , you can have adaptive M6 suspension with proper adaptive dampers . DVD , although by and large A3 Siri's by don't tend to go quite that far , which intrigues me , nothing BMW done it so spaced out . The ratios in the eight speed automatic gearbox in the car gets so the shorter ones , the level ones a shorter the high ones are taller and at times . Maybe when you're using manual mode , sometimes you feel like you're in the wrong gear . You know your gear higher , then you expect to be on the computer .

Everything I like about this car , if you want to , you can sit quite low in it . Say it feels just like a slightly grownup hatchback .

And because there's plenty of head room , you're able to do that even if you're quite so .

I really like the look of the front end of this new three . Suze . I think it's got loads of presents . As before , S4 cars have a more aggressive lower from bumper .

This one has integrated laser lights with the rangers in like , 500 meters , and they have , like the four circular design like you had on the E 46 A3 . Siri's really nice . I do like the front and decreasing the bottom . Look good down the sides , though I'm not quite so sure there's various lines increases going about the place . It looks a little bit Slaby . Look , the door handles there kind of is weird . Big cutaways .
